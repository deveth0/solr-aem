[[General]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;James Abercrombie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Abercromby&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1706 &amp;amp;ndash; April 23, 1781) was a [[British Army]] general and commander-in-chief of forces in North America during the [[French and Indian War]], best known for the disastrous British losses in the 1758 [[Battle of Carillon]].

==Early life==
Abercrombie was born in Glassaugh, [[Banffshire]], [[Scotland]] &amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Marquis 1607-1896&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who&amp;apos;s Who | location = Chicago | year = 1963}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; to a wealthy family, and purchased a major&amp;apos;s commission to enter the army in 1742. He was promoted to colonel in 1746, and major-general in 1756.

==Seven Years War==
{{Further2|[[Great Britain in the Seven Years War]]}}
Abercrombie commanded a brigade at [[Fortress Louisbourg|Louisbourg]] in 1757 and became commander-in-chief of the British forces in North America after the departure of [[John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun|John Campbell]] in March 1758 (see [[Commander-in-Chief, North America]]).

That summer, he led an expedition against [[Fort Carillon]] (later known as Fort Ticonderoga). Abercrombie was a genius at organization, but vacillated in his leadership to the point where his troops called him &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mrs. Nanny Cromby&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He managed the remarkable feat of assembling 15,000 troops and moving them and their supplies through the wilderness. Then, on July 8, he directed his troops into a frontal assault on a fortified French position, without the benefit of artillery support. More than 2,000 men were killed or wounded.  Eventually his force panicked and fled, and he retreated to his fortified camp south of [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]]. This disaster caused his replacement by General [[Jeffrey Amherst]] and his recall to Great Britain in 1759. On his return to Britain, he sat as a [[member of parliament]], and supported the coercive policy toward the American colonies.

He is virtually unknown in Britain today.  A reference to &amp;quot;General Abercrombie&amp;quot; is almost certainly to be taken as a reference to the Scots soldier Sir Ralph Abercrombie.
