&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;James Northcote&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Royal Academy of Arts|RA]] (22 October 1746 – 13 July 1831) was an [[England|English]] [[Painting|painter]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Northcote, James|volume=41|pages=190–3}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Life and work==
He was born at [[Plymouth]], and was apprenticed to his father, a poor watchmaker.  In his spare time, he drew and painted. In 1769 he left his father and set up as a [[portrait]] painter. Four years later he went to [[London]] and was admitted as a pupil into the studio and house of Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]]. At the same time he attended the [[Royal Academy]] schools.

In 1775 he left Reynolds, and about two years later, having made some money by portrait painting back in [[Devon]], he went to study in [[Italy]]. On his return to England, three years later, he revisited his native county, then settled in London, where [[John Opie]] and [[Henry Fuseli]] were his rivals. He was elected associate of the Academy in 1786, and full academician in the following spring.  The &amp;quot;Young Princes murdered in the Tower,&amp;quot; his first important work on a historical subject, dates from 1786, and it was followed by the &amp;quot;Burial of the Princes in the Tower&amp;quot;. Both paintings, along with seven others, were intended for Boydell&amp;apos;s [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery|Shakespeare Gallery]]. The &amp;quot;Death of Wat Tyler&amp;quot;, now in the [[Guildhall, London]], was exhibited in 1787; and shortly afterwards Northcote began a set of ten subjects, entitled &amp;quot;The Modest Girl and the Wanton&amp;quot;, which were completed and engraved in 1796. Among the productions of Northcote&amp;apos;s later years are the &amp;quot;Entombment&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Agony in the Garden,&amp;quot; besides many portraits, and several animal subjects, such as &amp;quot;Leopards&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dog and Heron&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Lion&amp;quot;; these were more successful than the artist&amp;apos;s efforts in the higher departments of art, as was indicated by Fuseli&amp;apos;s caustic remark on examining the &amp;quot;Angel opposing Balaam&amp;quot; —&amp;quot;Northcote, you are an angel at an ass, but an ass at an angel.&amp;quot; Northcote&amp;apos;s works number about two thousand, and he made a fortune of £40,000.

He was elected to the [[Royal Academy]] in 1787.  He sponsored the admission in 1829 of [[Thomas Sewell Robins]] to the Royal Academy Schools.

==Writings==
Northcote also sought fame as an author, and his first essays were contributions to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Artist&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, edited by [[Prince Hoare (younger)|Prince Hoare]]. In 1813 he embodied his recollections of his old master in a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Life of Reynolds&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fables&amp;apos;&amp;apos;—the first series published in 1828, the second posthumously in 1833—were illustrated with woodcuts by Harvey from Northcote&amp;apos;s own designs. In the production of his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Life of Titian&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, his last work, which appeared in 1830, he was assisted by [[William Hazlitt]], who previously, in 1826, had given to the public in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[New Monthly Magazine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; his recollections of Northcote&amp;apos;s pungent and cynical &amp;quot;conversations&amp;quot;, causing some problems for the painter and his friends.
