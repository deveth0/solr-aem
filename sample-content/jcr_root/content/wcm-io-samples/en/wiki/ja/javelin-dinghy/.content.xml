The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Javelin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 14-foot dinghy designed by [[Uffa Fox]] in 1960  and built by the O&amp;apos;Day company until the mid-1980s. The boat is a comfortable daysailer. Over 5000 were produced in the United States and they are still being built in Japan.

The Javelin sails off a [[Portsmouth Yardstick|D-PN]] of 111.3&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;UScb&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://offshore.ussailing.org/Portsmouth_Yardstick/Current_Tables/Centerboard_Classes.htm |title=Centerboard Classes |publisher=US Sailing |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
