        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;James Walker Tufts&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 11, 1835 &amp;amp;ndash; February 3, 1902), is probably best known for his founding of [[Pinehurst, North Carolina|The Village of Pinehurst]], [[North Carolina]] ([[USA]]). He also founded the Arctic Soda Fountain Co. and eventually merged with A. D. Puffer &amp;amp; Sons ([[Boston, Massachusetts]]), John Matthews ([[New York City, New York]]), and Charles Lippincott ([[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]) to form the [[American Soda Fountain Co]]. Tufts was the inventor of the [[Arctic Soda Fountain]] and was installed as the first president of the merger that formed American Soda Fountain.

Tufts was born in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]] to Leonard Tufts and Hepzebah Fosdick Tufts. He was &amp;quot;an entrepreneur, inventor, and philanthropist. He rose from being a sixteen-year-old drug store apprentice to becoming a wealthy businessman who had the vision and determination to build Pinehurst, in only six months.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Welcome to the Tufts Archives&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.tuftsarchives.org/tufts_template.htm Welcome to the Tufts Archives&amp;lt;!-- bot-generated title --&amp;gt;] at www.tuftsarchives.org&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 1895, Tufts initially purchased {{convert|500|acre|km2}}, and eventually purchased an additional {{convert|5500|acre|km2}}, of land for approximately $1.25 per acre in the [[Sandhills (Carolina)|North Carolina Sandhills]], with the vision of building a &amp;quot;health resort for people of modest means&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Welcome to the Tufts Archives&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Originally dubbed &amp;quot;Tuftstown&amp;quot; during development, Tuftstown became the village of Pinehurst, and home of the [[Pinehurst Resort]]â€”the name was chosen from a list of losing names proposed for [[Martha&amp;apos;s Vineyard]].

Tufts hired the landscape architecture firm started by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] to do the initial city planning; because his health was failing, Olmsted himself was unable to play an active role.

Pinehurst later became known for its golf courses with the arrival of golf pro [[Donald Ross (golfer)|Donald Ross]] (originally of [[Dornoch, Scotland]]) in December, 1900. Ross designed four of Pinehurst&amp;apos;s golf courses.

Tufts died in Pinehurst in 1902. Pinehurst was controlled by the Tufts family until 1970. James Tufts&amp;apos;s son [[Leonard Tufts|Leonard]], and his grandson, [[Richard Tufts|Richard]], succeeded him.
