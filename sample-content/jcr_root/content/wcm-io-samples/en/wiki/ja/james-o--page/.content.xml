During the early 1970s Jim Page served as a technical advisor for NBC Television&amp;apos;s popular show &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Emergency!]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; This program captured the US public&amp;apos;s imagination and created a public demand for quality pre-hospital care. In 1976 Page took the leadership reins of the ACT Foundation becoming a popular public speaker, advisor, and author of topics in emergency medicine{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. The character of Johnny Gage, a paramedic that appeared on the series was considered to have been named in honor of Page, although the name had been changed, so as to keep in context.

Page published several books and magazines about the EMS community.  He is generally recognized as the official historian of EMS.
