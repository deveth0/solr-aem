        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Janine Pommy Vega&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 5, 1942 &amp;amp;ndash; December 23, 2010)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.janinepommyvega.com/quickinfo.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was an [[United States poetry|American]] [[poet]] associated with the [[Beat generation|Beats]].

Vega grew up in [[Union City, New Jersey]]. At the age of sixteen, inspired by [[Jack Kerouac|Jack Kerouac&amp;apos;s]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[On the Road]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, she travelled to [[Manhattan]] to become involved in the [[Beat generation|Beat scene]] there.

In 1962, Vega moved to [[Europe]] with her husband, painter Fernando Vega. After his sudden death in Spain in 1965, she returned to [[New York]], and then moved to [[California]]. Her first book, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Poems to Fernando&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was published by [[City Lights Bookstore|City Lights]] in 1968 as part of their [[City Lights Pocket Poets Series]]. During the early-1970s, Vega  lived as a hermit on the [[Isla del Sol]] in [[Lake Titicaca]] on the Bolivian-Peruvian border. Out of this self-imposed exile came &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Journal of a Hermit&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1974) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Morning Passage&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1976).

Following her return to the Americas, she has published more than a dozen books, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tracking the Serpent: Journeys to Four Continents&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1997) which is a collection of travel writings. Her last book of poetry was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Green Piano&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Vega, Janine Pommy (2005), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Green Piano: New Poems&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, David R. Godine, Publisher. ISBN 1-57423-207-X&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the 1970s, Vega began working as an educator in schools through various arts in education programs and in prisons through the Incisions/Arts organisation. She has served on the [[International PEN|PEN]] Prison Writing Committee. Pommy Vega was a pioneer of the women&amp;apos;s movement in the United States. She had worked to improve the lives, conditions, and opportunities for women in prison. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Vega had traveled throughout the North American and South American continents, all throughout Europe, including Eastern Europe, countries in the Middle East, often alone. She made friends everywhere, approaching all on the same, basic, human level, with love and compassion.
