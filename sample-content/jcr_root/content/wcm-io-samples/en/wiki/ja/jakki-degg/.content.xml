==Career==
===Modeling===
Jakki became famous when, at her mother&amp;apos;s encouragement,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;askmen.com&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; she entered and won the inaugural [[Max Power (magazine)|Max Power]] magazine babes competition.  Following this she became a [[Page Three girl|Page 3 girl]] for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; newspaper, and was voted &amp;quot;greatest ever Page 3 girl&amp;quot; in 2001.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.page3.com/girl/jakki_degg/biog.shtml&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  She has posed topless and semi-nude for lad mags such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Front (magazine)|Front]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Degg took a break from topless modelling, preferring to remain more covered up. Jakki returned to page 3 of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Sun&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in August 2006 after a four-year absence.

===Acting===
Jakki has appeared on television several times.  She had a small role in the drama &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Is Harry on the Boat?]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Sky One]]) and played the lead in the short film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Remember My Dream&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, directed by [[Joao Costa Menezes]].  She was also a stand-in for the TV show &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Games&amp;apos;&amp;apos; but was not used. She wielded a shotgun on [[Channel 4]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Banzai (television show)|Banzai]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as viewers were encouraged to wager on how many balloons she would pop with it.

Degg won the Page 3 model charity special edition of [[BBC One|BBC1]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Weakest Link]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, beating [[Leilani Dowding]] in the sudden death round, with her winnings going to the [[RSPCA]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/life/185539/Jakki-has-the-most-up-top.html| title = Jakki has the most up top!| date = 2002-07-13| author = Giovanni Iozzi| publisher = The Sun| accessdate=2009-10-09}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; However, her appearance on the show&amp;apos;s 1,000th episode was short lived, as she was the first contestant eliminated on a countback.
