&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jacob of Juterbogk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (c. 1381 – 30 April 1465) was a [[Germany|German]] [[monk]] and [[theology|theologian]]. Benedict Stolzenhagen, known in religion as Jacob, was born at [[Jüterbog]] in [[Brandenburg]] of poor peasant stock. He became a [[Cistercian]] at the [[monastery]] of [[Paradiz]] in [[Poland]], and was, sent by the abbot to the university of [[Kraków]], where he became master in philosophy and doctor of theology. He returned to his monastery, of which he became abbot. In 1441, however, discontented with the absence of strict discipline in his community, he obtained the leave of the [[papal]] legate at the [[council of Basel]] to transfer himself to the [[Carthusians]], entering the monastery of [[Salvatorberg]] near [[Erfurt]], of which he became prior. He lectured on theology at the [[University of Erfurt]], of which he was rector in 1456, and wrote around eighty treatises.  Like many men of his time, he promoted [[Conciliarism]], the idea that a general council should be above the pope.
