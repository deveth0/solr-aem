&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;James Alexander Jerome&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Queen&amp;apos;s Privy Council for Canada|PC]] (March 4, 1933 â€“ August 21, 2005) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] jurist and former politician and [[Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons]].

==Life and career==
After receiving his law degree from [[Osgoode Hall]] in [[Toronto]], Jerome began his law practice in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]]. In 1966, he won a seat on Sudbury&amp;apos;s city council and, the next year, attempted to win election to the [[Canadian House of Commons]] in a [[by-election]] but was defeated. He took the seat in the [[Canadian federal election, 1968|1968 general election]], however, and became the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[Sudbury (electoral district)|Sudbury riding]].

After the [[Canadian federal election, 1972|1972 election]], Jerome became Chairman of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. Since there was a [[minority government]] in place, the opposition had a majority of members on the Committee and Jerome had to remain impartial and balance the wishes of all parties in order to win approval for legislation.

His success in this role led [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] to appoint Jerome as Speaker of the House of Commons following the [[Canadian federal election, 1974|1974 election]].

In the [[Canadian federal election, 1979|1979 election]], Jerome considered following the precedent set by his predecessor, [[Lucien Lamoureux]] by running as an independent as is the custom of the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons]]. He decided to run as a Liberal, however, and was re-elected. The [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] formed a [[minority government]]. Despite the change in government, they decided to keep Jerome as Speaker, the first time a member of an opposition party was chosen to preside over the Canadian House of Commons.

After the Clark government was defeated in a [[Motion of No Confidence]] in December 1979, Jerome decided not to run in the ensuing general election. In January 1980, Clark appointed him Associate Chief Justice of the Federal Court in Ottawa. Jerome remained in this position until his retirement in 1998.
