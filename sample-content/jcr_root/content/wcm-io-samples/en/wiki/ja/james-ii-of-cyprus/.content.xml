        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;James II (the Bastard) of Cyprus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jacques II le BÃ¢tard [[House of Lusignan|de Lusignan]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Nicosia]], c. 1438/1439 or c. 1440 &amp;amp;ndash; [[Famagusta]], July 10, 1473), was the illegitimate son of [[John II of Cyprus]] and [[Marietta de Patras]].

==Archbishop of Nicosia==
James was a great favourite of his father, and in 1456, at the age of 16, he was appointed to the [[archbishopric of Nicosia]]. After murdering Iacopo Urri, the Royal [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] on 1 April 1457,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Benjamin Arbel and David Jacoby, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Intercultural Contacts in the Medieval Mediterranean&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p. 45, published by Frank Cass, London, Google Books, retrieved on 19 June 2009&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; he was deprived of the archbishopric and fled to [[Rhodes]] on a ship of the Catalan [[Juan Tafures]]. He was pardoned by his father, and the archbishopric was returned to him.

==King of Cyprus==
In 1458 his father died, and his half-sister [[Charlotte of Cyprus|Charlotte]] became Queen of [[Cyprus]]. In 1460, with support from the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egyptian Mamluk]] sultan [[Sayf ad-Din Inal]], James challenged her right to the throne, blockading her and her husband in the castle of [[Kyrenia]] for three years. When Charlotte fled to [[Rome]] in 1463, James was crowned King. In gratitude, he made his friend and supporter Juan Tafures [[Master of the Household|Master of his Household]] and Titular [[Count of Tripoli]].

==Marriage, death and succession==
In [[Venice]], on July 30, 1468, seeking political support, he married a 14-year old Venetian, [[Catherine Cornaro]], by proxy. She finally travelled to Cyprus and married in person at [[Famagusta]] in October or November, 1472. James died a few months later, amidst some suspicion that he might have been poisoned by agents of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], possibly by Catherine&amp;apos;s uncles. According to his will, Caterina, who was pregnant, became regent. The couple&amp;apos;s son [[James III of Cyprus|James]] died under suspicious circumstances in 1474 before his first birthday, leaving Catherine as regent of Cyprus. During her reign the island was controlled by Venetian merchants. In 1489 Venice forced her to abdicate, and Cyprus became a colony of the [[Republic of Venice]] until it was captured by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1571.

==Literary note==
The civil war between James II and Charlotte of Cyprus forms the historical background to the events of [[Dorothy Dunnett|Dorothy Dunnett&amp;apos;s]] novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Race of Scorpions&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Illegitimate children==
Prior to his marriage, King James II had four natural children:
