&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jada Rowland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born February 23, 1943 on [[Staten Island]], [[New York City]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[actress]] and [[illustrator]].

==Actress==
Ms. Rowland was born into a family of actors and artists.  She has appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[television]], most notably in daytime [[soap opera]]s. She has appeared as Dr. Susan Stewart on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[As the World Turns]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and Carolee Simpson Aldrich on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Doctors (1963 TV series)|The Doctors]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  She later appeared on the prime-time serial &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Hamptons]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.   She was offered an audition for the [[Dustin Hoffman]] film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Tootsie]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

She is the sister of former actor Jeffrey Rowland. He, at one time, played her husband on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;As the World Turns&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Dr. Dan Stewart), although they appeared on this show during different years.

Her most notable role was that of [[Amy Ames|Amy Ames Britton Kincaid]] on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Secret Storm]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for most of its twenty-year run.

The character Amy had the distinction of growing up in real time, rather than the often-used soap opera phenomenon of rapid aging, where a younger actor is replaced with an older actor in order to age the character more quickly.

In the early 1970s, she lost the father of her son, Sparks, to murder.

Ms. Rowland&amp;apos;s biography on her webpage says: &amp;quot;And finally, in 1983, tired of acting, never having been unemployed for more than three months at a time, and having the opportunity to join her astrophysicist husband on sabbatical in Denmark, she took a big gamble.  She decided to fulfill a lifelong desire to be a professional artist and writer; she quit acting.  She has kept on drawing and painting and writing.&amp;quot;

==Illustrator==
Published [[children&amp;apos;s books]] she has illustrated include: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bringing the Farmhouse Home&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (by Gloria Whelan, Simon &amp;amp; Schuster Books for Young Readers, 1992); &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Miss Tizzy&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (by Libba Moore Gray, Simon &amp;amp; Schuster Books for Young Readers, 1993); &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Statue of Liberty&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (by Lucille Recht Penner, Random House, 1995); and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Raising the Roof&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (by Ronald Kidd, Habitat for Humanity International, 1995).

==Residence==
She resides in [[Manhattan]].
