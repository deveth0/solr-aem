It is now considered a [[legacy system]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;CDCFAQ&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

== History ==

JavaOS was originally announced in 1996 by Sun&amp;apos;s JavaSoft subsidiary as a compact OS designed to run &amp;quot;in anything from net computers to pagers&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;announce&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; In 1998, Sun recruited [[IBM]] to accelerate its development.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news

In 1999, Sun and IBM announced the end of the JavaOS project.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;CNet&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news

}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; As early as 2003, Sun materials referred to JavaOS as a &amp;quot;[[legacy system|legacy technology]]&amp;quot;, recommending migration to [[Java ME]], leaving the choice of specific OS and Java environment to the implementer.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;CDCFAQ&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web

== Design ==
The system is based on a hardware architecture native [[microkernel]]. The Java virtual machine runs on top of the microkernel.

Platforms that the kernel runs on include:
* [[ARM architecture|ARM]]
* [[PowerPC]]
* [[SPARC]]
* [[StrongARM]]
* [[IA-32]]

All [[device driver]]s are written in Java and executed by the virtual machine.

A graphics and windowing system implementing the [[Abstract Window Toolkit|AWT]] [[Application programming interface|API]] is also written in Java.

== Applications ==
JavaOS was designed to run on [[embedded system]]s and has applications in devices such as [[set top box]]es, [[computer network|networking]] infrastructure and [[automatic teller machine|ATMs]]. It&amp;apos;s also the operating system that comes with the [[JavaStation]].
