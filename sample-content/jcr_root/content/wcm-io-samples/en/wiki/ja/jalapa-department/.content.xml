&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jalapa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[departments of Guatemala|department]] of [[Guatemala]], in the south east-of the republic. The capital is the city of [[Jalapa, Guatemala|Jalapa]].

In 2000 the department of Jalapa had an estimated population of  390,500. The majority is ladino, of predominantly [[European ethnic groups|European]] descent, with sizable minorities of [[K&amp;apos;iche&amp;apos; people|K&amp;apos;iche&amp;apos;]] and [[Poqomam people|Poqomam]] Maya. The main agricultural products are cattle, sorghum, tobacco, onion and maize (corn).

Recently, a program called Wells of Hope has been started in this area. The program focuses mainly on drilling wells so that the people can receive clean water. However, the program also does other things, such as building schools and educating the people to become more self-sufficient.
