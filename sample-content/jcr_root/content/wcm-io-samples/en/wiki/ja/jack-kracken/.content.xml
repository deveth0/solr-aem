        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jack Kracken&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, born Emil Ecklund, was a [[Norway|Norwegian]]&amp;amp;ndash;[[United States|American]] boxer of the 1930s.

==Biography==
Emil Ecklund was born in [[Lillehammer]] in [[Oppland]] county, [[Norway]]. Ecklund emigrated from [[Gudbrandsdal]] to the United States. Emil Ecklund climbed into the ring under his real name and as Jack Kracken in a journeyman’s career that lasted 17 [[Professional boxing|professional boxing matches]] between 1930 to 1934.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://pub.tv2.no/dyn-nettavisen/printversion/article.jsp?id=742100 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Emil Ecklund fra Gudbrandsdalen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Norwegian boxing records by Alister Scott Ottesen)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1930, Ecklund  dropped three consecutive matches in [[Illinois]]. On April 1 in [[Springfield, Illinois]] he was knocked out in round three by George Kutulis,  lost a six-round decision to Fred Caldori on April 25 in [[Chicago]] and suffered a technical knockout at the hands of [[King Levinsky]] on August 29 in Chicago.  The losing streak stretched to four when Ecklund was KO’d  by Walter Pickard on March 30, 1931, in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].

From November 30, 1931, to November 2, 1932, Ecklund toured four Washington cities and [[Vancouver, British Columbia]]  for a pair of wins over Sam Eisman and a  victory over Jack Yenter. On December 2, 1932 in [[Bremerton, Washington]], Battling Mix knocked down Ecklund five times. On February 13, 1933, Ecklund defeated Chick McBride in rounds two and three at the Bremerton Athletic Club and subsequently in [[Silverdale, Washington]] on February 23, 1933.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=156361&amp;amp;cat=boxer &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Battling Mix&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (BoxRec)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Jack Kracken is best remembered as the first boxer defeated by [[Joe Louis]] on July 4, 1934 in the first round of a scheduled six-round bout at Bacon Casino on [[South Side (Chicago)|Chicago’s South Side]].  Kracken was one of Chicago&amp;apos;s top heavyweights at the time he fought Louis.  It was Kracken&amp;apos;s last appearance in the ring. Jack Kracken  finished his career with 10 wins (all by knockout) and 7 losses.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/coreno/236029 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mystery in the History&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Sporting News)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://coxscorner.tripod.com/louis_record.html &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Joe Louis record&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (coxscorner.tripod.com)] (accessed 1 February 2007)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
