&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;James Kidd Flemming&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 27, 1868 – February 10, 1927) was a businessman and politician in [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]].

Flemming was a [[school teacher]] and lumberman before entering politics and serving as [[Department of Finance (New Brunswick)|Provincial Secretary-Treasurer]] from 1908 to 1911 and [[Department of Natural Resources (New Brunswick)|Minister of Lands and Mines]] from 1911-1914. He succeeded [[John Douglas Hazen|Douglas Hazen]] as the [[Premier of New Brunswick]] in 1911. In June 1912, Flemming led his provincial party to the biggest electoral victory in its history. In addition to two independent Conservative seats, the Conservative Party captured 42 of the province&amp;apos;s 46 seats.

Under Flemming, the [[French language]] was used for the first time in the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]].

In 1914, Premier Flemming was forced to resign after charges of fundraising irregularities against him were made public by a powerful group of back-room [[New Brunswick Liberal Association|Liberals]] known as the &amp;quot;Dark Lantern Brigade&amp;quot; led by party organizers [[Peter Veniot]] and [[Edward S. Carter]] plus [[lawyer]] and [[House of Commons of Canada|Federal Member of Parliament]], [[Frank Broadstreet Carvell|Frank Carvell]].

Nevertheless, Flemming remained popular and won a [[Legislative seat|seat]] in the [[Canadian House of Commons]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1925|1925 federal election]] and again in the [[Canadian federal election, 1926|1926 election]].

He was president and director of the Flemming and Gibson lumber business in [[Juniper, New Brunswick]]. His son, [[Hugh John Flemming]] took over the business and too entered politics, serving as Premier of New Brunswick from 1952 to 1960.

James Kidd Flemming suffered from poor health for many of his adult years and died in 1927 at age fifty-eight. He and his wife Helena are buried in the family plot at the Methodist Church Cemetery in [[Woodstock, New Brunswick]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.gnb.ca/APPS/NBCemeteries/Details.aspx?culture=en-CA&amp;amp;Key=80380|title=FLEMMING, James Kidd (Hon.)|work=New Brunswick Cemeteries|publisher=[[Provincial Archives of New Brunswick]]|accessdate=2 November 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
