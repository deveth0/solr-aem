        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jan Carstenszoon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or more commonly &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jan Carstensz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;In Dutch [[patronym]]s ending in -szoon were almost universally abbreviated to -sz&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) was a 17th-century [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[explorer]].

In 1623, Carstenszoon was commissioned by the [[Dutch East India Company]] to lead an expedition to the southern coast of [[New Guinea]] and beyond, to follow up the reports of land sighted further south in the 1606 voyages of [[Willem Janszoon]] in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Duyfken]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Setting sail from [[Ambon Island|Amboyna]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] with two [[ship]]s, the [[Pera (ship)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pera&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] and [[Arnhem (ship)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arnhem&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] (captained by Willem Joosten Van Colster).&amp;lt;ref name=DEA&amp;gt;{{cite book |title= The Discovery and Exploration of Australia|last= Feeken |first= Erwin H. J.  |coauthors= Gerda E.E. Feeken |year= 1970 |publisher= Nelson |location= Melbourne |isbn= 0-17-001812-1 |page=37 |url= http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1131761 |accessdate=2009-07-10}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The ships travelled along the south coast of New Guinea, then headed south to Cape York Peninsula and the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. On 14 April 1623, Cape Keerweer was passed.&amp;lt;ref name=DEA/&amp;gt; Landing in search of fresh [[water]] for his stores, Carstenszoon encountered a party of the local [[indigenous Australian]] inhabitants. Carstenszoon described them as &amp;quot;poor and miserable looking people&amp;quot; who had &amp;quot;no knowledge of [[precious metal]]s or [[spice]]s&amp;quot;.

On 8 May 1623, Carstenszoon and his crew fought a skirmish with 200 Aborigines at the mouth of a small river near [[Cape Duyfken]] (named after Janszoon&amp;apos;s vessel which had earlier visited the region) and landed at the [[Pennefather River]]. Carstenszoon named the small river [[Carpentier River]], and the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] in honour of [[Pieter de Carpentier]], at that time [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]]. Carstenszoon reached the Staaten River before heading north again. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pera&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and Carstenszoon returned to Ambon while the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arnhem&amp;apos;&amp;apos; crossed the Gulf of Carpentaria, sighting the east coast of [[Arnhem Land]].

[[Carstensz Pyramid]], [[Irian Jaya]], [[Indonesia]] was named after him. Carstenszoon sighted the [[glacier]]s on the peak of the mountain in 1623; he was ridiculed in [[Europe]] when he said he had seen [[snow]] near the [[equator]].

Carstenszoon also named several other features along [[Australia]]&amp;apos;s north coast. See also [[European exploration of Australia]]
