        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jacob ben Asher&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ba&amp;apos;al ha-Turim&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as well as Rabbi Yaakov ben Raash (Rabbeinu Asher), was probably born in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at [[Cologne]] about 1269 and probably died at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], then in the [[Kingdom of Castile]], about 1343.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Translated from Hebrew biography in Bar Ilan CD-ROM&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Goldin, Hyman E. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]] - Code of Jewish Law&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Forward to the New Edition. (New York: Hebrew Publishing Company, 1961)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Jacob was an influential [[Medieval]] [[rabbi|rabbinic authority]]. He is often referred to as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baal ha-Turim&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Master of the Rows&amp;quot;), after his main work in [[halakha]] (Jewish law), the [[Arba&amp;apos;ah Turim]] (&amp;quot;Four Rows&amp;quot;). The work was divided into 4 sections, each called a &amp;quot;tur,&amp;quot; alluding to the rows of jewels on the High Priest&amp;apos;s breastplate. He was the third son of the Rabbi [[Asher ben Jehiel]] (known as the &amp;quot;Rosh&amp;quot;), a  Rabbi of the Holy Roman Empire who moved to Castile. Besides his father, who was his principal teacher, Jacob quotes very often in the Turim his elder brother Jehiel; once his brother Judah (see Tur Orach Chaim, ยง 417), and once his uncle Rabbi Chaim (ib. ยง 49). According to many,{{By whom|date=July 2010}} Jacob moved to Castile with his father and was not born there.

Some say Jacob succeeded his father as the rabbi of the Jewish community of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] (Zacuto), while others say his brother [[Judah ben Asher]] did. His brothers were also rabbis of different communities in [[Iberia]]. He lived in abject poverty most of his life, and according to The [[Sephardic]] Community of Chios, is said to have fallen ill and died with his 10 companions on the island of [[Chios]], in [[Greece]], whilst travelling.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sephardicstudies.org/chios.html The Sephardic Community of Chios&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Works==
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Arba&amp;apos;ah Turim]],&amp;apos;&amp;apos; one of the most important [[halachic]] books of all times.
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sefer ha-Remazim,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;quot;Kitzur Piske ha-Rosh&amp;quot; (Constantinople, 1575), an abridgment of his father&amp;apos;s compendium of the Talmud, in which he condensed his father&amp;apos;s decisions, omitting the casuistry.
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rimze Ba&amp;apos;al ha-Turim&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Constantinople, 1500), a commentary on the Pentateuch, which is printed in virtually all Jewish editions of the Pentateuch. This concise commentary consists of mystical and symbolical references in the Torah text (see [[Masoretic text]]), often using [[gematria]] and acronyms as well as other occurrences of particular words elsewhere in the [[Torah]].
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Perush Al ha-Torah,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; a less known commentary on the Pentateuch (Zolkiev, 1806), taken mainly from [[Nachmanides]], but without his cabalistic and philosophical interpretations. Jacob quotes many other commentators, among them [[Saadia Gaon]], [[Rashi]], [[Joseph Dara]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]].
