&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jaan Ehlvest&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 14 October 1962) is a [[chess]] player, who was awarded the title of [[International Grandmaster|Grandmaster]] by [[FIDE]] in 1987 and was named Estonian sportsman of the year in 1987 and 1989. Since 2006, he has represented the [[United States of America|United States]].

He was briefly a world top 10 player when, in 1991, he ascended to the number 5 slot on FIDE&amp;apos;s official list with an [[Elo rating]] of 2650.

Jaan Ehlvest&amp;apos;s brother, [[Jüri Ehlvest]], was a well-known writer in Estonia.

==Biography==
Ehlvest&amp;apos;s tournament victories include the 1980 USSR Junior Chess Championship,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://al20102007.narod.ru/ch_urs/1980/ch_jun80.html|title=29th USSR Junior Chess Championship Dushanbe 5–18.1.1980|publisher=RusBase|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; the 1983 [[European Junior Chess Championship|European Junior Championship]], the 1986 [[Estonian Chess Championship|Estonian Championship]], the 1994 New York Open, and the 2003 World Open in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. When SK Rockaden won the 2001 [[Sweden|Swedish]] championship they fielded Ehlvest.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/chess/chessdaily0401.html &amp;quot;Rockaden win Swedish league&amp;quot;], Mind Sports Worldwide, 25 March 2001&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Ehlvest studied psychology at [[Tartu]] State University. In 2004, Ehlvest published his autobiography, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Story of a Chess Player&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 2006, unsatisfied with the lack of support from the Estonian Chess Federation, Ehlvest decided to move to the United States; since then, he has been a member of the [[United States Chess Federation|USCF]] and competed internationally for the USA.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In March 2007, Ehlvest accepted an invitation to play an unusual eight-game match against the chess program [[Rybka]], one of the strongest chess programs in existence. He was playing Black in all games, but was given pawn odds (Rybka was playing each game a pawn down; different white pawn was removed in each game). He lost the match by 2½:5½ (+1−4=3). In a following rematch, the pawn odds were removed, Ehlvest was given White in every game, twice the time on the clock, and significant computational handicaps were placed on the machine. Ehlvest lost decisively, 1½:4½.

==Olympiad career==
He was a member of the gold-medal winning [[Soviet Union]] team at the [[28th Chess Olympiad]] in Thessaloniki 1988&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olimpbase.org/1988/1988urs.html|title=28th Chess Olympiad, Thessaloniki 1988, Soviet Union|publisher=OlimpBase|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and played for Estonia in the Chess Olympiads of 1992–2004.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olimpbase.org/players/x9dj75hd.html|title=Men&amp;apos;s Chess Olympiads: Jaan Ehlvest|publisher=OlimpBase|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
