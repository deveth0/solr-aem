A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;jagir&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Devanagari]]: जागीर, [[Persian language|Persian]]: جاگیر, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ja-&amp;apos;&amp;apos; meaning &amp;quot;place&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;-gir&amp;apos;&amp;apos; meaning &amp;quot;keeping, holding&amp;quot;)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.translationdirectory.com/glossaries/glossary189.htm#J&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was a type of feudal land grant in [[South Asia]] bestowed by a monarch to a feudal superior in recognition of his administrative and/or military service. The word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;jagir&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a distorted form of the more formal [[Sanskrit]] term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;jehagiri&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;jagir&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was technically a feudal [[life estate]], as the grant lawfully reverted to the monarch upon the feudal superior&amp;apos;s  death. However, in practice, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;jagirs&amp;apos;&amp;apos; became hereditary by [[primogeniture]]. The recipient of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;jagir&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (termed a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;jagirdar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;de facto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ruler of the territory and was able to earn income from tax revenues and had magisterial authority . The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;jagirdar&amp;apos;&amp;apos; would typically reside at the capital to serve as a [[Minister (government)|Minister]], typically appearing twice a day before the monarch.

This [[feudal]] system of land ownership is referred to as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;jagirdar&amp;apos;&amp;apos; system.  It was first established in the 13th century by the [[Sultans]] of [[Delhi]], was later adopted by the [[Maratha Empire]] in the early 17th century, and continued under the [[British East India Company]].  Shortly following independence from the [[British Crown]] in 1947, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;jagirdar&amp;apos;&amp;apos; system was abolished by the [[Indian government]] in 1951.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book
