&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Japanese Whispers: The Cure Singles Nov 82: Nov 83&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a singles album by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[musical group|group]] [[The Cure]]. It was released in late 1983 by their [[record company]], [[Fiction Records]].

It includes the [[single (music)|singles]] &amp;quot;Let&amp;apos;s Go to Bed&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Walk&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Lovecats&amp;quot;. Two other tracks are the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s of these singles, although &amp;quot;Mr. Pink Eyes&amp;quot; (the second B-side for &amp;quot;The Lovecats&amp;quot;) was not included. The songs were recorded when the band was in a transitional phase after [[bassist]] [[Simon Gallup]] left following a tour to promote the previous album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pornography (album)|Pornography]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Beginning with these singles, [[Lol Tolhurst]] switched from [[drum kit|drums]] to [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], a role he kept until his departure in 1989.

For first two singles&amp;apos; tracks The Cure is a duo consisting of Tolhurst and [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]], with the addition of a session [[drummer]] for the tracks from &amp;quot;Let&amp;apos;s Go to Bed&amp;quot;. For the last single, a full band was assembled with the addition of [[bassist]]/[[record producer|producer]] [[Phil Thornalley]], who had worked with the band on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pornography&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and drummer [[Andy Anderson (drummer)|Andy Anderson]], a lineup which would continue for the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Concert (album)|Concert]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[live album]].

In 1986, the singles&amp;apos; lead tracks were included in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Staring at the Sea]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[compilation album]], while all of the B-sides have been included in the 2004 B-sides and rarities [[box set]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Join the Dots: B-Sides and Rarities, 1978-2001 (The Fiction Years)|Join The Dots]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
