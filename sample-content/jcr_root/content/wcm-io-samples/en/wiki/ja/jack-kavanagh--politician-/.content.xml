        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Patrick Marcus &amp;quot;Jack&amp;quot; Kavanagh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (12 July 1879 &amp;amp;ndash; 6 July 1964) moved to [[Australia]] in 1925, and was a central leader of the [[Communist Party of Australia]] until 1930, when the [[Stalinist]] [[Comintern]] removed him from the leadership. He was expelled from the party in January 1931, readmitted, and then expelled a second time in 1934 after being accused of [[Trotskyism]]. In 1940, Kavanagh joined the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Communist League of Australia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which was the Australian section of the [[Fourth International]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.socialisthistory.ca/Docs/TrotOrigin/Kavanagh.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

His wife&amp;apos;s name was Kylsea, and he had one brother, Quinn.
