The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Japan Australia Migratory Bird Agreement&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;JAMBA&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a treaty between [[Australia]] and [[Japan]] to minimise harm to the major areas used by birds which migrate between the two countries. [[Towra Point Nature Reserve]] plays a role in the agreement, being an area in Australia used by [[Bird migration|migratory birds]]. JAMBA was first developed on February 6, 1974 and came into force on April 30, 1981.

JAMBA provides for cooperation between Japan and Australia on measures for the management and protection of migratory birds, birds in danger of extinction, and the management and protection of their environments, and requires each country to take appropriate measures to preserve and enhance the environment of birds protected under the provisions of the agreement.

There is also a China Australia Migratory Bird Agreement, known as [[CAMBA]]. Towra Point is also a [[Ramsar wetland site]] (a protected wetland of international importance).
