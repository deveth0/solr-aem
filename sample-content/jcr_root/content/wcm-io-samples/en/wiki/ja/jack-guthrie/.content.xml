&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jack Guthrie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (13 November 1915&amp;amp;nbsp;â€“ 15 January 1948) was a songwriter and performer whose rewritten version of the [[Woody Guthrie]] song &amp;quot;[[Oklahoma Hills]]&amp;quot; was a hit in 1945.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Whitburn, p 40&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Whitburn, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country Hits&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p. 146.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The two musicians were cousins.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;guth&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Logsdon, Guy, &amp;quot;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/G/GU005.html Guthrie, Leon Jerry &amp;quot;Jack&amp;quot; (1915-1948)],&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/ Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (accessed May 26, 2010).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Early life==
Born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Leon Jerry Guthrie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Olive, Oklahoma]], he was the son of the younger brother of Woody Guthrie&amp;apos;s father.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;guth&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; He grew up around horses and musical instruments before the family moved to [[California]] in the mid-1930s, where he took on the nicknames &amp;quot;Jack&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Oklahoma&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Oke&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;guth&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; He competed in rodeo as a bucking-horse rider and in 1937 traveled with Woody to Los Angeles where they landed on the Oke &amp;amp; Woody Show on KFVD radio in Hollywood.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;guth&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Career in music==
Guthrie&amp;apos;s rewritten version of a Woody Guthrie song &amp;quot;[[Oklahoma Hills]]&amp;quot; (Capitol 201) reached No. 1 in 1945, staying on the charts for 19 weeks.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Whitburn, p 40&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; The b side, &amp;quot;I&amp;apos;m A Brandin&amp;apos; My Darlin&amp;apos; With My Heart&amp;quot;, reached No. 5 later that year. At the time the record became a hit Jack Guthrie was in the [[U.S. Army]] and stationed in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]]. As soon as he got out of the service he wrote and recorded more songs, played live [[Gig (musical performance)|gig]]s up and down the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. His version of &amp;quot;[[Oakie Boogie]]&amp;quot; (Capitol 341), a hit at No.&amp;amp;nbsp;3 in 1947, is considered a candidate for the [[first rock and roll record]]. In July 1947 he was admitted to a hospital with [[tuberculosis]]. He died in 1948 in [[Livermore, California|Livermore]], [[California]].

Guthrie&amp;apos;s style was influenced by [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and adapted to fit his cowboy image.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;guth&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Although the labels listed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jack Guthrie and His Oklahomans&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as the artist, in reality Guthrie had no band. The studio brought in some of its better musicians to back Guthrie. Many of them, [[Porky Freeman]], [[Red Murrell]], [[Cliffie Stone]], and [[Billy Hughes (musician)|Billy Hughes]] among them, were stars in their own right.
