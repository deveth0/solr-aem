&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;James Richard Cross&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]] (born September 29, 1921) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] former diplomat in [[Canada]] who was kidnapped by [[Front de libération du Québec]] (FLQ) militants during the [[October Crisis]] of October 1970.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.histori.ca/peace/page.do?pageID=342 The October Crisis]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;HISTOR!CA&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Retrieved 5 Oct 2010.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Born in Ireland and known by his friends as &amp;quot;Jasper&amp;quot;, during [[World War II]], Cross served with the [[British Army]] and fought for the liberation of [[France]]. In 1946 he was commissioned into the [[Royal Engineers]] Movement Control Section. After the war he joined the diplomatic service and eventually served as a [[Trade Commissioner]] in [[Canada]]; [[City of Halifax|Halifax]],  [[Nova Scotia]];  [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]; and [[Kuala Lumpur]], before becoming senior Trade Commissioner in [[Montreal, Quebec]].

Cross went on to serve as Under-Secretary in various divisions of the British Department of Trade and Industry and Department of Energy. In 1971, he was made a Companion of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG). His statements regarding the FLQ Crisis are included in [http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/archives/collections/BDOHP/Cross.pdf this taped interview.]

==Kidnapping==
On October 5, 1970, Cross was abducted at gunpoint from his British diplomatic residence at 1297 Redpath Crescent, in the [[Golden Square Mile]] district of Montreal, and held as a [[hostage]] for two months as the [[Front de libération du Québec|FLQ]] made a series of demands to the Quebec government.&amp;lt;ref name=kidnapping&amp;gt;[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1970/Canadian-Kidnappings%2C-Vietnam-trials/12303235577467-10/ &amp;quot;Canadian Kidnappings: 1970 Year in Review, UPI.com&amp;quot;]. Retrieved 5 Oct 2010.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was released on December 3 in exchange for safe passage for his abductors to [[Cuba]]. The talks were held at the Canada Pavilion, located on [[Île Notre-Dame]], the site of [[Expo &amp;apos;67]]. This site was declared Cuban territory for the period of the talks.&amp;lt;ref name=kidnapping /&amp;gt;

Six members of the FLQ&amp;apos;s [[liberation cell]] were later convicted of Cross&amp;apos;s kidnapping when they returned to Canada over time.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/terrorists/flq/index.html The October Crisis]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;truTV&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Retrieved 5 Oct 2010.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Cross said of his kidnapping:
&amp;quot;They told me about 10:00 o&amp;apos;clock on Wednesday evening that they had, the police knew where I was. Nothing much happened for about the next four hours. Then the power was cut at I think around 2:00 in the morning. I was in bed at the time; they got me up. They handcuffed me, they took me into a corridor in the middle of the house. They handcuffed me to a doorknob and I spent the night. It&amp;apos;s a very uncomfortable position.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=kidnapping /&amp;gt; On the 40th anniversary of the day that sparked the October Crisis, James Cross agreed to speak to CBC&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Current&amp;apos;&amp;apos; about the events surrounding his kidnapping.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2010/10/04/flq-anniversary.html &amp;apos;&amp;apos;AUDIO&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: CBC interviews FLQ kidnapping victim].
