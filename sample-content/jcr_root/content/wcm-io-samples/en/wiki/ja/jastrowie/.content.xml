&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jastrowie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-pl|j|a|s|&amp;apos;|t|r|o|w|J|e}} ({{lang-de|Jastrow}}) is a town in [[Poland]] of over 9,000 inhabitants in [[Zlotow County]], [[Greater Poland Voivodship]]. It has 8,900 inhabitants (1998) and lies on the edge of the [[Gwda River]] valley. The town is located on the [[Oska]] stream.

==History==

Jastrowie was one of the southernmost centres of the [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranians]]. In the beginning of the 14th century it belonged to the [[Ujscie|Ujście]] [[castellany]]. On May 5, 1602, the town received the [[city rights]] granted by Piotr Potulicki and confirmed by King [[Sigismund III Vasa]]. In the 17th century the town developed quickly. New inhabitants arrived, including Pomeranians, settlers from [[Scotland]], and [[Jew]]s.

After the [[Partitions of Poland]] the town was incorporated into [[Prussia]]. In 19th century Jastrowie (then called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jastrow&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[German language|German]]) became one of the most important centres of horse trade. During [[World War II]], Jastrowie was an important point of [[Pommerstellung]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wał Pomorski&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), one of the most important German lines of fortification in the East.

Currently Jastrowie is the site of several wood and bicycle factories. It was part of the [[Pila Voivodship|Piła Voivodship]] from 1975 until 1998, when the administrative region was superseded by the [[Greater Poland Voivodship]]. Jastrowie&amp;apos;s most important [[Culture|cultural]] event is its International Folk Festival, &amp;quot;Bukowińskie Spotkania&amp;quot;.
