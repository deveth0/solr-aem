&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jan Theuninck&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 7 June 1954), is a Belgian [[Painting|painter]] and [[poet]]. Although born in [[Zonnebeke]], [[Belgium]], and a native speaker of [[Dutch language|Dutch]], he writes in [[French language|French]] and occasionally [[English language|English]]. His painting is abstract, falling somewhere between [[minimalism]] and monochrome [[expressionism]].

As a painter, he has been influenced by [[Ellsworth Kelly]] and [[Joan MirÃ³]]. His work in both media is guided by his social and political convictions, dealing with topics such as [[colonialism]] old and new, mass and society, and [[pacifism]].
