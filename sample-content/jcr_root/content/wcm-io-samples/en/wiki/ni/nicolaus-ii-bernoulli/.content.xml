        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nicolaus II Bernoulli&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a.k.a. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Niklaus Bernoulli&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nikolaus Bernoulli&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (February 6, 1695, [[Basel]], [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]] – July 31, 1726, [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Imperial Russia|Russia]]) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]]  [[mathematician]] as were his father [[Johann Bernoulli]] and one of his brothers, [[Daniel Bernoulli]].  He was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the [[Bernoulli family]].

Nicolaus worked mostly on [[curve]]s, [[differential equation]]s, and [[probability]]. He was a friend and contemporary of [[Leonhard Euler]], who studied under Nicolaus&amp;apos; father.  He also contributed to [[fluid dynamics]].

He was older brother of [[Daniel Bernoulli]], to whom he also taught mathematics.  Even in his youth he had learned several languages. From the age of 13, he studied mathematics and law at the [[University of Basel]]. In 1711 he received his Master&amp;apos;s of Philosophy; in 1715 he received a Doctorate in Law. In 1716-17 he was a private tutor in [[Venice]]. From 1719 he had the Chair in Mathematics at the [[University of Padua]], as the successor of [[Giovanni Poleni]]. He served as an assistant to his father, among other areas, in the correspondence over the priority dispute between [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and also in the priority dispute between his father and the English mathematician [[Brook Taylor]]. In 1720 he posed the problem of reciprocal [[orthogonal trajectories]], which was intended as a challenge for the English Newtonians. From 1723 he was a law professor at the Berner Oberen Schule. In 1725 he together with his brother Daniel, with whom he was touring Italy and France at this time, was invited by [[Peter the Great]] to the newly founded [[St. Petersburg Academy]]. Eight months after his appointment he came down with a fever and died. His professorship was succeeded in 1727 by [[Leonhard Euler]], whom the Bernoulli brothers had recommended.  His early death cut short a promising career.
