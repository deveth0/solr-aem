Prince &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nikolai Sergeyevich Trubetzkoy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also Troubetskoy; [[Russian Language|Russian]]: {{Unicode|Никола́й Серге́евич Трубецко́й}}; [[Moscow]], April 16, 1890 – [[Vienna]], June 25, 1938) was a Russian [[linguistics|linguist]] and [[historian]] whose teachings formed a nucleus of the [[Prague School]] of [[structural linguistics]]. He is widely considered to be the founder of [[morphophonology]]. He was also associated with the Russian [[Eurasianists]].

==Life and career==
Trubetzkoy was born into an extremely refined environment. His father, [[Sergei Nikolaevich Trubetzkoy]], came from a [[Gediminid]] [[Trubetzkoy|princely family]]. Having graduated from the [[Moscow University]] (1913), Trubetzkoy delivered lectures there until the revolution. Thereafter he moved first to the university of [[Rostov-na-Donu]], then to the [[Sofia University|University of Sofia]] (1920–22), and finally took the chair of Professor of Slavic Philology at the [[University of Vienna]] (1922-1938). He died from a heart attack attributed to [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution following his publishing an article highly critical of [[Hitler]]&amp;apos;s theories.

Trubetzkoy&amp;apos;s chief contributions to linguistics lie in the domain of [[phonology]], in particular in analyses of the phonological systems of individual languages and in the search for general and universal phonological laws. His magnum opus, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grundzüge der Phonologie&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Principles of Phonology),&amp;lt;ref name=grundzuge&amp;gt;{{cite book | last = Trubetzkoy | first = Nikolai | title = Principles of phonology | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1969 | isbn = 0520015355 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was issued posthumously. In this book he famously defined the [[phoneme]] as the smallest distinctive unit within the structure of a given language. This work was crucial in establishing phonology as a discipline separate from [[phonetics]].

It is sometimes hard to distinguish Trubetzkoy&amp;apos;s views from those of his friend [[Roman Jakobson]], who should be credited with spreading the Prague School views on phonology after Trubetzkoy&amp;apos;s death.
