[[Image:Ltspkr.png]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Media:Nl-Nieuw-Lekkerland.ogg|Nieuw-Lekkerland]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (population: 9,539 in 2004) is a town and former municipality in the western [[Netherlands]], in the province of [[South Holland]]. It is situated on the southern shores of the [[Lek River]], in the north-western part of the [[Alblasserwaard]]. The former municipality covered an area of 12.77&amp;amp;nbsp;km² (of which 2.37&amp;amp;nbsp;km² was covered by water). Since 2013 Nieuw-Lekkerland has been a part of the new municipality of [[Molenwaard]].

The former municipality included the population centres of Nieuw-Lekkerland (divided into the two neighbourhoods Dorpslaan and Middelweg) and [[Kinderdijk]].

The town&amp;apos;s name evolved slightly over time: in 1280 Leckerlant, in 1331 Niewe Leckerland, and in 1903 Nieuw Lekkerland. It means &amp;quot;land of or near the river Lek&amp;quot; with the addition of &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;nieuw&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;new&amp;quot;) to distinguish it from Old Lekkerland (now [[Lekkerkerk]]) across the river.

==History==
The name Nieue-Leckelant appears for the first time around 1325 and distinguishes it from Oudt-Leckelant (now Lekkerkerk). The most notable building used to be Castle Schoonenburg. Because of its elevated location on a mount, it served as a refuge for the people during floods before the reclamation of the Alblasserwaard. After 1456, the castle was abandoned and became a ruin. Its remains were thereafter probably used to rebuild a church tower. only the mount is still visible. The [[Reformed Church (Nieuw-Lekkerland)|Reformed Church]] is from 1848.

Its economy was based on agriculture, cattle raising, and fishing. In the 19th century ship building and industry developed, resulting in an increasing population: from 770 in 1820, 1153 in 1840, 2000 in 1867, to 9400 in 2004.

Till 2013, Nieuw-Lekkerland was one of the few remaining municipalities in the Alblasserwaard that never merged with any other municipality.
