        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nesreen Barwari&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1967) was a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] official. She was born in [[Baghdad]] to a Kurdish family and was imprisoned at age fourteen due to her brother&amp;apos;s involvement with the Kurdish movement. She obtained a Bachelor of Science in architectural engineering at the [[University of Baghdad]] in 1991. She served with the [[United Nations]] local office in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] from 1991 to 1998 . After obtaining a [[master of public administration]] at the [[Harvard Kennedy School]] in 1999, she served as minister of reconstruction and development in [[KRG]] until 2003.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://globalpolitician.com/25202-iraq Women in the New Iraq], by Judith Colp Rubin, Global Politician, September 2008&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

She was appointed [[Iraq]]&amp;apos;s Minister for Municipalities &amp;amp; Public Works in September 2003, the only woman minister on the interim [[Iraqi Governing Council]].  In June 2004, she was reappointed minister in the [[Iraqi Transitional Government]]. In January 2005 she was elected to the [[Council of Representatives of Iraq|Iraq National Assembly]], but resigned her membership to continue as minister.

Berwari has displayed concern for the [[rights of women]] in Iraq. In January 2004, she joined protests against Resolution 137 of the Iraqi Governing Council that would have curtailed women&amp;apos;s rights by making Iraq&amp;apos;s personal status law subject to religious doctrine. During her time as minister in Baghdad she survived several assassination attempts.
