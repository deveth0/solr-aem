&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ninety Mile Beach&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Te Oneroa-a-Tōhē&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Māori language|Māori]]) is a beach located on the western coast of the [[Far North (district), New Zealand|far north]] of the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nine&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  It stretches from just west of [[Kaitaia]] towards [[Cape Reinga]] along the [[Aupouri Peninsula]].  It begins close to the headland of Reef Point, to the west of [[Ahipara Bay]], sweeping briefly northeast before turning northwest for the majority of its length.  It ends at Scott Point, five km south of [[Cape Maria van Diemen]].

== Etymology ==
The name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ninety Mile Beach&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a misnomer because it is actually 55 miles (88 km) long.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nine&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Several theories have been advanced for the name, the most common stemming from the days when missionaries travelled on horse back when on average a horse could travel {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1}} in a day before needing to be rested.  The beach took three days to travel therefore earning its name, but the missionaries did not take into account the slower pace of the horses walking in the sand, thus thinking they had travelled {{convert|90|mi|km}} when in fact they had only travelled 55.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The beach&amp;apos;s [[Māori people|Māori]] name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Te Oneroa-a-Tōhē&amp;apos;&amp;apos; will be officially recognised as part of the government&amp;apos;s [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements|Treaty settlement]] with [[Te Aupōuri]] [[iwi]], who will also take part in the management of the beach.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nine&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;amp;objectid=10781446 |title=Iwi deal to co-manage 90 Mile Beach |date=27 January 2012 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The beach, and specifically its northern dunes,  is a famous tourist destination.  The dunes, looking very much like a desert landscape, are an unexpected sight for travellers, especially if arriving from the landward side.  They are often used for [[bodyboarding]].

In 1932, Ninety Mile Beach was used as the [[runway]] for some of the earliest [[airmail]] services between Australia and New Zealand.  It is still sometimes used as an alternative road to [[State Highway 1 (New Zealand)|State Highway 1]] north of Kaitaia, though mainly for tourist reasons, or when the main road is closed due to landslides or floods.
