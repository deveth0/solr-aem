&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nikolaus, Count Luckner&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (12 January 1722, [[Cham in der Oberpfalz]] &amp;amp;ndash; 4 January 1794, [[Paris]]) was a German in French service who rose to become a [[Marshal of France]]. (His name is spelled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nicolas&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in French, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nikolaus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in German.)

Luckner grew up in [[Cham (district)|Cham]], in eastern [[Bavaria]] and received his early education from the Jesuits in [[Passau]]. Before entering the French service, Luckner had spent time in the Bavarian, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Hanover]]ian armies. He fought as a commander of [[hussar]]s during the [[Seven Years&amp;apos; War]] against the French. Luckner joined the French army in 1763 with the rank of lieutenant general. In 1784 he was made a [[Denmark|Danish]] count.

He supported the [[French Revolution]], and the year 1791 saw Luckner being made a Marshal of France. In 1792, Luckner first served as commander of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Army of the Rhine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, during which time [[Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle|Rouget de Lisle]] dedicated to him the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chant de Guerre pour l&amp;apos;Armée du Rhin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (War Song of the Army of the Rhine), which was to become better known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Marseillaise]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

As commander of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Army of the North&amp;apos;&amp;apos; he captured the [[Flanders|Flemish]] cities of [[Menen]] and [[Kortrijk]], but then had to retreat towards [[Lille]]. After the flight of [[Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] he was made generalissimo with orders to build a Reserve Army near [[Châlons-sur-Marne]]. However, the [[National Convention]] was not satisfied with his progress and [[Choderlos de Laclos]] was ordered to support or replace him. Luckner, now over 70 years of age, then asked for dismissal and went to [[Paris]].

He was arrested by the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] and sentenced to death. He died by the [[guillotine]] in Paris in 1794.

The [[carillon]] of the town hall in the [[Bavaria]]n town of [[Cham, Germany|Cham]] rings the Marseillaise every day at 12.05 p.m. to commemorate the city&amp;apos;s most famous son, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nikolaus Graf von Luckner&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

He was the great grandfather of Count [[Felix von Luckner]], a German World War I naval officer who commanded the famed merchant raider [[SMS Seeadler (Windjammer)|SMS Seeadler]].

He was owner of [[Krummbek Manor]].
