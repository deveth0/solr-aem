&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nicholson Street&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a street in inner [[Melbourne]]. It is named after [[William Nicholson (Australian politician)|William Nicholson]], then member of the [[Victorian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]], and later [[Premiers of Victoria|Premier of Victoria]] from 1859 to 1860.

==Geography==
Nicholson Street runs north-south through inner northern [[Melbourne]]. At its southernmost end, it connects to [[Spring Street, Melbourne|Spring Street]] near [[Bourke Street, Melbourne|Bourke Street]]. Between [[Victoria Street, Melbourne|Victoria Parade]] and Alexandra Parade, it forms the boundary between [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]] and [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]]; between Alexandra Parade and Brunswick Road, it forms the boundary between [[Carlton North, Victoria|Carlton North]] and [[Fitzroy North, Victoria|Fitzroy North]]; north of Brunswick Road, its remaining length is in [[Brunswick East, Victoria|Brunswick East]]. Nicholson Street merges into Albion Street, Brunswick East, just north of its intersection with Blyth Street.  [[Melbourne tram route 96|Tram route 96]], which enters Nicholson Street at the city end and terminates near Blyth Street, runs along virtually the entire length of the street.

Nicholson Street, Brunswick East, is often confused with nearby &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nicholson Street, [[Coburg, Victoria|Coburg]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which also runs north to south. Nicholson Street, Coburg, is a continuation of Holmes Street, which is itself a continuation of [[Lygon Street, Melbourne|Lygon Street]].

==Route==

Nicholson Street runs from Spring Street in the city, and heads in a north-northeasterly direction for approximately 5&amp;amp;nbsp;km, before it runs through a series of 3 bends for 500m before merging into Albion Street in Brunswick East, to the north.

==History==
[[Image:Nicholson Street by night.jpg|thumb|right|300px]]
Nicholson Street was built in 1854 to provide a road from Melbourne to the stone quarries of [[Brunswick East, Victoria|Brunswick East]]. It initially ended at Brunswick Road. Residents to the north of Brunswick Road had to travel west to [[Sydney Road, Melbourne|Sydney Road]] in order to travel into Melbourne, adding several miles to the journey. These residents began a public campaign to have Nicholson Street extended to the north. Two land owners sold their land at inflated prices in order for the extension to go ahead, which happened in 1868.

==Landmarks==

Just to the north lie the [[Royal Exhibition Building]] and the [[Melbourne Museum]], both in [[Carlton Gardens, Melbourne|Carlton Gardens]], and [[St Vincent&amp;apos;s Hospital, Melbourne|St Vincent&amp;apos;s Hospital]].  Further north in Brunswick East, at the corner of Blyth Street, Melbourne alternative radio station [[3RRR]] makes its home.&amp;lt;ref name=rrr&amp;gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/rated-r/2006/11/22/1163871477181.html], 3RRR History.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
