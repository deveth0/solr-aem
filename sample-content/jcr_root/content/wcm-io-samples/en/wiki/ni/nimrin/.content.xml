&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nimrin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arab]] town of 320 that was captured and depopulated by [[Israel]] during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]].

==History==
Nimrin stood on the site of Kfar Nimra when [[Palestine]] was ruled by the [[Roman Empire]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Khalidi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Khalidi, 1992, p.535&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Its inhabitants were [[Jew]]s when [[Saint Peter]] and [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] visited the town in 30 CE.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Murray, 1997, p.165.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Nimrin was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the sixteenth century CE, and by 1596 the village was had a population of 110 under the administration of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[nahiya]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;subdistrict&amp;quot;) of [[Tiberias]], part of Sanjak [[Safad]]. It paid taxes on wheat barley, wheat, olives, beehives, and goats.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Hütteroth, Wolf-Dieter and Kamal Abdulfattah (1977), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband 5. Erlangen, Germany: Vorstand der Fränkischen Geographischen Gesellschaft. p. 189. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 535&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In the nineteenth century, Nimrin grew to become a stone-built village of 250 [[Muslim]] people. It was described as being built on the slope of a hill, surrounded by arable land.&amp;lt;ref name=SWP361&amp;gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP, Vol. I, [http://www.archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/361/mode/1up p.361]. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 535&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The Ottomans founded an elementary school in the village.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Khalidi&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

In 1922, Nimrin became a part of the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] and its entire population of 316 in 1931 was [[Muslim]]. The main economic sectors were farming and livestock, with grain being the most important crop, followed by vegetables. The Ottoman school was closed down.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Khalidi&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
===1948 war, and aftermath===
During the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], Nimrin fell into [[Israel]]i hands on July 17, 1948 after nearby [[Lubya]] was captured at the end of [[Operation Dekel]]. Its entire population of 320 (1945) fled for unclear reasons. According to [[Walid Khalidi]], &amp;quot;the site and a major part of the lands are surrounded by a fence.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Khalidi&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
