&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nijverdal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a town of approximately 25.000 inhabitants in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] province of [[Overijssel]]. It is the commercial centre of the municipality [[Hellendoorn]].

Nijverdal (which means &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Industrious Valley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was founded in 1836 on the territory of the hamlet Noetsele. It was here that the [[industrial revolution]] in the Netherlands took root. [[Thomas Ainsworth]] (1795-1841) was one of its &amp;apos;&amp;apos;founding fathers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Textile production was the focus of industrial activity in Nijverdal, as it was for the rest of the [[Twente]] region. Some of the traditional factory buildings in the [[Art Deco]] or [[Jugendstil]] style still remain.

A small river called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Regge (river)|Regge]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; runs through the town.

==History==
Before world war II Nijverdal had a small [[history of the Jews in the Netherlands|Jewish]] community. The municipal seat of the area, Hellendoorn, had a small synagogue and Jewish cemetery. The synagogue still exists as a storage shed behind one of the houses in the village, and the cemetery is no longer in use. It has about 20 graves, most from the nineteenth century and early 20th century. The municipality maintains the cemetery and protects it from vandalism.

The Jewish community was essentially erased by the [[Holocaust]]. Most of its members perished in [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]] and [[Auschwitz]].

On March, 22nd 1945, Nijverdal was severely bombed by allied bombers who were going after the German Reichskommissar of Austrian origine [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]]. Seyss-Inquart was fleeing the advancing Allied forces and had set up his temporary headquarters in the Reformed School in Nijverdal, but had already left town at the time of the bombing. Over 70 people were killed, mainly at de Grotestraat.

In 1955, part of the municipality of Wierden was annexed (Eversberg, Konijnenbelt, Slettenhaar and Lochter) which is the only part of the municipality located on originally Twente soil. In the late 70&amp;apos;s the quarter of &amp;apos;Groot Lochter&amp;apos; arose here.

==Transportation==

* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Railway station&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: [[Nijverdal railway station|Nijverdal]]

From 1 December 2009 until 2013 a second temporary railway station is open: [[Nijverdal West railway station|Nijverdal West]]. This is due to major improvements to the road and rail in Nijverdal. During this time Nijverdal is split in two because of a 750 m traffic tunnel that is being built. Only one traffic bridge, one pedestrian/bike bridge and one small tunnel connect the north side to the south side.

Services to [[Zwolle]] depart from &amp;apos;Nijverdal West&amp;apos;, and services to [[Almelo]], [[Hengelo]] and [[Enschede]] depart from &amp;apos;Nijverdal&amp;apos;.

== Sports ==
Nijverdal has a good Water polo club, named [[ZPC Het Ravijn|Het Ravijn]], of which both men and women teams play in the Dutch Premier League. Some of the woman in the women team play for the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] team, which won gold at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].
