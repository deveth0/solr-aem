&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nikolaev&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Impact crater|crater]] on the [[Far side of the Moon|far side]] of the [[Moon]]. It is located north of the [[Mare Moscoviense]] and south of the larger crater [[Von Neumann (crater)|Von Neumann]]. Because it is on the far side of the Moon, it is not visible from [[Earth]].

The circular rim of this crater is not overlain by any significant craters but has been slightly eroded. It has an uneven edge and a wide inner wall. There is a shelf running around much of the wide inner edge where the material has slumped, and some [[wiktionary:terrace|terracing]] along the northeastern side. The interior floor is rugged in places, particularly in the eastern half, and is marked by several small impacts in the southern half. There is a small central rise near the midpoint.
