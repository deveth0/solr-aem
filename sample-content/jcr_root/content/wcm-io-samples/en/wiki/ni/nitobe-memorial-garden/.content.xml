The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nitobe Memorial Garden&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 2½ acre (one hectare) traditional [[Japanese garden]] located at the [[University of British Columbia]], just outside the city limits of [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]]. It is part of the [[UBC Botanical Garden and Centre for Plant Research]].
[[File:Nitobe Gardens, memorial.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial]]
One of the most authentic Japanese gardens in North America,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nitobe.org/]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; it honours Japanese author, educator, diplomat, and politician [[Nitobe Inazo|Nitobe Inazō]] (1862–1933), who died in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] (now the sister city of Nitobe&amp;apos;s home town [[Morioka]]), and whose goal was &amp;quot;to become a bridge across the Pacific.&amp;quot;

The garden has been the subject of more than fifteen years&amp;apos; study by a UBC professor, who believes that its construction hides a number of impressive features, including references to Japanese philosophy and mythology, shadow bridges visible only at certain times of year, and positioning of a lantern that is filled with light at the exact date and time of Nitobe&amp;apos;s death each year. The garden is behind the university&amp;apos;s Asian Centre, which is built with steel girders from Japan&amp;apos;s exhibit at [[Expo &amp;apos;70|Osaka Expo]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.library.ubc.ca/home/lib-history.html]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Features==
The Garden features a fully functional [[Japanese tea house]] called Ichibō-an, surrounded by an outer [[Roji|roji tea garden]] with a waiting bench and an inner garden.

The Garden also features several [[Japanese lantern|lanterns]] of different varieties, including a snow viewing lantern, and the Nitobe Lantern, featuring carvings of lotus blossoms and a dog (Nitobe&amp;apos;s birth sign), and the inscription &amp;quot;I.M., Inazo Nitobe, 1861–1933, Apostle of Goodwill Among Nations, Erected by his friends.”&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nitobe.org/lanterns.php]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Another feature of the garden is its pond, which supports a small ecosystem of fish as well as some water skimming insects.
