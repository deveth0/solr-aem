&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;T. Nicolaus Tideman&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|iː|d|ɨ|m|ən}}, not {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aɪ|d|m|ən}}; born August 11, 1943 in [[Chicago, Illinois]]) is a [[Professor]] of [[Economics]] at [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]]. He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in economics and [[mathematics]] from [[Reed College]] in 1965 and his [[PhD]] in economics from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1969. Tideman was an Assistant Professor of Economics at [[Harvard University]] from 1969-1973, during which time from 1970-1971 he was a Senior Staff Economist for the President&amp;apos;s [[Council of Economic Advisors]].  Since 1973 he has been at Virginia Tech, with various visiting positions at Harvard&amp;apos;s [[Kennedy School of Government]] (1979-1980), [[University of Buckingham]] (1985-1986), and the [[American Institute for Economic Research]] (1999-2000).

== Research ==

Tideman&amp;apos;s academic interests include [[Land value taxation|taxation of land]], [[voting theory]], and [[political philosophy]]. In 1987, he devised the [[voting system]] called [[ranked pairs]], which is a [[Condorcet method]], and in 2000 the [[CPO-STV]] proportional voting method. Tideman also devised the [[independence of clones criterion]] which both of his methods satisfy. He is an associate of the [[Earth Rights Institute]].  His book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Collective Decisions and Voting: The Potential for Public Choice&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was published by Ashgate Publishing in November 2006.
