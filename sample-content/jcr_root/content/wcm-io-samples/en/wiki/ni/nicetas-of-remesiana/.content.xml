        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Saint Nicetas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ca. 335&amp;amp;ndash;414) was [[Bishop]] of  [[Remesiana]], present-day [[Bela Palanka]] in the [[Pirot District]] of modern [[Serbia]], but which was then in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Dacia Mediterranea]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20000720_unione-romania-roma_en.html Letter of Pope John Paul II] for the third centenary of the union of the Greek-Catholic Church of Romania with the Church of Rome&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Biography==
There have been a lot of speculations about Nicetas&amp;apos; origin. Some theories exist he was born a Greek or [[Dacians|Dacian]]/[[Slavs|Slav]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9055708/Nicetas-Of-Remesiana Encyclopaedia Britannica]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.bvau.ro/docs/doc_eng.htm The Romanian People - Continuer of the European Neolithic Civilization]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; However, his name does not give us any clue as it could be a slave&amp;apos;s name given to a member of any ethnical background by his Roman master. Nothing specific is known about his life, but on the basis of a bibliography given by [[Gennadius of Massilia]] in his book about famous men (22,13) there have been an important number of attempts to reconstitute Nicetas&amp;apos; work.  Thus, it is believed by some authors he promoted [[Latin]] sacred music for use during [[Mass (liturgy)|the eucharistic worship]] and composed a number of liturgical hymns, among which some twentieth-century scholars number the major Latin  [[Christian]] [[hymn]] of praise, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Te Deum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, traditionally attributed to Saints [[Ambrose]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].

Because of his missionary activity, his contemporary and friend, Saint [[Paulinus of Nola]] lauded him poetically for instructing in the Gospel barbarians changed by him from wolves to sheep and brought into the fold of peace, and for teaching to sing of Christ with a Roman heart bandits who previously had no such ability.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;quod barbaros oves factos Evangelium edocuisset atque in pacis aulam duxisset et quondam inperiti ac latrones Christum corde romano resonare didicisset&amp;quot; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Martyrologium Romanum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001. ISBN 88-209-7210-7, p. 330).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; However, it is doubtful, whether these barbarians really were barbarians, or whether their mention is only a poetical topos. Indeed, Paulin, who wrote a quite classical Latin poetry, probably used existing poetical authorities. For Dacia, where Nicetas was from, the poetical authority was [[Ovid]], although the Dacia (probably the province Dacia mediterranea) of that time did not correspond with the Getia where Ovid had been banished to.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Philippe Blasen, “Nicetas of Remesiana – A Missionary Bishop in Dacia?” in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Studia Universitatis Babeș-Bolyai Theologia catholica&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1-2, 2012, 39-49&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Lengthy excerpts survive of his principal doctrinal work, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Instructions for Candidates for Baptism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in six books. They show that he stressed the orthodox position in Trinitarian doctrine. They contain the expression &amp;quot;[[communion of saints]]&amp;quot; in reference to the belief in a mystical bond uniting both the living and the dead in a confirmed hope and love. No evidence survives of previous use of this expression, which has since played a central role in formulations of the Christian creed.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

His [[feast day]] as a [[saint]] is on [[22 June]], the day on which Saint Paulinus of Nola also is celebrated.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Martyrologium Romanum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

ISBN 1-55570-045-4.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
