        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nigel Edward Buxton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1924) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] travel writer and wine critic, also known for appearing as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;BaaadDad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the [[Channel 4]] comedy series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Adam and Joe Show]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was written and presented by his son [[Adam Buxton]] along with Adam&amp;apos;s friend [[Joe Cornish (entertainer)|Joe Cornish]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/jan/24/tvandradio.television1 TV and Radio: The Adam and Joe show | Culture | The Guardian]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The comedy behind the character of BaaadDad is the juxtaposition of the fact that he is clearly an [[elderly]] and [[upper middle class]] man with the topics that he discusses, which relate to [[youth culture]] - [[nightclub|clubbing]], [[recreational drug use|drug use]], and so on.  In this character, he featured in the video for [[Frank Black]]&amp;apos;s single Dog Gone.

Buxton has a Twitter account and tweets as @baaaddad and blogs at baaaddad.wordpress.com

&amp;quot;Walking in Wine Country&amp;quot; was published by Weidenfeld and Nicholson in 1993
