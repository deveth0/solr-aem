&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nic Endo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born January 7, 1976) is a [[Japan]]ese-[[Germany|German]]-[[United States|American]] [[noise music]]ian who plays with the German [[digital hardcore]] group [[Atari Teenage Riot]]. The daughter of a Japanese mother and a German father, Endo was born in [[Wichita Falls]], [[Texas]], [[United States|US]].

==Background==
Endo lived in [[Frankfurt]] from 1994 to 1996 and later moved to [[Berlin]]. Nic Endo joined ATR while they were on tour in 1997 and was involved with the production of their final album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[60 Second Wipe Out]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

After ATR effectively broke-up in 2000, Endo released an experimental solo album entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Cold Metal Perfection]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Released by [[Fatal Recordings]], an explicitly [[feminist]] offshoot of [[Digital Hardcore Recordings]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cold Metal Perfection&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was named as one of the top 20 albums of 2001 by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 2001, Endo assisted in the production of [[Alec Empire]]&amp;apos;s solo album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Intelligence and Sacrifice]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. She has also since been a part of Empire&amp;apos;s touring band, and was also involved with his follow-up album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Futurist&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2005). In 2010 ATR reformed and Endo has taken Hanin Elias&amp;apos;s slot as the female vocalist in ATR. Her trademark is her black leather and white face paint overlaid by the characters 抵抗, meaning &amp;quot;resistance&amp;quot;.
