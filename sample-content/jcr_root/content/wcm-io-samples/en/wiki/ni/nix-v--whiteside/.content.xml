&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nix v. Whiteside&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Case citation|475 U.S. 157]] (1986) was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision that dealt with the [[Ineffective assistance of counsel|effective assistance of counsel]] during a criminal trial.

==Background==
Before his trial for murder, the defendant, Whiteside, discussed his planned testimony with his attorney, and said that he had seen &amp;quot;something metallic in [the victim&amp;apos;s] hand&amp;quot;, in contradiction to earlier statements that he had not seen a gun in the victim&amp;apos;s hand.  Whiteside&amp;apos;s attorney, Robinson, had warned that he (Robinson) would have an ethical obligation to report perjured testimony to the court.  Whiteside, on the stand, admitted that while he believed the victim had a gun, he did not actually see a gun in the victim&amp;apos;s hand.  Whiteside was convicted, and subsequently applied for a Federal writ of [[habeas corpus]], on the grounds that his conviction was tainted under the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] in that his attorney&amp;apos;s threat to disclose the perjury had deprived him, Whiteside, of effective assistance of counsel.

==Supreme Court decision==
The court ruled unanimously that Whiteside had not been deprived of his Sixth Amendment rights.  The majority opinion, written by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren Burger|Burger]], stated that an attorney&amp;apos;s duty to his client&amp;apos;s cause is &amp;quot;limited to legitimate, lawful conduct compatible with the very nature of a trial as a search for truth&amp;quot;; and that &amp;quot;the right to counsel includes no right to have a lawyer who will cooperate with planned perjury&amp;quot;.

[[Concurring opinion|Concurrences]] by [[Harry Blackmun|Blackmun]], [[William Joseph Brennan|Brennan]] and [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]] stated that Whiteside had failed to show that the attorney&amp;apos;s actions had caused prejudice to the defendant&amp;apos;s trial required to sustain a claim of &amp;quot;ineffective representation&amp;quot;, as required by the case of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Strickland v. Washington]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).

In a separate concurrence, [[William Joseph Brennan|Brennan]] said that the Court is deciding only the narrow issue &amp;quot;conduct acceptable under the Sixth Amendment&amp;quot; (quoting the lower court). &amp;quot;Unfortunately, the Court seems unable to resist the temptation of sharing with the legal community its vision of ethical conduct.&amp;quot; But it is up to &amp;quot;the States... how [lawyers] behave in their courts, unless and until federal rights are violated.&amp;quot;
