&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nitmiluk National Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is in the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]], 244&amp;amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], around a series of gorges on the [[Katherine River]] and [[Edith Falls]]. Previously named Katherine Gorge National Park, its northern edge borders [[Kakadu National Park]]. The gorges and the surrounding landscape have great ceremonial significance to the local [[Jawoyn]] people, who are custodians of Nitmiluk National Park.  In [[Jawoyn language|Jawoyn]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nitmiluk&amp;apos;&amp;apos; means &amp;quot;place of the [[cicada]] [[Dreaming (spirituality)|dreaming]]&amp;quot;.

==Facilities==
The gorges can be explored by canoe and flat bottomed boat.  In the dry season the gorges become separated as the level of the river falls.  They are interconnected in the wet.  There is a visitor centre located at the Katherine Gorge, about 30&amp;amp;nbsp;km east of the town of [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]]. Information displays are set up that explain the geology, landscape and aboriginal history of the National Park.  Tours can be booked at the centre or at the visitor centre in the town.

==Katherine Gorge==
Katherine Gorge, a deep gorge carved through ancient sandstone by the Katherine River, is the central attraction of the park. Katherine Gorge is made up of thirteen gorges, with rapids and falls, and follow the Katherine River, which begins in Kakadu.  During the Dry, roughly from April to October, the Katherine Gorge waters are placid in most spots and ideal for swimming and canoeing. There may be [[freshwater crocodile]]s in most parts of the river, as they nest along the banks, but they are harmless to humans. [[Saltwater crocodile]]s regularly enter the river during the [[wet season]], when the water levels are very high, and are subsequently removed and returned to the lower levels at the onset of the [[dry season]]. Thus, swimming in the wet season is prohibited. Cruises of various lengths go as far as the fifth gorge.

== Wildlife ==
[[Freshwater Crocodile]]s are widely distributed along the river year-round. During the wet season, rises in water levels may allow [[Saltwater Crocodile]]s to enter the gorge, where they are caught and relocated to lower levels when the dry season begins.  Birds that can be seen include [[Osprey]]s, [[Red-tailed Black Cockatoo]]s, [[Great Bowerbird]]s, [[White-gaped Honeyeater]]s and [[Red-winged Parrot]]s.  Part of the [[Yinberrie Hills Important Bird Area]], identified as such by [[BirdLife International]] because of its importance for [[endangered species|endangered]] [[Gouldian Finch]]es, lies in the park.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;BirdLife International.
