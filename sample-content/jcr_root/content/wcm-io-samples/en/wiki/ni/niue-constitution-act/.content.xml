        text="&lt;p&gt;{{Politics of Niue}}
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Schedules&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Niue Constitution Act 1974&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; form the Niue [[constitution]]. It stipulates the make-up of the [[executive branch]] of the government, the [[legislative branch]], and the [[judicial branch]].  The Niue Constitution Act 1974 is the supreme law of [[Niue]]; any other Niue law that is inconsistent with the Niue Constitution Act 1974 will be deemed to be invalid.

Its granting by the [[New Zealand]] [[Parliament of New Zealand|Parliament]] in 1974 is celebrated yearly as Niue&amp;apos;s independence on &amp;quot;[[Constitution Day]]&amp;quot; on 19 October.  The road towards self-government for Niue started with the [[Special Committee on Decolonization|UN Decolonisation Committee]] putting pressure on New Zealand for Niue to decide what form of status Niue wanted.  The people of Niue voted in 1974 choosing the self-government option as the best direction for Niue.  The Niue Constitution is the legal doctrine that put the wishes of the Niue people for self-government into practice.  Self-government means Pule Fakamotu meaning for Niueans to lead and take charge of their own affairs; this has reduced the number of New Zealand expats working in key Government positions from around 20 in 1974 to none at the moment.

The Niue Constitution requires 2/3 majority in the three readings in the Legislative Assembly and also requires 2/3 support from the electors before it can be amended.  There is a select committee that have been working on reviewing the constitution but have made little progress, which is normal when dealing with a complex document like this.
