In [[politics of mexico|Mexican system of government]], an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ejido&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-es|eˈxiðo}}, from [[latin]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;exitum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is an area of [[communal land]] used for [[agriculture]], on which community members individually possess and farm a specific [[land lot|parcel]].  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ejidos&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are registered with Mexico&amp;apos;s National Agrarian Registry (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Registro Agrario Nacional&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).
The system of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ejidos&amp;apos;&amp;apos; dates from the [[Aztec]]s&amp;apos; rule of [[Mexico]]{{fact|date=May 2013}}. During the colonization of Mexico by the Spanish and other European settlers, the Spanish &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[encomienda]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; system replaced the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ejidos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{fact|date=May 2013}}.

==History and rationale==
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;encomienda&amp;apos;&amp;apos; system was abolished by the [[Mexican Constitution of 1917|Constitution of 1917]], with the promise of restoring the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ejido&amp;apos;&amp;apos; system. The system was reinitiated after the [[Mexican Revolution]] in some states, notably [[Morelos]] but the repartition of land in most of Mexico did not begin until [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] became president in 1934. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ejido&amp;apos;&amp;apos; system was introduced as an important component of the [[land reform]] program.  The typical procedure for the establishment of an ejido involved the following steps:
# landless farmers who leased lands from wealthy landlords would petition the federal government for the creation of an ejido in their general area;
#the federal government would consult with the landlord;
#the land would be expropriated from the landlords if the government approved the ejido; and
#an ejido would be established and the original petitioners would be designated as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ejidatarios&amp;apos;&amp;apos; with certain cultivation/use rights.
Ejidatarios did not actually own the land, but were allowed to use their alloted parcels indefinitely as long as they did not fail to use the land for more than two years.  They could even pass their rights on to their children.

==Reform and decline==
In 1991, President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] eliminated the constitutional right to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ejidos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, citing the &amp;quot;low productivity&amp;quot; of communally owned land.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedfel/y1992ioct2n92-34.html Ejido reform and the NAFTA&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The change came about largely as a result of the negotiation of NAFTA, the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], which came into operation in 1994.
