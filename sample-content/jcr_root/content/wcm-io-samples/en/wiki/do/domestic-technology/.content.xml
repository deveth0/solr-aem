        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Domestic technology&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the incorporation of applied science into the home.  There are many aspects of domestic technology.  On one level, there are [[home appliance]]s, [[home automation]] and other devices commonly used in the home, such as [[clothes dryer]]s and [[washing machine]]s.  These things are itemized below.  On another level, domestic technology recognizes the use of applied science to construct homes to achieve a particular goal, such as energy efficiency or self-sufficiency.  For more information, read about [[self-sufficient homes]].  It has been claimed that domestic technology has led to decreases in the time people spend on household work, although the factual basis of this claim is disputed (Bittman et al., 2004).
