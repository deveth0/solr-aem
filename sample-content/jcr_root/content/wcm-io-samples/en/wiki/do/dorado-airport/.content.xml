&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dorado Airport&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dorado Beach Airport&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{Airport codes|DDP}}&amp;lt;ref name=GCM /&amp;gt; was a small single runway airport in [[Dorado, Puerto Rico|Dorado]], [[Puerto Rico]].

[[Clara Livingston]], at the time owner of the property, ordered the strip to be built, and her friend, [[Amelia Earhart]], may have used the facility as well.&amp;lt;ref name=Spaced /&amp;gt; Later on, the [[United States]] military, during [[World War II]], paved the runway.&amp;lt;ref name=Freeman /&amp;gt;

Much later on, a large airline named [[Caribair (Puerto Rico)|Caribair]] (later overtaken by [[Eastern Air Lines]]), began flights there. When Caribair became part of Eastern, flights to Dorado Airport were suspended.

During the early 1980s, Dorado was served by [[Dorado Wings]], a small airline that operated commuter flights between Dorado Airport and [[Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. The airline operated propeller airplanes.

In the early 1990s, the airport was officially closed. In 1996, the parcel was rezoned and construction commenced of a master planned community: Dorado Beach East. In memory of Dorado Airport and its founder, Ms. Clara Livingston, the developers built a children&amp;apos;s playground themed with unique play airplanes, a hangar for activities, and a runway plaza.
