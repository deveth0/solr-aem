        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dobri Hristov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-bg|Добри Христов}}; 14 December 1875 – 23 January 1941) was one of the major [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] [[composer]]s of the 20th century. He wrote mainly [[choir|choral]] [[music]], as well as some [[church music]] and music for the [[orchestra]].

Hristov was born in [[Varna]], [[Bulgaria]]. He graduated from the [[Prague Conservatory]] in 1903 (under the directorship of the famous [[Czech people|Czech]] composer [[Antonín Dvořák]]). He returned to Bulgaria and helped with the development of Bulgarian music [[culture]], using lots of Bulgarian [[folklore]] elements in his compositions. He was conductor of [http://www.thesevensaints.com &amp;quot;The Seven Saints&amp;quot;] [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] and choir in the church of the same name in [[Sofia]], Bulgaria between 1911 and 1928. He died in [[Sofia]] in 1941 at age 65.
