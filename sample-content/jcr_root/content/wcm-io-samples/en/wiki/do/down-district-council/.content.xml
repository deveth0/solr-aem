&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Down District Council&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a Local Council in [[County Down]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. The Council is headquartered in [[Downpatrick]]. Other towns in the Council area are [[Ardglass]], [[Ballynahinch, County Down|Ballynahinch]], [[Castlewellan]], [[Clough]], [[Crossgar]], [[Dundrum, County Down|Dundrum]], [[Killough]], [[Killyleagh]], [[Newcastle, County Down|Newcastle]], [[Saintfield]], [[Seaforde]] and [[Strangford]]. It covers a population of nearly 64,000.

The Down District Council area consists of 4 electoral areas: Ballynahinch, Downpatrick, Newcastle and Rowallane. At the last election in 2011, 23 Councillors were elected from the following political parties: 9 [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]], 5 [[Sinn Féin]], 3 [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]], 3 [[Ulster Unionist Party|UUP]], 1 [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]], 1 [[Green Party in Northern Ireland|Green Party]], 1 [[Independent (politician)|Independent]]. The Council Chairman for the 2011/2012 council term is Councillor Dermot Curran (SDLP) and the Vice Chair is Councillor Liam Johnston (Sinn Féin).

In elections for the [[Westminster Parliament]] it is split between the [[Strangford (UK Parliament constituency)|Strangford constituency]] and the [[South Down (UK Parliament constituency)|South Down constituency]].

==Work of the Council==
The Council has periodically had to provide funding to ensure that the [[Saint Patrick Visitor Centre]] in [[Downpatrick]] remains in operation. It has also funded a major promenade infrastructure regeneration in [[Newcastle, County Down|Newcastle]]. The new promenade has won a number of National awards including a [[Civic Trust Awards|Civic Trust]] Award for Excellence in the Public Realm.

==Review of Public Administration==
Under the Review of Public Administration (RPA) the Council was due to merge with [[Newry and Mourne District Council]] in 2011 to form a single council for the enlarged area totalling 1539&amp;amp;nbsp;km² and a population of 150,886.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | title=Minister Foster announces decisions on Local Government Reform | work=DoE | url=http://www.doeni.gov.uk/index/local_government/minister_foster_announces_decisions_on_local_government_reform.htm | accessdate=2008-05-31}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The first election to the new council was due to take place in May 2009, but on 25 April 2008, [[Shaun Woodward]], [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] announced that the scheduled 2009 district council elections were to be postponed until the introduction of the eleven new councils in 2011.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7367253.stm &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Northern Ireland elections are postponed&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, BBC News, April 25, 2008, accessed April 27, 2008]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The planned change was abandoned in 2010 and the most recent election took place in May 2011 under the existing boundaries.
