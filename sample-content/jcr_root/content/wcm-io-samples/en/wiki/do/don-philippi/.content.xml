        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Don Philippi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (October 2, 1930 – January 26, 1993) was a noted translator of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Ainu language|Ainu]] and a musician.

Born in Los Angeles, Philippi studied at the [[University of Southern California]] before going to Japan in 1957 on a [[Fulbright scholarship]] to study at the [[Kokugakuin University]]. In Japan he became an expert in [[classical Japanese]] and Ainu.

Philippi is known for his translation of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Kojiki]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the ancient Shinto prayers known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[norito]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He also published a book of Ainu epic poetry ([[yukar]]) called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Songs of Gods, Songs of Humans: The Epic Tradition of the Ainu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and a book of ancient Japanese poetry called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;This Wine of Peace, This Wine of Laughter: A Complete Anthology of Japan&amp;apos;s Earliest Songs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Philippi was a noted technical translator.

Philippi published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Maratto&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a [[little magazine]] focused on Ainu literature and culture. The first issue was published March 3, 1977 in San Francisco, under the pseudonym Slava Ranko.

Philippi was also a musician, learning the shamisen and the biwa both in the U.S. and Japan. In the late 70s, he became a part of the San Francisco musical scene under the name of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Slava Ranko&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, performing a combination of Japanese biwa and synthesizer music. In 1981 he issued an album titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arctic Hysteria&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
