The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] YOA-5&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[Amphibious aircraft]] designed for the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. Although a prototype was built, it did not enter production.

==Design and development==
In November 1932, the U.S. Army ordered the development of an [[amphibious aircraft|amphibious]] reconnaissance aircraft/bomber, intended to act as navigation leaders and rescue aircraft for formations of conventional bombers. The resultant aircraft, which was ordered under the bomber designation &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;YB-11&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was designed in parallel with the similar but larger [[Douglas XP3D]] patrol [[flying boat]] for the [[United States Navy]]. It was a high-winged [[monoplane]] with two [[Wright R-1820 Cyclone]] [[radial engine]]s mounted in individual nacelles above the wing, resembling an enlarged version of the [[Douglas Dolphin]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Fran p192&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Prior to it being completed, it was first redesignated as an observation aircraft &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;YO-44&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and then the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;YOA-5&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;observation amphibian model 5&amp;apos;. It first flew during January 1935, and was delivered to the army during February that year.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Fran p192&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Francillon 1979, p.192.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The concept for which it was designed proved impracticable, and no further production ensued, but the YOA-5 was used to set two world distance records for amphibians, being finally scrapped in December 1943.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Fran p192-3&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Francillon 1979, pp. 192—193.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
