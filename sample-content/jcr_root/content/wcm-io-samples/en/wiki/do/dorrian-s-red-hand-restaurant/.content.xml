        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dorrian&amp;apos;s Red Hand&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known simply as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dorrian&amp;apos;s&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a famed [[Irish-American]] [[bar (establishment)|bar]] located at 1616 Second Avenue at East 84th Street, on the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], [[New York]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=_vCG1Uh_xh8C&amp;amp;q=Dorrian%27s+Red+Hand&amp;amp;dq=Dorrian%27s+Red+Hand&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=Oh_zTbSUIsu5tgfG-YiRBw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=7&amp;amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBg Dorrian&amp;apos;s entry], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shecky&amp;apos;s 2004 Bar Club &amp;amp; Lounge Guide New York&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Sheckys Media Inc, 2003).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Started by Irish immigrant James &amp;quot;Red Dog&amp;quot; Dorrian in 1960 and operated by his son Jack, the popular hangout became a social pillar for [[preppy]] Upper East Side teenagers, college students, and [[Yuppie|young urban professionals]]. It is known for its &amp;quot;old time&amp;quot; atmosphere and the chummy and clubby demeanor of its patrons. Many, if not most, patrons are regulars.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Today, the bar is still family-owned and managed by Jack Dorrian&amp;apos;s son, Jimmy. Dorrian&amp;apos;s has expanded to a second location in [[Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]]. Dorrian&amp;apos;s Red Hand is a common hang out for the players of the [[New York Yankees]].

== Dress code ==
Dorrian&amp;apos;s requires its patrons to adhere to a strict dress code. Men are required to wear collared shirts, and sneakers are generally frowned upon. Even the bartenders, staff, and doormen are required to dress in khaki pants and [[button-down shirt]]s.

== Role in &amp;quot;Preppie Murder&amp;quot; ==
On the night of August 25, 1986, [[Robert Chambers (killer)|Robert Chambers]] was socializing at what was then called Dorrian&amp;apos;s Red Hand with then girlfriend [[Alex Kapp Horner|Alex Kapp]]. That night, Kapp broke up with Chambers, apparently due to the presence of Chambers&amp;apos; ex-girlfriend, [[Jennifer Levin]]. Chambers later left the bar with Levin and her dead body was found the next morning. The name &amp;quot;Dorrian&amp;apos;s Red Hand&amp;quot; was subsequently truncated to &amp;quot;Dorrian&amp;apos;s&amp;quot; due to the obvious negative connotations of &amp;quot;Red Hand&amp;quot; following the Levin murder.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== In popular culture ==
Dorrian&amp;apos;s has served as a filming location for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[U.S. Marshals (film)|U.S. Marshalls]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Deli]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and episodes of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]], and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Gallery Girls]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
