&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Don Pedro&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Prince of Aragon is a fictional character from [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare&amp;apos;s]] play &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Much Ado About Nothing]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In the play, Don Pedro visits his friend Leonato in [[Messina, Italy]] while coming back from war. He also helps bring together one of the play&amp;apos;s major couples, Beatrice and Benedick. His brother, John the Bastard, is jealous of Don Pedro and plots to ruin his best friend, Claudio&amp;apos;s wedding. Don Pedro is considered a character that is the middleman in the story and seems to understand the events more than the other character, however Don Pedro also experiences some [[dramatic irony]]. For example, Don Pedro does not know that it is Don John who ruins the wedding until his henchman, Borachio, admits it.

Don Pedro has been portrayed by [[Denzel Washington]] in the [[Samuel Goldwyn Company]] 1993 [[Much Ado About Nothing (1993 film)|film]]. He was played by Reed Diamond in [[Joss Whedon]]&amp;apos;s [[Much Ado About Nothing (2012 film)|interpretation of the play]] which was released in 2012.
