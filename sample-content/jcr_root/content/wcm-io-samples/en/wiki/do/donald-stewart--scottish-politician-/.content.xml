&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Donald James Stewart&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (17 October 1920 &amp;amp;ndash; 23 August 1992) was [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) from 1970 to 1987 for the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]].  He also served as President of the Scottish National Party (SNP) from 1982 to 1987.

Born in [[Stornoway, Outer Hebrides|Stornoway]], [[Western Isles]], [[Scotland]] in 1920, Stewart became convinced of the case for [[Scottish independence]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|United Kingdom general election]] 1935, and joined the SNP the following year. Left-leaning by political conviction, he subsequently joined the [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], but remained a member for only a short time before rejoining the SNP.

He saw active service during the [[Second World War]] with the Royal Navy, remaining an SNP member throughout.  He returned to Stornoway where he served as a [[councillor]] for many years (twice serving as the town&amp;apos;s [[provost (civil)|provost]]) before election as an SNP MP in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970]]. He was the SNP&amp;apos;s first ever MP returned at a [[general election]], and the last declared result in 1970, which caused great attention in the media.

Stewart was the SNP&amp;apos;s sole [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] representative from 1970 until he was joined by [[Margo MacDonald]] who won [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in the [[Glasgow Govan by-election, 1973|by-election]] of 1973. At the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 General Election]] he was joined by six other SNP MPs, and at the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October General Election of that year]] this number increased to eleven.  Stewart became the SNP parliamentary group leader, with [[William Wolfe]] as the SNP leader overall.

Donald Stewart also attempted to introduce a [[Scottish Gaelic]] private members bill, but this was scuppered by certain politicians{{weasel-inline|date=February 2008}}. The language had to wait until 2004 for official recognition from the devolved [[Scottish Parliament]].

Stewart continued to represent the Western Isles until 1987 when he retired from front-line politics.  At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|General Election]] of that year his seat was gained by the Labour Party from the SNP and was consequently held until the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] when it was regained by the SNP&amp;apos;s [[Angus Brendan MacNeil]].

Stewart was working on an [[autobiography]] when he died in 1992.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-donald-stewart-1542355.html Obituary: Donald Stewart], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Independent]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; August 25, 1992&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was edited and completed by his sister, and published in 1994 as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Scot in Westminster&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

It was Stewart who famously described the SNP as a &amp;quot;radical party, with a revolutionary aim&amp;quot;.
