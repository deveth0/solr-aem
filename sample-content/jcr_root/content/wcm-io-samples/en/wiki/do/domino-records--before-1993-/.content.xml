The second, better known, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Domino Records&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a United States based label, was in business from 1924 to 1931, producing standard 10-inch lateral cut 78s. The label was a subsidiary of [[Plaza Music Company]], headquartered in [[New York City]].  The label later became owned by [[American Record Corporation]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title= Country - The twisted root of rock &amp;apos;n&amp;apos; roll|last= Tosches |first=Nick |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=222–223 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rtkANgQuBdAC&amp;amp;dq=%22Domino+Records%22+(1917)|accessdate=2009-06-28}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Artists that they recorded included: [[Ben Pollack]], as well as artists whose records were issued on other ARC labels.

In 1933, ARC reconstituted the Domino label - this time with the same label style, but in gold - for an exclusive 100 series sold only at the John Gabel Co.  This lasted through about 1934.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;(referenced from &amp;quot;American Record Labels and companies - An Encyclopedia (1891-1943)&amp;quot; by Allan Sutton &amp;amp; Kurt Nauck, Mainspring Press 2000 (isbn 0-9671819-0-9)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
