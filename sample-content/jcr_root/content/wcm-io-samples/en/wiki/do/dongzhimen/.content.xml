[[Image:Beijing Dongzhimen 1908.jpg|thumb|Dongzhimen in 1908]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dongzhimen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|s=东直门|t=東直門|p=Dōngzhímén}}; [[Manchu language|Manchu]]: Tob dergi duka; lit. &amp;quot;East Straight Gate&amp;quot;) is the name of one of the gates in the old [[Beijing city fortifications]], it is now a transportation node in [[Beijing]].

The [[2nd Ring Road (Beijing)|2nd Ring Road]] currently links, albeit somewhat indirectly, with two roads which eventually become the [[Airport Expressway (Beijing)|Airport Expressway]] and [[China National Highway 101]]. A new flyover, and a new express road are being built that will connect directly with the Airport Expressway and is due within 2004.

The [[Beijing subway]] network has a [[Dongzhimen Station|node stop]] at Dongzhimen, where Lines 2 and 13 connect. Line 13 has its eastern terminus at Dongzhimen.

West of Dongzhimen is [[Guijie, Beijing|Guijie]], or &amp;quot;Food vessel street&amp;quot; (Dongzhimen Inner Street), extremely well known to locals as a food street.  The character for Gui (簋) refers to a round-mouthed bamboo container for food.  The name is frequently mistaken for a similar sounding word, meaning &amp;quot;ghost&amp;quot;, so some refer to the street as &amp;quot;Ghost street&amp;quot;.

Connecting to the east of Dongzhimen is [[Dongzhimen Outer Street]], which connects with the Northern Diplomatic Area and ultimately to the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|3rd Ring Road]] as well as the [[National Agricultural Exhibition Hall]].

1.5 km from Dongzhimen lies the nearby [[Sanlitun]] (三里屯) bar street, well-known to the expat community located in the heart of Beijing&amp;apos;s North Diplomatic Area.

Just outside the Dongzhimen station is a long-distance bus station area, which services a wide range of locations within and outside of Beijing. This includes special buses to the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] and long-distance buses to the mountains and caves north of Beijing and smaller suburban towns such as [[Pinggu District|Pinggu]].
