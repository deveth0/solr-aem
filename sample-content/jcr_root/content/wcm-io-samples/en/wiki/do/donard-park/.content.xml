== Features ==

The park features [[Association football|football]] and [[field hockey|hockey]] pitches and picnic facilities. It is also used as a starting point for [[Hillwalking|rambler]]s to climb the Mourne Mountains and has a [[YMCA]] centre including camping facilities. In 2006 the main entrance and car park were redeveloped and facilities upgraded. There are future plans for [[retail]] space and [[renting|rentable]] accommodation beside the park.  The local council have been petitioned to build a [[swimming pool]] in the park and had put in a request for a Northern Ireland National Cycling Velodrome Centre to be built there for the 2012 London Olympics.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | title=Donard Drome | work=WDR &amp;amp; RT Taggart | url=http://www.wdr-rt-taggart.com/news_1a.php | accessdate=2008-12-22}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 2008 local planners indicated they would not back the construction of the scheme in an area of outstanding natural beauty at the foothills of the Mournes. The council is now seeking alternative sites.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Telford | title=Planners block velodrome bid | work=[[Down Recorder]] | page= 1 | date=2008-04-02 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== History ==

The park was previously owned by the Annesley family until given over to the people of Newcastle and the local council took responsibility for maintaining it. During [[World War I]] members of the 10th Battalion of [[Royal Irish Rifles]] were stationed at Donard lodge in the park for training, before being sent to the [[Somme]] in [[France]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.1914-1918.net/ririfles.htm The Royal Irish Rifles]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.blackstaffpress.com/Book%20Preview/Somme.pdf The Road to the Somme]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

During World War II members of the [[U.S. Army]] [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th infantry division]] were based in Donard Park in preparation for [[D-Day]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article/1129/training-the-troops Training camps in Northern Ireland during World War II]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; They arrived in late October 1943.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.history.army.mil/reference/ireland/nistat.htm United States Army forces in Northern Ireland stations of units]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
