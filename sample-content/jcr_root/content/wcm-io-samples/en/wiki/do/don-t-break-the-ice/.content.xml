[[Image:Don&amp;apos;t Break the Ice.jpg|thumb|A Game of Don&amp;apos;t Break the Ice]]

The game is played with a set of plastic &amp;apos;ice blocks&amp;apos;, a stand, and included miniature mallets. The stand is turned upside down and the ice blocks placed into the frame, so that the &amp;quot;shared&amp;quot; uniform compression of the blocks pressed against each other will cause them to stay in place when the stand is turned upright. The players take turns removing blocks by tapping with the mallets. The game ends when one player &amp;apos;breaks the ice&amp;apos;, causing all remaining blocks to fall. The player who removed the most blocks without &amp;apos;breaking the ice&amp;apos; is the winner.
