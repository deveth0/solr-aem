The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Donations of Alexandria&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Autumn 34 BC) were a religio-political (theopolitical) statement by [[Cleopatra VII]] and [[Mark Antony]] in which they distributed lands held by [[Rome]] and [[Parthia]] amongst Cleopatra&amp;apos;s children, and granted them many titles, especially for [[Caesarion]], son of [[Julius Caesar]]. The Donations caused a fatal breach in Antony&amp;apos;s relations with Rome and were amongst the causes of the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]].

==Background==
The Donations followed Antony&amp;apos;s mixed military adventures in [[Parthia]] and [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]]. He had conquered the latter, but had failed in his main aim of defeating the Parthians. He attempted to play up his successes by creating a festival imitating a [[Roman Triumph]] to celebrate his victory over the Armenian leader [[Artavasdes II of Armenia|Artavasdes]], who was led in captivity through the city of Alexandria. Antony then held a public banquet in which he dressed as the god [[Dionysus]].&amp;lt;ref name = &amp;quot;prud&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Prudence J. Jones, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cleopatra: The Last Pharaoh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Haus Publishing, 2006, p.89-91&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The captured Armenian royal family were brought before Cleopatra, to whom they were expected to prostrate themselves, but they refused to do so, earning her wrath.&amp;lt;ref name = &amp;quot;prud&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==The Donations==
For the finale of the festivities, the whole city was summoned to the Gymnasium of Alexandria, where Antony and Cleopatra, dressed as [[Dionysus]]-[[Osiris]] and [[Isis]]-[[Aphrodite]], sat on golden thrones. [[Caesarion]] was depicted as [[Horus]], son of Isis. The children were similarly in the attire of their new kingdoms. Antony affirmed Cleopatra as queen of Egypt, Cyprus, Libya and central Syria.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Cassius Dio|Dio]] 49.41, 50.3; [[Plutarch]], Life of Antony 54, 58&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The Donations themselves included:
*[[Alexander Helios]] was named king of Armenia, [[Medes|Media]] and [[Parthia]];
*his twin [[Cleopatra Selene II]] got [[Cyrenaica]] and [[Libya]];
* the young [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]] was awarded [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and [[Cilicia]];
*Cleopatra was proclaimed Queen of Kings and Queen of Egypt, to rule with [[Caesarion]] (Ptolemy XV Caesar, son of [[Julius Caesar]])
*[[Caesarion]] was proclaimed as the son of the deified Julius Caesar ([[son of god]]), [[King of Kings]] and King of Egypt; Caesarion was declared legitimate heir of [[Julius Caesar]], although Caesar himself had adopted [[Octavian]] (later known as Augustus) in his will and left him majority of his fortune.

==Consequences==
Antony sent an announcement of the donations to Rome, hoping that the Senate would confirm them, which it refused to do.&amp;lt;ref name = &amp;quot;prud&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Octavian&amp;apos;s political position was threatened by the acknowledgement of Caesarion as legitimate and heir to Caesar&amp;apos;s name. Octavian&amp;apos;s base of power was his link with Caesar through [[Adoption in Rome|adoption]], which granted him much-needed popularity and loyalty of the legions.  Octavian increased the personal attacks against Mark Antony and Cleopatra and the triumvirate expired on the last day of 33 BC not to be renewed. Thus began the last civil war of the Roman Republic, with Octavian&amp;apos;s victory resulting in the transition to the Imperial Era.
