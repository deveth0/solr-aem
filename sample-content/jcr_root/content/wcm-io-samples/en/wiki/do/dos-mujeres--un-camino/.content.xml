&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dos mujeres, un camino&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Two Women, One Path&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[telenovela]], produced by [[Televisa]], which originally aired from August 2, 1993 to July 1, 1994, on [[Canal de las Estrellas]].

==Plot==
The series tells the story of Johnny, a Mexican truck driver and family man who falls in love with a woman he meets in his travels, and of the complications as a consequence of his new love. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dos Mujeres...&amp;apos;&amp;apos; used the then-new [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) as a backdrop to the story; Johnny transported merchandise from Mexico to the United States.

Johnny had enemies in [[Tijuana]], where he was blamed for the death of a young man by the Montegarza family. Johnny is still very in love with his wife when he falls for a young waitress, Tanya ([[Bibi Gaytán]]), whose mother owns a restaurant that Johnny frequents. Tanya does not know he is married, and Raymundo, a police officer in love with Tanya, is working with fellow officer Ángel to pursue the head of the family that blames Johnny for the young man&amp;apos;s death.

It is later discovered that Johnny did not cause the young man&amp;apos;s death, and while he was struggling to decide whether he wants to stay with his wife or his girlfriend, Tanya dies taking a knife thrust intended for her rival – Johnny&amp;apos;s wife – Ana Maria. Johnny and Ana Maria reconcile after Tanya&amp;apos;s death. The final scene shows the couple retiring for the evening. Johnny, dreaming of Tanya&amp;apos;s death, calls her name in his sleep. When he awakes in the morning, Ana Maria and the children are gone.
