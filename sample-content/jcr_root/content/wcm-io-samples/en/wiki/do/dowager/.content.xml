A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;dowager&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[widow]] who holds a title or property, or [[dower]], derived from her deceased husband. As an adjective, &amp;quot;dowager&amp;quot; usually appears in association with [[monarchy|monarchical]] and [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] titles.

In loose popular usage, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;dowager&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as a stand-alone noun may be used to refer to any elderly widow, especially one who is wealthy or behaves with dignity.

==Use in the United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the widow of a [[peerage|peer]] may continue to use the style she had during her husband&amp;apos;s lifetime, e.g. &amp;quot;Countess of [[placeholder name|Loamshire]]&amp;quot;, provided that his successor, if any, has no wife to bear the plain title.  Otherwise she more properly prefixes either her [[given name|forename]] or the word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dowager&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, e.g. &amp;quot;Jane, Countess of Loamshire&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Dowager Countess of Loamshire&amp;quot;.  (In any case she would continue to be called &amp;quot;Lady Loamshire&amp;quot;.)

==Monarchical dowagers==
[[Dowager Queen]] is used in the United Kingdom and several other countries.

In reference to the fallen [[Romanov|Russian imperial family]] and the [[Emperor of China|Monarchy of China]], the term &amp;quot;[[Dowager Empress]]&amp;quot; was used in English to describe the wife of a deceased [[emperor]].{{cn|date=July 2012}}
