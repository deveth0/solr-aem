&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dominique Joseph Garat&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (8 September 1749 &amp;amp;ndash; 9 December 1833) was a [[France|French]] ([[Basque people|Basque]]) [[writer]] and [[politician]].

== Biography ==
Garat was born at [[Bayonne]].  After a good education under the direction of a relation who was a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;curé&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and a period as an advocate at [[Bordeaux]], he came to [[Paris]], where he obtained introductions to the most distinguished writers of the time, and became a contributor to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Encyclopedie méthodique&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Mercure de France]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He gained a reputation by an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;éloge&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on [[Michel de l&amp;apos;Hôpital]] in 1778, and was afterwards crowned three times by the [[Académie française]] for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;éloges&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on [[Suger]], [[Charles de Sainte-Maure, duc de Montausier|Montausier]] and [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]]. In 1785 he was named professor of history at the Lycée, where his lectures were as popular as those of GF Laharpe on literature.

Elected as a deputy to the states-general in 1789, Garat rendered important service to the popular cause by his narrative of the proceedings of the Assembly, in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Journal de Paris&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. His elder brother, Dominique (1735–1799), with whom he is sometimes confused, was also a deputy to the states-general. [[Georges Danton]] named him minister of justice in 1792, and in this capacity entrusted to him what he called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;commission affreuse&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of communicating to King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] his sentence of death. In 1793 Garat became minister of the interior, in which position he proved quite inefficient. Though himself uncorrupt, he overlooked the most scandalous corruption in his subordinates, and in spite of a detective service which kept him accurately informed of every movement in the capital, he failed to maintain order.

At last, disgusted with the excesses which he had been unable to control, he resigned on 15 August 1793. On 2 October he was arrested for [[Girondist]] sympathies but soon released, and he escaped further molestation owing to the friendship of [[Paul François Jean Nicolas Barras|Barras]] and, more especially, of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]]. On the [[French Revolutionary Calendar|9th Thermidor]], however, he took sides against Robespierre, and on 12 September 1794 he was named by the Convention as a member of the executive committee of public instruction.

His works include, besides those already mentioned, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Considerations sur Ia Révolution Française&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Paris, 1792); &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mémoire sur la Révolution, ou exposé de ma conduite&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1795); &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mémoires sur la vie de M. Suard, sur ses écrits, et sur le XVIII&amp;apos; siècle&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1820) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;éloges&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on Joubert, Kléber and Desaix; several notices of distinguished persons; and a large number of articles in periodicals.
