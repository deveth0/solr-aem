The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;double squeeze&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a type of [[Squeeze play (bridge)|squeeze play]] in the [[card game]] of [[contract bridge|Bridge]].

Double squeezes are a combination of two [[simple squeeze]]s carried out against both opponents. If both squeezes are executed by the same trick, that is the same squeeze card, the double squeeze is called simultaneous.
If both opponents are squeezed on different tricks (the squeeze card is then a card in the suit that was menacing the opponent squeezed first) the double squeeze is called non-simultaneous.

As there are only four suits in contract bridge the two simple squeezes can only be combined by using a menace for both opponents, the squeeze card being in the fourth suit.

The following diagram demonstrates the basics of a double squeeze.

In the same trick (this is therefore a simultaneous double squeeze), East is squeezed in the [[pointed suit]]s.{{Clear}}
