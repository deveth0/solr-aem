&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Z88DK&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Small-C]]-derived [[cross compiler]] for a long list of [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] based computers. The name derives from the fact that it was originally developed to target the [[Cambridge Z88]]. Z88DK is much developed from Small-C and it accepts many features of [[ANSI C]] with the notable exception of [[Array data structure|multi-dimensional arrays]] and prototyped [[function pointer]]s.

It has been used for many software and hardware projects, notably the REX DK (targeted to the REX 6000 platform) and the S1 SDK (targeted to the [[S1 MP3 Player]]) teams.

The compiler is highly portable, and is known to be run on [[AmigaOS]], [[BeOS]], [[HP-UX]] 9, [[Linux]], [[BSD]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Win32]], [[Win16]] and [[MS-DOS]].
