&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;E.L. Wisty&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a fictional character played by comedian [[Peter Cook]] throughout his career.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Harry|title=Biography Of Peter Cook|year=2011|publisher=Hachette UK}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; A bland, monotonal know-it-all, he was usually presented in the form of monologues and sketches in which he bores members of the public.

Originally titled Mr. Boylett after the table butler at [[Radley College]], Cook&amp;apos;s secondary school, Cook delighted school friends with impressions of Boylett, telling bizarre tales including that of the Holy Bee of [[Ephesus]]&amp;amp;nbsp;– a [[bee]] that had flown three times around the [[crucifixion|crucified]] [[Jesus]]&amp;amp;nbsp;– and how he would buy various inanimate objects when he thought he saw them move.

When Cook was encouraged to transfer these tales to stage monologues at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], he changed the name of his character to Mr Arthur Grole, then to E.L. Wisty.

The character was played at &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Beyond the Fringe]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which featured the most famous Wisty sketch, involving his former aspirations of becoming a [[judge]], in which his lack of [[Latin]] caused him to fail &amp;quot;the rigorous judging exams&amp;quot;. This led to his becoming a coal miner instead, having passed the exams, claiming that, &amp;quot;They only ask you one question. They ask, &amp;apos;Who are you?&amp;apos; and I got 75 percent on that.&amp;quot;

Wisty was famed for bothering members of the public on park benches on topics including [[tadpole]]s, [[Royal family|royalty]], [[newt]]s, peace through [[nudism]], inalienable rights, and his friend Spotty Muldoon. His &amp;apos;foils&amp;apos; were such comic actors as [[John Cleese]] and [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]].

In 1964, Wisty and Spotty formed the World Domination League, with aspirations to dominate the world by 1958; he enlisted a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Private Eye]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; secretary to send out postcards.&amp;lt;ref name=wendycook&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Wendy E|title=So Farewell Then: The Untold Life of Peter Cook|year=2006|publisher=HarperCollins|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QsdILCeLyNIC&amp;amp;lpg=PA296&amp;amp;dq=E%20L%20Wisty&amp;amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=E%20L%20Wisty&amp;amp;f=false|page=296}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  &amp;quot;We shall move about in people&amp;apos;s rooms and say, &amp;apos;Excuse me, we are the World Domination League. May we dominate you?&amp;apos; Then, if they say &amp;apos;Get out,&amp;apos; of course we give up.&amp;quot;

Their list of demands were:
#Total domination of the world by 1958.
#Domination of the astral spheres quite soon too.
#The finding of lovely ladies for Spotty Muldoon within the foreseeable future.
#Getting a nuclear arm to deter with.
#The bodily removal from this planet of [[C. P. Snow]] and [[Alan Freeman]] and their replacement with fine trees.
#Stopping the government from crawling up our pipes and listening to all we say.
#Training bees for uses against foreign powers, and so on.
#Elimination of spindly insects and encouragement of lovely little newts who dance about and are happy.
#E.L. Wisty for God.
