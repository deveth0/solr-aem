        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Culhwch&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-cy|kʉlˈhuːχ}}, with the final consonant of Scottish &amp;quot;loch&amp;quot;), in [[Welsh mythology]], is the son of [[Cilydd|Cilydd son of Celyddon]] and [[Goleuddydd]], a cousin of [[King Arthur|Arthur]] and the [[protagonist]] of the story &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Culhwch and Olwen]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the earliest of the [[Middle Welsh|medieval Welsh]] tales appended to [[Lady Charlotte Guest]]&amp;apos;s edition of the [[Mabinogion]]). In this tale the [[etymology]] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Culhwch&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is explained as &amp;quot;sow run&amp;quot; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;cul&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;narrow, a narrow thing&amp;quot;; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;hwch&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;sow, pig&amp;quot;), but this is likely to be [[folk etymology]]. According to the narrative, Culhwch is born to his maddened mother [[Goleuddydd]] after she is frightened by a herd of swine. The swineherd finds Culhwch in the pigs&amp;apos; run, and takes him back to his father Cilydd. Culhwch is described as being &amp;quot;of gentle lineage&amp;quot;.

&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Horses shall I have, and chivalry; and my lord and kinsman [[King Arthur|Arthur]] will obtain for me all these things. And I shall gain thy daughter, and thou shalt lose thy life.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Go forward...and when thou hast compassed all these marvels, thou shalt have my daughter for thy wife.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
Culhwch and Ysbaddaden.
]]

Culhwch&amp;apos;s father, [[Cilydd|King Cilydd son of Celyddon]], loses his wife [[Goleuddydd]] after a difficult childbirth. When he remarries, the young Culhwch rejects his stepmother&amp;apos;s attempt to pair him with his new stepsister. Offended, the new queen puts a curse on him so that he can marry no one besides the beautiful [[Olwen]], daughter of the [[giant (mythology)|giant]] Ysbaddaden. Though he has never seen her, Culhwch becomes infatuated with her, but his father warns him that he will never find her without the aid of his famous cousin [[King Arthur|Arthur]]. The young man immediately sets off to seek his kinsman. He finds him at his court in [[Celliwig]] in [[Cornwall]] and asks for support and assistance.

Arthur agrees to help, and sends six warriors to join Culhwch in his search for Olwen. They travel onwards until they come across the &amp;quot;fairest of the castles of the world&amp;quot;, and meet Ysbaddaden&amp;apos;s [[shepherd]] brother, Custennin. They learn that the castle belongs to Ysbaddaden, that he stripped Custennin of his lands and murdered the shepherd&amp;apos;s twenty-three children out of cruelty. Custennin set up a meeting between Culhwch and Olwen, and the maiden agrees to lead Culhwch and his companions to Ysbadadden&amp;apos;s castle. The warrior [[Sir Kay|Cai]] pledges to protect the twenty-fourth son, [[Goreu fab Custennin|Goreu]] with his life.

The knights attack the castle by stealth, killing the nine porters and the nine watchdogs, and enter the giant&amp;apos;s hall. Upon their arrival, Ysbaddaden attempts to kill Culhwch with a poison dart, but is outwitted and wounded, first by [[Bedivere|Bedwyr]], then by the enchanter [[Menw]], and finally by Culhwch himself. Eventually, Ysbaddaden relents, and agrees to give Culhwch his daughter on the condition that he completes a number of impossible tasks (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;anoethau&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), including hunting the [[Twrch Trwyth]] and recovering the exalted prisoner [[Mabon ap Modron]]. Culhwch accepts the giant&amp;apos;s child and, with the help of Arthur and his knights, eventually completes the numerous tasks.

With the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;anoethau&amp;apos;&amp;apos; completed, Culhwch, Goreu and others who &amp;quot;wished ill to Ysbaddaden Bencawr&amp;quot; ride to his court. The giant&amp;apos;s beard, skin and [[flesh]] are shaved off by Caw of Pictland and, accepting his humiliation and defeat, he is dragged away by Goreu, who avenges his murdered brothers by [[decapitation|beheading]] the giant. Ysbaddaden&amp;apos;s head is placed on the spike of the citadel, Goreu claims his uncle&amp;apos;s lands as his own, and Olwen is free to marry her love.

==Other appearances==
A brief reference to Culhwch is made in the ninth-century poetic cycle &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Canu Heledd&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;(The Song of Heledd)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in which the mythological hero is compared to [[Cynddylan]], a seventh-century ruler of [[Pengwern]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Canu Heledd.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

A warrior by the name of Culhwch appears prominently in the [[The Warlord Chronicles|Warlord Chronicles]] trilogy by [[Bernard Cornwell]].
