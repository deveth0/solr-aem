&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cublington&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] and one of 110 [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]]es&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.aylesburyvaledc.gov.uk Ayelsbury District Council web site.] Retrieved 30 June 2009&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; within [[Aylesbury Vale]] district in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].  It is about seven miles (11&amp;amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Aylesbury]]. The village name is [[Old English language|Anglo Saxon]] in origin, and means &amp;apos;Cubbel&amp;apos;s estate&amp;apos;.  In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 it was recorded as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Coblincote&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The [[parish]] [[Church (building)|church]] of [[St Nicholas]] is built in the [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|perpendicular]] style.  The tower of the church is decorated with blank [[tracery]] windows.  Inside, the [[chancel]] arch has unusual [[corbel]]s of a man and a [[monkey]]. At one time there was also a Methodist Chapel in the village.

500 yards (500 m) from the church is a small man-made hill, about {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high, known as &amp;quot;The Beacon&amp;quot;, it is in fact the [[motte-and-bailey|motte]] of a small [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[castle]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=344590 Cublington, The Beacon (Pastscape)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

North west of the church the 18th century stable block of the former [[manor house]] survives, it is an impressive building built of brick.  A [[granary]] also survives built on an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]d [[basement]].  This is rare as granaries in the area tended to be built on [[saddle stone]]s.  This type of agricultural building was generally raised from the ground to deter [[rodent]]s.

There are some houses of note, these include: Old Manor Farm, a large low house with a recently created series of spectacular gardens; and opposite the church, the  former [[rectory]], dating from the 18th century with more recent additions, and an informal garden, open to the public once or twice a year.  Neales Farm is an H plan [[half-timbered]] house dating from circa 1600.

The village has many old cottages, as well as small enclaves of newly built houses.

In 1971, the Report of the Roskill Commission on the London Airport expansion selected Cublington as the location of a proposed third airport for [[London]] on the basis of [[Cost Benefit Analysis]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite hansard | house=House of Commons | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1971/mar/04/third-london-airport-roskill-commission | date = March 4, 1971  }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; One Commission member, planner [[Colin Buchanan (town planner)|Colin Buchanan]], produced a dissenting report rejecting the proposal to build on Cublington as &amp;quot;an environmental disaster.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=397849&amp;amp;section=4.2 The use of systems analysis in public policy] [[Open University]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The government later rejected the Roskill recommendation on environmental grounds, in favour of a site at [[Maplin Sands]], [[Foulness]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.waltpatterson.org/airptcncrd.pdf Patterson, Walt  (1973)  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Airports, Concorde in trouble&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Environment: London Report] Retrieved 15 July 2009&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The village pub is called &amp;quot;The Unicorn&amp;quot;.
