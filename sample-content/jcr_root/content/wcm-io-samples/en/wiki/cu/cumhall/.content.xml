&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cumhall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (earlier &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cumall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, pronounced roughly &amp;quot;Coo-al&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Cool&amp;quot;) son of Trénmór (&amp;quot;strong-great&amp;quot;) is a figure in the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]], a leader of the [[fianna]] and the father of [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]].

Cumhall was a suitor for the hand of [[Muirne]], daughter of the [[druid]] [[Tadg mac Nuadat]], future mother of Fionn mac Cumhaill, but Tadg refused him, so he and Muirne eloped. Tadg appealed to the [[High King of Ireland|High King]], [[Conn of the Hundred Battles]], who made war against Cumhall. Cumhall was killed in the Battle of Cnucha, as recounted in the Middle Irish tale &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cath Cnucha&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, by [[Goll mac Morna]], who took over leadership of the fian, but Muirne was already pregnant with his son, Fionn. Cumhall is reputed to be buried within the grounds of Castleknock College, (an all-boys secondary school in Dublin 15), supposedly under a hill upon which an old water tower now stands.

Attempts to connect Cumhall with [[Camulos]], a [[Celt]]ic [[deity|god]] of war, are now largely rejected. [[Old Irish]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;cumal&amp;apos;&amp;apos; means &amp;quot;female slave&amp;quot;, and it is possible that a noble father was invented for Fionn to obscure an ignoble origin. Alternatively, some early texts call the hero &amp;quot;Fionn mac Umaill&amp;quot;, which may indicate his father&amp;apos;s name was originally Umall.

Cumhall had a brother, Crimmal, who was an ally of Fionn.
