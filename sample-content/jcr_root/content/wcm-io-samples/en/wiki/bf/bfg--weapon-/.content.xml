The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;BFG&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a fictional [[weapon]] found in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Doom (series)|Doom]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Quake (series)|Quake]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[video game]] series.

The versions found in the Doom games are called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;BFG 9000&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and those in Quake &amp;apos;&amp;apos;BFG 10K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In mods, various other versions made by fans can be found.

The abbreviation BFG stands for &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Big Fucking Gun&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; as described in [[Tom Hall]]&amp;apos;s original &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Doom&amp;apos;&amp;apos; design document and in the user manual of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Quake II]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; manual says it stands for &amp;quot;Big, uh, freakinâ€™ gun&amp;quot;.  Another meaning of the name used in the [[Doom (film)|Doom]] motion picture is &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bio Force Gun&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;.

==Appearances==
The first version of Doom where it appears is the press beta release. In that version, the BFG 9000 released a cloud of 80 little plasma balls (randomly green or red) per shot.

In the first commercial &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Doom&amp;apos;&amp;apos; game, the BFG 9000 is a large firearm that fires giant balls of green [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The most powerful weapon in the games, it causes major damage to opponents hit by the radiation emitted by the projectile which can clear entire rooms of foes, and is often an instant kill if a target takes a direct hit from the projectile. The player is unaffected by the splash damage, which makes it possible to use the BFG 9000 safely in close quarters, unlike some of the other powerful weapons. In the first &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Doom (series)|Doom]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; the weapon can only be picked up in the third and fourth episodes.

In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Doom 3]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the BFG 9000 has a charge-based system where holding down the trigger causes the weapon to accumulate energy, resulting in a more powerful shot.  Overcharging the BFG will cause it to overheat and explode, killing the player instantly.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Quake II]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Quake III Arena]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; pay homage to the BFG 9000 with a pair of similar weapons both called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;BFG10K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Q2&amp;apos;&amp;apos; version sends a slow plasma glob which  releases fast firing shots that target multiple enemies at once. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quake III Arena&amp;apos;&amp;apos; version of the BFG acts very differently, sending fast plasma orbs.

In the [[Doom (film)|Doom movie]], the &amp;quot;bio force gun&amp;quot; fires a bright blue projectile which appears to burst on impact and spray a [[causticity|caustic]] substance over its target and the surrounding area.
