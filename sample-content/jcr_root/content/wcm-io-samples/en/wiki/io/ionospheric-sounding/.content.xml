        text="&lt;p&gt;In [[telecommunication]] and radio science, an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ionospheric sounding&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a technique that provides real-time [[data]] on [[high-frequency]] ionospheric-dependent [[radio propagation]], using a basic [[system]] consisting of a synchronized transmitter and receiver.

The time [[Propagation delay|delay]] between [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] and reception is translated into effective [[ionospheric layer]] altitude. Vertical incident [[sounding]] uses a collocated transmitter and receiver and involves directing a range of frequencies vertically to the [[ionosphere]] and measuring the values of the reflected returned signals to determine the effective ionosphere layer altitude. This technique is also used to determine the [[critical frequency]]. Oblique sounders use a transmitter at one end of a given propagation path, and a synchronized receiver, usually with an oscilloscope-type display (ionogram), at the other end. The transmitter emits a stepped- or swept-[[frequency]] [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] which is displayed or measured at the receiver. The measurement converts [[time]] delay to effective altitude of the ionospheric layer. The ionogram display shows the effective altitude of the ionospheric layer as a function of frequency.
