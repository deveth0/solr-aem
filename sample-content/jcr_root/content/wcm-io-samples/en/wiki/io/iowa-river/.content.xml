The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Iowa River&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[tributary]] of the [[Mississippi River]] in the state of [[Iowa]] in the [[United States]].  It is about {{convert|323|mi}} long&amp;lt;ref name=NHD&amp;gt;U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. [http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/ The National Map], accessed May 13, 2011&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and is open to small river craft to [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]], about {{convert|65|mi}} from its mouth. Its major tributary is the [[Cedar River (Iowa River)|Cedar River]].

It rises in two branches, the West Branch and East Branch, both of which have their [[headwaters]] in [[Hancock County, Iowa|Hancock County]], each about {{convert|38|mi}} long and which join in [[Belmond, Iowa|Belmond]].&amp;lt;ref name=NHD/&amp;gt;

The Iowa then proceeds roughly in a southeast direction, passing through the city of [[Iowa Falls, Iowa|Iowa Falls]], through a scenic valley to [[Steamboat Rock, Iowa|Steamboat Rock]], then through the cities of [[Eldora, Iowa|Eldora]], [[Marshalltown, Iowa|Marshalltown]], [[Tama, Iowa|Tama]], and [[Marengo, Iowa|Marengo]], and through the [[Amana Colonies]] in [[Iowa County, Iowa|Iowa County]]. In [[Johnson County, Iowa|Johnson County]], it becomes impounded by the Coralville Dam in the [[Coralville Lake|Coralville Reservoir]], which turns southward to the spillway. The river runs generally south and passes through [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]] and the [[University of Iowa]] campus. A [[lowhead dam]] at Burlington Street in Iowa City is the last dam before the river&amp;apos;s confluence with the Mississippi. South of Iowa City, it is joined by the [[English River (Iowa)|English River]], and then in [[Louisa County, Iowa|Louisa County]] it is joined by the [[Cedar River (Iowa River)|Cedar River]] to flow into the Mississippi.

The Iowa River is noted for recreational and commercial fishing. Game fish include [[largemouth bass|largemouth]] and [[smallmouth bass]], [[walleye]], [[northern pike]], [[channel catfish|channel]] and [[flathead catfish]], [[crappie]] and other [[panfish]]. The Coralville Reservoir is [[commercial fishing|commercially fished]] for [[carp]] and [[ictiobus|buffalo fish]].

[[Pine Lake State Park]] is located on the Iowa River at [[Eldora, Iowa|Eldora]].

==Floods==
The Iowa can flood, notably in the [[June 2008 Midwest floods]], and the [[Great Flood of 1993]]. The Cedar and its tributaries, including the [[Shell Rock River]], can contribute to flooding events.
