James was born in [[Croydon]], [[Surrey]], [[England]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;GRO Register of Births: SEP 1928 2a 638 CROYDON - Ioan M. James, mmn - Surridge&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and was educated at [[St Paul&amp;apos;s School, London]] and [[Queen&amp;apos;s College, Oxford]]. In 1953 He earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.

In 1957 he was appointed Reader in Pure Mathematics, a post which he held until 1969. From 1959 until 1969 he was a Senior Research Fellow at St John&amp;apos;s College. He held the [[Savilian chair of geometry|Savilian Chair of Geometry]] at the University of Oxford from 1970 to 1995. He is now a [[professor emeritus]].

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1968.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://royalsociety.org/about-us/fellowship/fellows/|title= Fellows |publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 7 November 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 1978 the [[London Mathematical Society]] awarded him the [[Senior Whitehead Prize]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web
