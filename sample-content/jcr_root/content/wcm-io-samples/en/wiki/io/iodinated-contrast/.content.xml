&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Iodinated contrast&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a form of intravenous [[radiocontrast]] (radiographic dye) containing [[iodine]], which enhances the visibility of vascular structures and organs during [[radiography|radiographic]] procedures.  Some pathologies, such as [[cancer]], have particularly improved visibility with iodinated contrast.

Iodinated contrast media may either be [[oil]]-based or water-[[Solubility|soluble]], the former of which is slowly absorbed by body tissue and is usually only used in [[sialography|sialographic]] and [[hysterosalpingography|hysterosalpingographic]] examinations. Water-soluble iodinated medium, which is more quickly absorbed, may be used in place of [[barium sulfate]] for [[gastrointestinal]] studies that are contraindicated by the use of barium for that reason.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Iodinated medium may also be either ionic or non-ionic. The ionic type tends to create a high [[Osmole (unit)|osmolality]] in [[blood]] and may cause a [[allergic reaction|contrast media reaction]] in some individuals,  which may be life-threatening for those with certain medical conditions. The non-ionic form decreases this risk, but is much more expensive.  The non-ionic contrast media is much more widely used today.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Shortly after infusion, iodinated contrast medium causes a warming sensation throughout the body. Sometimes this feeling is more pronounced in the pelvic area. Patients receiving contrast via IV typically experience a hot feeling around the throat, and this hot sensation gradually moves down to the pelvic area.

Iodinated contrast is [[nephrotoxicity|toxic to the kidneys]] and kidney function of the patient receiving a dose should be considered before the exam{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.  The estimated glomerular filtration rate ([[Renal function|eGFR]]) should be no lower than 30 mL/min in patients receiving iodinated contrast, and discretion should be used in patients with eGFR less 45 mL/min.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;UCSF Iodinated Contrast Guidelines&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.radiology.ucsf.edu/patient-care/patient-safety/contrast/iodinated], UC San Francisco Guidelines on the Administration of Intravenous Iodinated Contrast Media&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Following up with extra fluids after an injection is highly recommended.
