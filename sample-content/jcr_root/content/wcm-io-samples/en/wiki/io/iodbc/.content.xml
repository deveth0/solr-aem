&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;iODBC&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[open source]] initiative managed by OpenLink Software. It is a platform-independent [[Open Database Connectivity|ODBC]] [[Software development kit|SDK]] and runtime offering that enables the development of ODBC-compliant applications and drivers outside the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] platform. The prime goals of this project are as follows:
*Simplify the effort of porting ODBC applications from Windows to other platforms
*Simplify the effort of porting ODBC drivers from Windows to other platforms
*Create consistent ODBC-utilization experience across all platforms

== History ==
iODBC emerged from a cooperative effort between OpenLink Software and Ke Jin. OpenLink Software produced a Driver Manager-less ODBC SDK that it branded as [[Open Database Connectivity#UDBC|Universal DataBase Connectivity]] ([[ODBC#UDBC|UDBC]]) in 1993, because of the sporadic nature of shared library implementations across [[Unix]] platforms. Ke Jin used UDBC as inspiration for building a Driver Manager for ODBC outside the windows platform.

Over time Ke Jin and OpenLink Software decided to merge this effort into a single [[Open Source]] offering under the [[LGPL]] license.

This process occurred at a time when the [[Free Software Foundation]] sought to have iODBC as a [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] offering. The delay in determining final licensing status for iODBC led to the emergence of [[UnixODBC]] and led to a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] in the platform-independent ODBC SDK and runtime that exists today. Drivers and applications written using either SDK have remained compatible (a tribute to both projects).
