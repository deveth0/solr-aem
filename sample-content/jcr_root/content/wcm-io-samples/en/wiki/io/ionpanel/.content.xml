&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;IonPanel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a website management system written using [[PHP]] and [[MySQL]]. IonPanel initially began as a small PHP application designed to store and publish news on a website. IonPanel was later developed as a website engine, an application capable to producing dynamic websites responding to user input and allowing the website author to quickly create and modify content on that website without the use of conventional tools.

IonPanel 0.23 and 0.27 were prototypes, based upon the v76 Content Management System, but the code was rewritten and replaced by early 2002. Instead a new from-scratch design was developed, with help from other developers, and influences from both SACMS{{expand acronym|date=June 2012}} and GF-admin. The first release was in August 2002, and IonPanel soon attracted a loyal following.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} IonPanel was a strictly open source, free application.

Development has since been discontinued.
