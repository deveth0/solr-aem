&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;XHGC-TV&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[TV station]] owned by [[Televisa]], broadcasting from [[Mexico City]], and is the flagship of the [[Canal 5 (Televisa Network)|Canal 5]] network.

==History==
[[File:XHGC.png|thumbnail|Logo used from 2000 to 2013|left]]
XHGC signed on May 10, 1952, broadcasting a [[Mother&amp;apos;s Day]] event organized by the [[Excélsior]] newspaper; but the regular programming began at August 18, 1952.

The station was established by [[Guillermo González Camarena]], a Mexican [[engineer]] who was one of the inventors of modern [[color television]]; the station&amp;apos;s calls reflect his surnames. González Camarena was director and general manager of XHGC until his death in 1965.

In 1962, XHGC became the first station in Mexico to broadcast in color. By request of the same Guillermo González Camarena, the channel became space of children and youth. The first color program broadcasted was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Paraíso infantil&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Children&amp;apos;s Paradise&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). Mexico was also likely the third country in North America and the fourth in the world, behind the United States, Cuba and Japan, to introduce color television.

During its early years, XHGC also brought educational television to Mexican viewers, with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Telesecundaria&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a pioneering educational program in Mexico.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 1954, XHGC was one of the first stations in the world to broadcast an early version of [[3D television]], in which two of the same picture appear side-by-side on the screen, combined into a single 3-dimensional image using special glasses. This version of 3D television was developed by an American inventor, James Butterfield, and tested in Mexico on XHGC.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Fun With 3D-TV Down Mexico Way&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[TV Guide]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, October 30, 1954.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
