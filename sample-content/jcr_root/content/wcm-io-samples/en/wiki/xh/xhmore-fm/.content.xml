==Recent history==
For a number of years prior to [[1993 in radio|1993]], XHMORE had programmed a Top 40/CHR format with most of the music being in english and the presentation in Spanish. By 1994 it evolved into a Rock en Espanol format as &amp;quot;More FM&amp;quot; during its first incarnation, which lasted until 2004, when it flipped to [[English language|English]] [[rhythmic contemporary]] as &amp;quot;Blazin&amp;apos; 98.9&amp;quot;.  Market competitors included [[XHITZ-FM|XHITZ]] licensed to Mexico and [[KHTS-FM|KHTS]] licensed to the United States.  In 2009, the music stopped and the station adopted a [[sports radio]] format and was the local [[ESPN Radio]] affiliate.  On October 6, 2010, ESPN Radio was replaced by the current format (the Rock en Espanol format in its second incarnation) and the language of broadcasts changed from English back to [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The current ESPN Radio affiliates are [[XEPRS-AM|XEPRS]] and [[XEPE-AM|XEPE]].
