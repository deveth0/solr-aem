&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Okkir&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;okkil&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the term for [[Geometry|geometric]] and flowing designs (often based on an elaborate leaf and vine pattern) and folk [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] that can be usually found in [[Maranao]] and [[Muslim]]-influenced artwork, especially in the southern [[Philippines]], and in some parts of [[Southeast Asia]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Okir a dato&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refers to the ornamental design for men and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;okir a bay&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to that for women.

In the Philippines, an ancient proof of okir&amp;apos;s style of flowering symbols is the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;torogan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the ancestral home of the highest titleholder in a Maranao village. It is a symbol of power and prestige usually adorned during festivities. Its prominent part is the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;panolong&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a carved beam that protrudes in the front of the house and styled with okir motif. The okir design is found woven or printed in textiles, carved into wooden cemetery markers and wooden boxes, and it can also be found etched into knife or sword blades and handles, and cast or etched into various brass and silver objects.

Other variations of the okir involves the use of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[nāga]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or serpent motif. Maranao instruments usually are styled with okir. A more prominent variation is the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[sarimanok]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a chicken-like figure that carries a fish in its beak.
