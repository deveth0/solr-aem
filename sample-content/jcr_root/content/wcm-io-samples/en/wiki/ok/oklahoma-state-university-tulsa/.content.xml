&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oklahoma State University–Tulsa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, located in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], [[USA]], is the newest institution of the [[Oklahoma State University System]]. It was previously the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;University Center at Tulsa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; until it became OSU-Tulsa on January 1, 1999. OSU-Tulsa is unique in the fact that it is not recognized as its own entity, but rather an extension of the main [[Oklahoma State University]] campus in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]]. OSU-Tulsa works in conjunction with the main OSU campus and [[Tulsa Community College]] to provide Freshman and Sophomore level courses, enabling students to complete a four-year undergraduate course of study. [[Howard Barnett, Jr.]] has served as President of OSU-Tulsa since 2009.

==Academics==

The Tulsa campus focuses on junior, senior and graduate level education, providing opportunities for individuals to complete bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees.

==Campus==

The campus is spread over {{convert|200|acre|km2}}, just north of downtown Tulsa, in the historic [[Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma|Greenwood]] neighborhood. Tulsa facilities include traditional classrooms, distance-learning classrooms, computer labs, and a convention area.

The Helmerich Advanced Technology Research Center (ATRC) is a recent campus addition. This {{convert|125000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} engineering building has specialized labs for developing advanced materials targeted to local [[aerospace]], [[biotechnology]], and [[telecommunications]], and manufacturing industries.
