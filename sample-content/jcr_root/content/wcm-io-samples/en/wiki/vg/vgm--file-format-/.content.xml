The normal [[filename extension]] is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;.vgm&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but files can also be [[Gzip]] compressed into &amp;apos;&amp;apos;.vgz&amp;apos;&amp;apos; files.
Technically, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;.vgz&amp;apos;&amp;apos; files should be named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;.vgm.gz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but because some popular [[operating system]]s&amp;apos; [[file manager]]s cannot handle file name suffixes that themselves contain a dot, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;.vgz&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is used in order to launch a VGM player (e.g. [[Winamp]] with the proper [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]]) and not a [[data compression]] program such as [[WinZip]] or [[WinRAR]].

On November 20, 2005, VGM 1.50 was officially announced, and a new version of the input plugin released. The new version of the format now supports [[pulse-code modulation|PCM]] [[Program optimization|optimization]] for the [[Yamaha YM2612]] [[sound chip]], which makes sound files using the chip a lot smaller â€” sometimes with over 75% of size reduction. The first YM2612 VGM archive,  Project 2612, optimized all of its packages soon after.

As of May 6, 2011, the official VGM specification was updated from version 1.50 to 1.60; the following non-exhaustive list details each new change:

Version 1.51 changes (unofficial update)

The 1.51 spec sheet documents that this version is compatible with the 1.50 specification (with exception of the dual-chip support), but Maxim&amp;apos;s in_vgm Winamp plugin still exhibits issues when utilized.
* Support for audio playback and manipulation of many new chips and formats, notably:
** The YM Series ([[Yamaha YM2203|YM2203]], [[Yamaha YM2608|YM2608]], [[Yamaha YM2610|YM2610]], [[Yamaha YM3812|YM3812]], [[Yamaha YM3526|YM3526]], [[Yamaha Y8950|Y8950]], [[Yamaha YMF262|YMF262]], [[YMF271]], [[Yamaha YMF278|YMF278B]], and [[YMZ280B]])
** [[Ricoh RF5c68|RF5c68]] and RF5c164 (Sega CD PCM)
** Sega PCM and Sega 32x PWM
** [[General Instrument AY-3-8910|AY-3-8910]]
* Data block type information has been added for all new chips that need additional data.
* SN76489 Flags have been added.
* Dual-chip support has been added for nearly every chip.

Version 1.60 changes

Several new optimization methods have been created (optvgmrf and optvgm32).
* RF5cxx and PWM stream data blocks and a command for optimizing RF5cxx data streams have been added.
* Ability to control DAC Streams more easily has been added to support better optimizations.

As of the 1.60 update, compatibility with 1.50 format players has been broken.

Version 1.61

* [[Game Boy]] audio
* [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES/Famicom]] 2A03 audio
* [[POKEY]]
*Q-Sound
*(various others)
