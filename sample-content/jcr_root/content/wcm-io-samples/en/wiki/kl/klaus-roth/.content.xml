&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Klaus Friedrich Roth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 29 October 1925) is a [[Germany|German]]-born [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]] known for work on [[diophantine approximation]], the [[large sieve]], and [[discrepancy theory|irregularities of distribution]]. He was born in [[Wrocław|Breslau]], [[Prussia]], but was raised and educated in the UK. He was pupil at St. Paul&amp;apos;s School in London from 1939 to 1943 and then attended Cambridge University, graduating from [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]] in 1945.  In 1946 he began research at [[University College London]], under the supervision of [[Theodor Estermann]].

In 1952, Roth proved that subsets of the [[integer]]s of [[Szemerédi&amp;apos;s theorem|positive density]] must contain infinitely many [[arithmetic progression]]s of length three, thus establishing the first non-trivial case of what is now known as [[Szemerédi&amp;apos;s theorem]]. His definitive result, now known usually as the [[Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem]], but also just &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Roth&amp;apos;s theorem&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, dates from 1955, when he was a lecturer at [[University College London]]. He was awarded a [[Fields Medal]] in 1958 on the strength of it. He became a professor at University College London in 1961, and moved to a chair at [[Imperial College London]] in 1966, a position he retained until official retirement at 1988. He then changed his status to visiting professor and remained at Imperial College until 1996.
