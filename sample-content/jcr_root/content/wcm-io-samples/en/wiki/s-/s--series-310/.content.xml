[[File:SŽ 310 series EMU (04).JPG|thumb|right|300px|An SŽ 310 series EMU in Ljubljana, Slovenia]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;SŽ series 310&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[high-speed rail|high-speed]] [[Tilting train|tilting]] [[Electric Multiple Unit|EMU]] used on the InterCitySlovenija premium train service in [[Slovenia]], operated by [[Slovenske železnice]]. It is based on the [[Italy|Italian]] [[ETR 460]] commonly known as [[Pendolino]]. The train is capable of reaching a maximum speed of 200&amp;amp;nbsp;km/h. The train is electric single system - 3 kV DC. It is one of two Pendolino train services in Central and Eastern Europe - the other one is located in [[Czech Republic]] ([[ČD Class 680]].

InterCitySlovenija links the major cities of [[Slovenia]] in one line: [[Koper]] (only in summer), [[Ljubljana]], [[Zidani Most]], [[Celje]] and [[Maribor]], with frequent service that acts as a high-speed shuttle. Trains reach a maximum speed of 170&amp;amp;nbsp;km/h on the section between Ljubljana-Zalog and Ljubljana-Polje stations. The train is made up of three cars: two 2nd class cars and one 1st class car. The trains provide disabled access, as well as a [[telephone]] and a snack bar. There is a smoking section in one of the 2nd class cars; the rest of the train is non-smoking.

Slovenske železnice bought three trainsets, two of which operate on the (Koper-)Ljubljana-Maribor route and one of which operated on the Ljubljana-[[Venice]] Santa Lucia route as [[EuroCity|EC]] Casanova. This service was discontinued in April, 2008.
