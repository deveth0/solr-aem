&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Søgne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in [[Vest-Agder]] [[Counties of Norway|county]], [[Norway]].  Søgne was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see [[formannskapsdistrikt]]). [[Greipstad]] was separated from Søgne on 1 July 1913.

It is a coastal municipality, with a long stretch of coastline to the south. To the east, it borders the municipality of [[Kristiansand]], to the north and north-east [[Marnardal]] and [[Songdalen]], and to the west [[Mandal, Norway|Mandal]].

As opposed to the other municipalities of Vest-Agder, Søgne has not gone through a municipal merger in recent times. On the contrary, Greipstad was separated from Søgne in 1913 (and in 1964 merged with [[Finsland]] into [[Songdalen]]. The population of Søgne was 10 509 as of 1 January 2010.

==General information==
===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Søgne&amp;apos;&amp;apos; farm ([[Old Norse]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sygna&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), since the first church was built there. The farm is named after the river &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sygna&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (now [[Søgneelva]]) and the name of the river is derived from the verb &amp;apos;&amp;apos;súga&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which means &amp;quot;suck&amp;quot;.

===Coat-of-arms===
The [[Coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] is from modern times.  They were granted on 24 May 1985.  The arms show two typical road signs ([[cairn|varder]]), made of stones, which in historical times were used to mark the paths and tracks. Two of the largest of these signs are found in the municipality, and were already mentioned in the early 17th century. According to legend, they were already built by King [[Olaf II of Norway]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;(Heilag-Olav)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in the 11th century.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/nor/s/sogne.htm|author=Norske Kommunevåpen|year=1990|title=Nye kommunevåbener i Norden|accessdate=27 September 2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
