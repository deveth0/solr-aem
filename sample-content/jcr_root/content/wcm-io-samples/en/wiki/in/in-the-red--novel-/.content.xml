&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;In the Red&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 1989 novel by [[Mark Tavener]], a [[black comedy]] revolving around murder, finance, and intrigue in the halls of the [[BBC]].
Despite this, it was the BBC that successfully adapted it for both radio and television.

The title comes from the expression &amp;quot;[[wikt:in the red|in the red]]&amp;quot;.

In 1995, it was adapted for radio by Tavener and [[Peter Baynham]], and aired on [[BBC Radio 4]] with [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]] and [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] in lead roles.
The radio version was successful, and was followed by three sequels: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[In the Balance]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;In the Chair&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;In the End&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 1998, it was adapted for television by [[Malcolm Bradbury]], and aired on [[BBC Two]]. The series included a cast of famous UK television performers including [[Rik Mayall]], [[Warren Clarke]], [[Richard Griffiths]], [[Alun Armstrong (actor)|Alun Armstrong]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[John Sessions]] and [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]].

In 2000, a pair of characters, BBC executives played in both the radio and television versions by Stephen Fry and John Bird, were spun off into their own Radio 4 series, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Absolute Power (comedy)|Absolute Power]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, written by Tavener. A television version followed, written by other writers.
