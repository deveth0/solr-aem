A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;pie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a unit of [[currency]] in [[India]] that is no longer in use. It was the smallest currency unit, equal to 1/3 [[paisa]], 1/12 [[anna (coin)|anna]] or 1/192 [[rupee]]. It is abbreviated as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ps&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It was minted in the unique [[Torus|toroidal]] form of a circle with a hole. It was abolished in the [[decimalisation]] of Indian currency and also due to practically zero value due to [[inflation]]. It was used until the middle of the 20th century.

The pie was also used as a unit of currency in [[Burma]] and [[Pakistan]].
