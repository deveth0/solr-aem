        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Inventory&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are a collective of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[artists]], [[writers]] and art theorists, founded in 1996.

Some of their pieces see them engage in [[performance art]] in public spaces.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Coagulum (Oxford Street)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 2000, saw them form into a close group on [[London]]&amp;apos;s [[Oxford Street]], thus disrupting the flow of pedestrians, before entering a shopping centre and dancing to the piped music. For another piece, they played [[football (soccer)|football]] on [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] with a rubber skull, using [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[Admiralty Arch]] as goals.

Other pieces, such as the [[installation art|installation]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Requiem For The Empty Quarter&amp;apos;&amp;apos; at the [[The Approach Gallery|The approach]] gallery, [[Bethnal Green]] in 2002, used modified and written-upon objects found on the street.

In 2003, Inventory were nominated for the [[Beck&amp;apos;s Futures]] prize.
