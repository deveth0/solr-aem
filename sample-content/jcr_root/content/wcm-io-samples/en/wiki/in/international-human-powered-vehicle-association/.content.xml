The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;International Human Powered Vehicle Association (IHPVA)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is dedicated to promoting the design and development of [[human powered vehicle]]s.

== History ==

The IHPVA was [[World Human Powered Vehicle Association|founded in 1976]] in the USA and was for many years an association of individual members with the publications &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Human Power&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HPV News&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 1997, the IHPVA was reorganised into an international association with national organisations as members and an American association which adopted the name Human Powered Vehicle Association HPVA. Due to conflicts regarding record keeping and copyrights, the HPVA left the IHPVA in 2004. In 2008, the HPVA decided to rename itself to IHPVA while the IHPVA of this time decided to keep its name, resulting in a brief period with two organisations of the same name. In a hostile takeover, the American IHPVA also seized control of the domain name ihpva.org away from the international IHPVA. This tried to regain its domain by appealing to the [[ICANN]]&amp;apos;s ombudsman but was unsuccessful and in 2009 renamed itself to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[World Human Powered Vehicle Association|World Human Powered Vehicle Association (WHPVA)]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
