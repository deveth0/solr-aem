        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;International Day Against Police Brutality&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; occurs on March 15.  It first began in 1997 as an initiative of the Montreal based [[Collective Opposed to Police Brutality]] and the [[Anarchist flag|Black Flag]] group in [[Switzerland]]. In MontrÃ©al city-wide protests against the police are organized, and a demonstration is held before the police headquarters in downtown. For the past 17 years the protest has only been peaceful for 2 times. The protest is immediately declared illegal (because protesters don&amp;apos;t declare their itinerary) and crackdown on the demonstrators begins shortly after the protesters have gathered. Hundreds of people are arrested every year. The police use kettling, batons and are dressed in riot gear.

Acceptance of March 15 as a focal day of solidarity against [[police brutality]] varies from one place to another.  In the [[United States]], the [http://october22-ny.org/national/ October 22 Coalition to Stop Police Brutality, Repression, and the Criminalization of a Generation], a group mounted by the [[Revolutionary Communist Party, USA|RCP]], has succeeded in building support for October 22 (also known as O22) as [[National Anti Police Brutality Day]] since 1995.
