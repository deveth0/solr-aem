The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Independent Record&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (often abbreviated to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;IR&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a daily [[newspaper]] printed and distributed in [[Helena, Montana]]. It has a daily and Sunday circulation of approximately 14,000, according to the September 30, 2005, [[Audit Bureau of Circulations (North America)|Audit Bureau of Circulations]] Publisher Statement. The newspaper is part of the [[Lee Enterprises]] group, which owns 48 newspapers in 23 states.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.lee.net/aboutlee/ &amp;quot;About Lee&amp;quot;]. [[Lee Enterprises]]. Retrieved November 12, 2011.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== History ==

The roots of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;IR&amp;apos;&amp;apos; lie in two newspapers founded in 1867, the [[weekly newspaper|weekly]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Independent&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of [[Deer Lodge, Montana|Deer Lodge]] and the daily &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herald&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of Helena. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Independent&amp;apos;&amp;apos; soon moved to Helena and began daily publication in 1874. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herald&amp;apos;&amp;apos; later merged with the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Montana Daily Record&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was founded in 1900. The new publication was renamed the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Montana Herald-Record&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. And in 1943,  another merger followed: this time with the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Independent&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, to become the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Independent Record&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

After over thirty years of ownership by the [[Anaconda Copper Mining Company]], the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;IR&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was sold to Lee Enterprises in 1959. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;IR&amp;apos;&amp;apos; converted from [[hot metal typesetting|hot metal]] to [[phototype]] in 1973, and in 1975 installed one of the first newsroom computer systems. In the summer of 2002, a new press plant was opened and housed in a new {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} printing and distribution center.

==Features==
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;IR&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is known for its Friday [[editorial]]: &amp;quot;Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down,&amp;quot; in which it gives its stamp of either approval or disapproval on both local, national, or global events.
