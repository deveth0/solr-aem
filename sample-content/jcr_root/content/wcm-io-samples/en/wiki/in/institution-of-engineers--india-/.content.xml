The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Institution of Engineers (India)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;IEI&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is the national organization of engineering professionals in [[India]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.ieindia.org/AboutIEI.aspx Institution of Engineers (India) Official Website. About IEI.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; IEI has over 0.5 million members{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} from 15 engineering disciplines in 99 centers/chapters in India and overseas; it is the largest multi-disciplinary engineering professional society in the English-speaking world. Institution of Engineers (India) obtained the full membership of the Engineers Mobility Forum (EMF) at the Bi-annual International Engineers Meetings 2009 held at Kyoto, Japan on 17 June 2009. The IEI delegation to the meetings was led by Rear Admiral K O Thakare, President

IEI was established in 1920 in [[Madras]] (Chennai) with Sir Thomas R. J. Ward as the founding president and was formally inaugurated in 1921 by [[Lord Chelmsford]], the then-Viceroy of British India. In 1935, it obtained the [[Royal Charter]] of Incorporation from King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] “to promote and advance the science, practice and business of engineering”. Fellows of the Institution of Engineers (India) are entitled to use the post-nominals FIE, and all life corporate members are “Chartered Engineers” (CEng).

Since 1928, an associate membership ([[AMIE]]) to the IEI is deemed equivalent (by the [[Association of Indian Universities]] and the [[Union Public Service Commission]]) to an undergraduate degree in Engineering. For those who have not pursued a formal education in Engineering, an associate membership can be achieved by qualifying in the examination conducted by the institution ([[AMIE]] Examinations.)

Sir Thomas Guthrie Russell (president 1933&amp;amp;ndash;34) played a key role in the successful petition for a Royal Charter. The current president is Er S S Rathore, FIE.

Besides representing India in the Engineers Mobility Forum, the institution has been prominent in World Mining Congress (WMC), the [[World Federation of Engineering Organizations]] (WFEO), the Commonwealth Engineers’ Council (CEC), the Fédération Internationale du Béton (fib), and the Federation of Engineering Institutions of South and Central Asia (FEISCA). It has bilateral agreements with professional societies across the globe. It is currently headquartered in [[Kolkata]] (formerly known as Calcutta).

MHRD, Department of Higher Education, Government of India released an Official Memorandum in 2012 stating that candidates enrolled with IEI with permanent recognition upto May 31, 2013 only will be considered in force, pertaining to their course for equivalence in Central Government Jobs.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/OM_06122012.pdf&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

A writ petition was filed by IEI in Delhi High Court for quashing the orders of MHRD &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=119047&amp;amp;yr=2013&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;. Other professional bodies like The Institution Of Electronics &amp;amp; Telecommunication Engineering &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=106538&amp;amp;yr=2013,&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;, and The Institution Of Civil Engineers (India) &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=106539&amp;amp;yr=2013,&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;separately filed similar petitions against MHRD&amp;apos;s decision.

Currently the Honorable Delhi High Court has put a stay on MHRD&amp;apos;s decision to withdraw the recognition till final outcome of the petition.
