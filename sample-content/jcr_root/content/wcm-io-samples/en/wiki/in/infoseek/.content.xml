&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Infoseek&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a popular [[search engine]] founded in 1994 by [[Steve Kirsch]].

Infoseek was originally operated by the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Infoseek Corporation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, headquartered in [[Sunnyvale, California]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/19970702014416/info.infoseek.com/doc/contact.html Contacting Infoseek].&amp;quot; Infoseek. July 2, 1997. Retrieved on January 20, 2010.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Infoseek was bought by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 1998, and the technology was merged with that of the Disney-acquired [[Starwave]] to form the [[Go.com]] network. Since then it has been replaced with [[Yahoo!]] search and is no longer in use.

== Features ==

Infoseek featured a very complex system of [[search modifiers]], including [[Boolean logic|boolean]] modifiers such as the most basic &amp;quot;OR&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;NOT&amp;quot;, parentheses, and quotes, up to being able to say that one wanted one word or phrase to appear within &amp;apos;&amp;apos;x&amp;apos;&amp;apos; number of words from another word or phrase.

Before being bought by Disney, Infoseek also offered a free [[web hosting]] package. It was free of [[Internet advertising|advertising]], and had no limit on the amount of file storage space that could be used. Advertising was added after the Disney purchase.

== History ==

By September 1997, Infoseek boasted 7.3 million visitors per month.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;source&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090501140446/http://www.clubi.ie/webserch/engines/infoseek/history.htm Infoseek - a history (from WebSerch)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It bought out the [[WebChat Broadcasting System]] in April 1998.  Infoseek was bought by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 1998, and the technology was merged with that of the Disney-acquired [[Starwave]] to form the [[Go.com]] network.

Infoseek was the first search engine to sell advertising on a CPM (Cost Per Thousand Impressions) basis. In 1996, then east coast Sales Manager, Robert Formentin sold the first Cost Per Click programs as well as the precursor to pop-ups called daughter windows to Grey Advertising for a [[Procter &amp;amp; Gamble]] [[Pampers]] campaign.
In 1997 Infoseek was the first internet company to develop and launch [[behavioral targeting]] via its UltraMatch targeting algorithms.

In 1999, Infoseek engineer [[Li Yanhong]] moved to [[Beijing]], [[China]] and co-founded the search engine [[Baidu]].

In February 2001, Disney made the decision to cancel the service and lay off the entire staff. Eventually,{{When|date=January 2010}} the hosting service was shut down.

In 2001 Bernt Wahl, Andy Bensky and 15 software engineers—Infoseek employees—led a management buyout attempt from Disney but were ultimately rebuffed.

Infoseek&amp;apos;s [[Ultraseek]] Server software technology, an enterprise search engine product, was sold in 2000 to [[Inktomi (company)|Inktomi]]. Under Inktomi, Ultraseek Server was renamed &amp;quot;Inktomi Enterprise Search&amp;quot;.  In December 2002 (prior to [[Yahoo]]&amp;apos;s acquisition of Inktomi), the Ultraseek product suite was sold to a competitor [[Verity Inc]], who re-established the Ultraseek brand name and continued development of the product.

In December 2005, Verity was acquired by UK company [[Autonomy Corporation|Autonomy PLC]]. Under Autonomy, Ultraseek continues to be actively developed and marketed as Autonomy&amp;apos;s entry-level keyword-based site search offering.

== Domain name ==

Today, the &amp;quot;infoseek.com&amp;quot; [[domain name]] forwards to the &amp;quot;go.com&amp;quot; website. The brand name of Infoseek is now completely unused in North America; however it is still operating as [http://www.infoseek.co.jp Infoseek Japan].
