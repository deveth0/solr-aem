The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Infrared Optical Telescope Array&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (IOTA) was a [[stellar interferometer]] array. IOTA began with an agreement in 1988 among five Institutions, the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]], [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], the [[University of Wyoming]], and [[MIT]]/[[Lincoln Laboratory]], to build a two-telescope stellar [[interferometer]] for the purpose of making fundamental astrophysical observations, and also as a prototype instrument on which they could perfect techniques which could later lead to the development of a larger, more powerful array. On site construction went on for all 1993 and 1994, with first fringes in December 1993. It is located at [[Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory]].

In 2000 the third telescope came online providing [[closure phase]] observations, allowing [[aperture synthesis|aperture synthesis imaging]] to be performed for the first time at IOTA. The array was decommissioned and disassembled in summer 2006.
