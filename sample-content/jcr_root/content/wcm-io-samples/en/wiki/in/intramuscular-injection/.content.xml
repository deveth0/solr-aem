&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Intramuscular (or IM) injection&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the [[medical injection|injection]] of a substance directly into a [[muscle]]. In [[medicine]], it is one of several alternative methods for the administration of [[medication]]s (see [[route of administration]]). It is used for particular forms of medication that are administered in small amounts. Depending on the chemical properties of the drug, the medication may either be absorbed fairly quickly or more gradually.  Intramuscular injections are often given in the [[deltoid muscle|deltoid]] muscle of the [[arm]], the [[vastus lateralis]] muscle of the [[leg]], and the [[ventrogluteal]] and [[dorsogluteal]] muscles of the [[buttocks]].

==Uses==
Examples of medications that are sometimes administered intramuscularly are:
* [[Haloperidol]] (Haldol)
* [[Chlorpromazine]] (Thorazine)
* [[Lorazepam]] (Ativan)
* [[Codeine]]
* [[Morphine]]
* [[Methotrexate]]
* [[Metoclopramide]]
* [[Olanzapine]]
* [[Streptomycin]]
* [[Diazepam]]
* [[Prednisone]]
* [[Penicillin]]
* [[Interferon beta-1a]]
* [[Sex hormone]]s, such as [[testosterone]], [[estradiol valerate]], and [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] (as [[Depo Provera]])
* [[Dimercaprol]]
* [[Ketamine]]
* [[Lupron]]
* [[Naloxone]]
* [[quinine#Dosing|Quinine]], in its [[gluconate]] form
* [[Vitamin B12]], also known as cyanocobalamin

In addition, some [[vaccine]]s are administered intramuscularly:

* [[Gardasil]]
* [[Hepatitis A]] vaccine
* [[Rabies]] vaccine
* [[Influenza]] vaccines based on inactivated viruses are commonly administered intramuscularly (although there is active research being conducted as to the best route of administration).

[[Platelet-rich plasma]] injections can be administered intramuscularly.

Certain substances (e.g. [[ketamine]]) are injected intramuscularly for [[recreational drug use|recreational]] purposes.
