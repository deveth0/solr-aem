[[Image:Bairro de Interlagos.jpg|350px|thumb|right|View of Interlagos]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Interlagos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a upscale neighborhood located in the district of [[Socorro (district of São Paulo)|Socorro]] in the city of [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. Its name (adapted from [[Interlaken]], [[Switzerland]]) comes from the fact that the region is located between two large [[reservoir]]s, [[Guarapiranga]] and [[Billings Reservoir|Billings]], built in the early 20th century to supply [[water]] and [[electric power]] to the city. The suburb of Interlagos is located in the south region of São Paulo City to the right{{What|date=May 2012}} edge of the Guarapiranga reservoir.

The [[Autódromo José Carlos Pace]] itself is still commonly called Interlagos, although that has not been its official name since the 1970s, and it is actually located in the district of [[Cidade Dutra]], not Socorro.

The history of the Interlagos circuit dates back to the 1920s, when the city of São Paulo was undergoing a process of fast urbanization.
