An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;interplate earthquake&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[earthquake]] that occurs at the boundary between two [[tectonic plate]]s. Earthquakes of this type account for more than 90 percent of the total seismic energy released around the world.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citation|title=Earthquakes: 2006 Centennial Update&amp;amp;nbsp;â€“ The 1906 Big One|last=Bolt|first=Bruce|authorlink=Bruce Bolt|month=August|year=2005|isbn=978-0716775485|edition=Fifth|publisher=[[W. H. Freeman and Company]]|page=150}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; If one plate is trying to move past the other, they will be locked until sufficient stress builds up to cause the plates to slip relative to each other. The slipping process creates an earthquake with land deformations and resulting [[seismic wave]]s which travel through the Earth and along the Earth&amp;apos;s surface. Relative plate motion can be lateral as along a [[transform fault]] boundary or vertical if along a convergent [[subduction]] boundary or a [[rift (geology)|rift]] at a divergent boundary. At a subduction boundary the motion is due to one plate slipping beneath the other plate resulting in an interplate thrust or [[megathrust earthquake]].

Some areas of the world that are particularly prone to such events include the west coast of [[North America]] (especially [[California]] and [[Alaska]]), the northeastern Mediterranean region ([[Greece]], [[Italy]], and [[Turkey]] in particular), [[Iran]], [[New Zealand]], [[Indonesia]], [[India]], [[Japan]], and parts of [[China]].
