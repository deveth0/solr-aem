&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Investiture&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, from the Latin (preposition &amp;apos;&amp;apos;in&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and  verb &amp;apos;&amp;apos;vestire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;dress&amp;apos; from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;vestis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;robe&amp;apos;) is a rather general term for the formal installation of an [[incumbent]]
as the insignia can include the formal dress and adornment (robes of state, headdress etc.) the etymology refers to, but also other regalia in the widest sense, such as a throne or other seat of office, the word is a convenient generic term, also for such more specific cases as [[coronation]] (see that article and [[regalia]] for more on such ceremonies) and [[enthronement]], though these are also used (rather imprecisely, by analogy) in such extended sense.

==Secular usage==
The term is used to describe the installation of individuals in institutions that usually have been extant from feudal times. For example, the installation of heads of state and various other state functions with ceremonial roles are &amp;apos;&amp;apos;invested&amp;apos;&amp;apos; with office. Usually the investiture involves ceremonial transfer of the symbols of the particular office

Judges in many countries, including justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], are invested with their office. American justices typically take two oaths: one to uphold the [[Constitution of the United States]], and the other to apply justice equally.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,170760,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Preparations Begin for Roberts&amp;apos; Swearing In | date=29 September 2005}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Likewise, university presidents, rectors and chancellors are invested with office.

In the [[United Kingdom]], around 2,600 people are invested personally by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]] or a member of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]]. A list of those to be honoured is published twice a year, in either the [[New Year Honours]] or the [[Queen&amp;apos;s Birthday Honours]].

Approximately 24 investitures are held annually in [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[Windsor Castle]], one at the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. Previously, one investiture ceremony a year would also be held in [[Cardiff]].

There is also a poem written by Siegfried Sassoon called &amp;quot;The Investiture&amp;quot;. The poem is about a young man who was killed in battle during World War I.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite wikisource | title=The Investiture | last=Sassoon | first=Siegried | year = 1918}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The term is used in the [[Scout Association]] when enrolling a new youth member or an existing member is moving to a different section such as from Cubs to Scouts.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Scout Investiture Fact Sheet&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/facts/pdfs/fs315073.pdf| title=Scout Investiture Fact Sheet| date=4 September 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
