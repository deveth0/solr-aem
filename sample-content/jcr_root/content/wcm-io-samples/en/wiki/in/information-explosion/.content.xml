        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;information explosion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the rapid increase in the amount of [[publication|published]] [[information]] or [[data]] and the effects of this abundance.  As the amount of available data grows, the problem of [[information management|managing the information]] becomes more difficult, which can lead to [[information overload]]. The Online Oxford English Dictionary indicates use of the phrase in a March 1964 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[New Statesman]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; article.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;“Information.” http://dictionary.oed.com. accessed January 4, 2008&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The New York Times first used the phrase in its editorial content in an article by Walter Sullivan on June 7, 1964 in which he described the phrase as “much discussed.” (pE11.) The earliest use of the phrase seems to have been in an IBM advertising supplement to the New York Times published on April 30, 1961 and by Frank Fremont-Smith, Director of the American Institute of Biological Sciences Interdisciplinary Conference Program, in an April 1961 article in the AIBS Bulletin (p.&amp;amp;nbsp;18.)

Fortunately, techniques to gather knowledge from an overabundance of electronic information (e.g., [[data fusion]] may help in [[data mining]]) have existed since the 1970s.

==Related terms==
Since &amp;quot;information&amp;quot; in electronic media is often used synonymously with &amp;quot;data&amp;quot;, the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;information explosion&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is closely related to the concept of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;data flood&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also dubbed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;data deluge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). Sometimes the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;information flood&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is used as well. All of those basically boil down to the ever-increasing amount of [[Digital data|electronic data]] exchanged per time unit. The awareness about non-manageable amounts of data grew along with the advent of ever more powerful data processing since the mid-1960s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=data+flood%2Cdata+deluge%2Cinformation+flood&amp;amp;year_start=1955&amp;amp;year_end=2010&amp;amp;corpus=0&amp;amp;smoothing=2 Google Books Ngram viewer] for the terms mentioned here&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Web servers==
As of August 2005, there were over 70 million [[web server]]s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Hobbes&amp;apos; Internet Timeline 10.1|url=http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/|publisher=zakon.org|accessdate=27 August 2011|author=Robert H Zakon|date=15 December 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; {{As of|2007|09}} there were over 135 million web servers.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=August 2011 Web Server Survey|url=http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html|publisher=netcraft.com|accessdate=27 August 2011|month=August|year=2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Blogs==
According to [[Technorati]], the number of [[blogs]] doubles about every 6 months with a total of 35.3 million blogs {{As of|2006|04|lc=y|url=http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000432.html}}.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=State of the Blogosphere, April 2006 Part 1: On Blogosphere Growth|url=http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000432.html|publisher=Sifry&amp;apos;s Alerts (sifry.com)|accessdate=27 August 2011|date=April 17, 2006}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This is an example of the early stages of [[logistic growth]], where growth is approximately [[Exponential growth|exponential]], since blogs are a recent innovation.  As the number of blogs approaches the number of possible producers (humans), saturation occurs, growth declines, and the number of blogs eventually stabilizes.
