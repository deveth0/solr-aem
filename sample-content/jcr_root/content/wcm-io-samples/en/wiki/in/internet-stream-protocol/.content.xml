The Internet Stream Protocol family was never introduced for public use, but many of the concepts available in ST are similar to later [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] protocols and can be found in [[Multiprotocol Label Switching]] (MPLS). They also presaged [[Voice over IP]].

ST arose as the transport protocol of the [[Network Voice Protocol]], a pioneering computer network protocol for transporting human speech over packetized communications networks, first implemented in December 1973 by Internet researcher [[Danny Cohen (engineer)|Danny Cohen]] of the [[Information Sciences Institute]] (ISI) as part of [[DARPA|ARPA]]&amp;apos;s Network Secure Communications (NSC) project.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;RFC 741 (published 1977)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

First specified in 1979, ST was envisioned to be a connection-oriented complement to [[IPv4]], operating on the same level as IP but using a different header format from that used for IP datagrams. According to IEN-119, its concepts came from Danny Cohen, Estil Hoversten, and James W. Forgie. The protocol was notable for introducing the concepts of [[packetized voice]] (now [[Voice over IP]]), a [[talkspurt]] (a continuous segment of speech between silent intervals), and specified delay and drop-rate requirements for packet services. It was implemented in the [[Voice Funnel]].

Its second version, known variously as ST-II or ST2, was drafted by Claudio Topolcic and others in 1987 and specified in 1990.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;RFC 1190 (published 1990)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The final version of ST2, which was also known as ST2+, was drafted by the IETF ST2 Working group&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=IETF ST2 Working Group (Concluded March, 1996)|url=http://www.ietf.org/wg/concluded/st2.html}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=IETF ST2 Status Pages (Concluded)|url=http://tools.ietf.org/wg/st2/}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and published as RFC 1819.
ST2 distinguishes its own packets with an [[Internet Protocol]] version number 5, although it was never known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;IPv5&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;RFC 1819&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
   IP and ST packets can be distinguished by the IP Version Number field, i.e., the first four (4) bits of the packet; ST has been
   assigned the value 5 (see [RFC1700]). There is no requirement for compatibility between IP and ST packet headers beyond the first four
   bits. (IP uses value 4.)
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

ST uses the same IP address structure and the same [[link layer]] protocol number (ethertype 0x800) as IP.

There is a &amp;quot;[[datagram]] mode&amp;quot; in which ST packets can be encapsulated over IP headers using [[List of IP protocol numbers|protocol number]] 5.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/ |title=Protocol Numbers |publisher=Iana.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
