&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Dark Horse Comics]] [[limited series]] starring the fictional archaeologist [[Indiana Jones]]. It was the seventh &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Indiana Jones&amp;apos;&amp;apos; limited series by Dark Horse, and the sixth about the adult Indiana. The comic was based on a canceled [[LucasArts]] video game, a sequel to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis|Fate of Atlantis]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (which was also the first Dark Horse &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Indiana Jones&amp;apos;&amp;apos; comic).

==Plot==
The comic is set after [[World War II]], with the Nazis seeking the [[Philosopher&amp;apos;s Stone]] in an attempt to resurrect dead Nazis. Along with the beautiful Russian major Nadia, Indiana Jones gathers the pieces of the philosophers stone.

==Development==
The reasons for the cancellation included the clash between the drawing styles of the characters ([[art deco]]) and of the background (realistic), the retiring from the project of [[Aric Wilmunder]], the main programmer, and finally, the problems with distribution in [[Germany]], where [[censorship]] laws prohibit the sale of any products with explicit depictions of Nazi symbols. Earlier games could get away easily by simply removing the [[Nazism|Nazi flag]]s and references to them, but this could not be done with this game, as they were an important part of the plot and Hitler was featured as a central villain.

After this game, LucasArts briefly considered making a game named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Spear of Destiny&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (involving the spear of [[Longinus (Christian mythology)|Longinus]]). They eventually abandoned the idea of creating a classical adventure game in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Indiana Jones&amp;apos;&amp;apos; series, instead focusing on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Tomb Raider]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-style 3D action games. Thus, ending it with the release of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, followed by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Indiana Jones and the Emperor&amp;apos;s Tomb]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and another being released in 2009.

==Comic book==
Since the game, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was canceled, Dark Horse Comics released a four-part comic book series based upon it. A comic book was also created for the canceled game, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
