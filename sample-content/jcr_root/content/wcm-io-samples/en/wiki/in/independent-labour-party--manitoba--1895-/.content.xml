Before World War I, there were at least two organizations in Winnipeg calling themselves the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Independent Labour Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The first of these was set up by British trade unionists in 1895, and collapsed soon thereafter.

The second was created in 1906, following a visit to the city from [[Ramsay MacDonald]].  The party received support from members of [[Arthur Puttee]]&amp;apos;s [[Winnipeg Labour Party]], which had been moribund since 1904.

Like other groups of the same name, this Independent Labour Party was a reformist organization.  It was opposed by members of the more radical [[Socialist Party of Canada]].

The ILP nominated [[Kempton McKim]] to contest the riding of [[Winnipeg West]] in the provincial election of 1907.  McKim called for labour standards legislation and the public ownership of utilities.  He was defeated by Thomas Johnson, a popular figure from the left wing of the [[Manitoba Liberal Party|Liberal Party]].

In 1908, some members agitated for the ILP to officially declare itself as socialist.  They were opposed by another group, led by moderate reformer [[Fred Dixon]] (later a member of the provincial legislature).  The controversy split the party, which ceased to exist as a viable organization after June 1908.  The reformist faction of the ILP regrouped as the [[Manitoba Labour Party]] for the [[Manitoba general election, 1910|1910 provincial election]].

In 1914-15, candidates nominated by the [[Labour Representation Committee (in Manitoba)|Labour Representation Committee]] officially ran for the &amp;quot;Independent Labor Party&amp;quot;, even though no formal organization of that name seems to have existed at the time.
