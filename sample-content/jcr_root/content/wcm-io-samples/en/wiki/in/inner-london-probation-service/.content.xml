        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Inner London Probation Service&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; existed until 31 March 2001 when it was succeeded by the larger [[London Probation Area]]. Its final Chief Probation Officer was John Harding, later visiting professor at the [[University of Hertfordshire]]. He succeeded Graham Smith, who went on to be the Chief Inspector of Probation in [[England]] and [[Wales]] and was [[knight]]ed towards the end of his career.

At an earlier point it was known as the Inner London Probation and After Care Service.

Its boundaries were the same as [[Inner London Education Authority|ILEA]] (the Inner London Education Service) and it consisted of the 12 Inner [[London boroughs]].

A book about its early years  was written by a former employee.  It is now called the London Probation Service and includes some of the outer London Boroughs. Website /www.london-probation.org.uk/
