{{Indigenous Peoples of Canada}}
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Indian Register&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the official record of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Status [[First Nations|Indians]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Registered Indians&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Canada]]. Status Indians have rights and benefits that are not granted to [[Non-Status Indian|unregistered]] Indians, [[Inuit]], or [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]], the chief benefits of which include the granting of [[Indian reserve|reserves]] and of rights associated with them, an extended [[hunting season]], a less restricted [[right to keep and bear arms|right to bear arms]], an exemption from federal and provincial taxes, and more freedom in the management of gaming and tobacco franchises via less government interference and taxes.

==History==
In 1850 the colonial governments of [[British North America]] began to keep records of Indians and bands entitled to benefits under [[treaty]]. For 100 years, individual [[Indian agents]] made lists of members who belonged to each band. In 1951 the current Indian Register was established by amendment of the [[Indian Act (Canada)|Indian Act]], and the many band lists were combined into one.

In 1985, the Indian Act was amended again with the goal of restoring Indian status to people who had lost it through discriminatory provisions of the Act, and to their children. Over 100,000 people who had lost their status in this way have since been added to the Register.

==Indian Status==
The list is maintained by the [[Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]]. Sole authority for determining who will be registered is vested in the post of Registrar.

===Revocation of Status===
The discriminatory reasons for revoking status were:

* marrying a man who was not a Status Indian
* [[enfranchisement]] (until 1960, an Indian [[Universal suffrage|could vote]] in federal elections only by renouncing Indian status)
* having a mother and paternal grandmother who did not have status before marriage (these people lost status at 21)
* being born out of wedlock of a mother with status and a father without.

===Documentary proof of Indian Status===
Since 1956 the Canadian federal government has issued an identity document to individuals who have status under the Indian Act.&amp;lt;ref name=AANDC-FAQ-SCIS&amp;gt; Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, [http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100032383/1100100032385 Frequently Asked Questions - Secure Certificate of Indian Status], 2012-04-24 &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Traditionally these documents have been used by Aboriginals to cross the border between Canada and the United States.&amp;lt;ref name=AANDC-FAQ-SCIS/&amp;gt;
