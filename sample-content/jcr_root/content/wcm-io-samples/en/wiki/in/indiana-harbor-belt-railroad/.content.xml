The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{reporting mark|IHB}} is a [[Class III railroad]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Surface Transportation Board]], [http://www.stb.dot.gov/Decisions/readingroom.nsf/1d523df01e895e5185257497001b8880/237c8f8a53ca0f5985256b350060cb9c?OpenDocument THE BELT RAILWAY COMPANY OF CHICAGO -- TRACKAGE RIGHTS EXEMPTION -- INDIANA HARBOR BELT RAILROAD COMPANY], January 9, 2002&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; in the [[United States]].  The line comprises {{convert|320|mi|km}} of track&amp;amp;mdash;30 miles of single mainline track, {{convert|24|mi|km}} of double-main track and {{convert|266|mi|km}} of additional yard and side track&amp;amp;mdash;starting northwest of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in [[Franklin Park, Illinois]], traveling southeast around the city to its headquarters in [[Hammond, Indiana]].

The line&amp;apos;s largest yard, Blue Island, is located in [[Riverdale, Illinois]], with other yards in the [[Indiana]] cities of Hammond and [[East Chicago, Indiana|East Chicago]]. The Gibson Yard, located in Hammond, is arguably the largest auto-switching operation in the United States.

Throughout the 1970s and 1990s to the present, Indiana Harbor Belt operated an extensive [[interlocking tower]] system including: East End, Osbourne, Calumet, Gibson, Stewart Avenue, Graselli, 55th Street and Argo towers and switch tenders at North Harvey and Columbia Street in Hammond. They later took over State Line tower from the [[Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad]].
