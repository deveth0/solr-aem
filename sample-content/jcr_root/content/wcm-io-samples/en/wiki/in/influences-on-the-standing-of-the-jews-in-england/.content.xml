{{History of the Jews in England}}

==Improvement of Jewish relations==

One reason for an improvement in the public image of the Jews at the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th can be found in positive attitudes towards Jewish [[pugilist]]s. A further cause for kindlier feeling on the part of at least the [[middle class]]es of [[England|Englishmen]] toward the Jews was supplied by the revival of [[Religious conversion|conversionist]] hopes at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Misled doubtless by the tendency to desertion shown by not a few of the [[Sephardim]], many [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians anticipated the conversion &amp;apos;&amp;apos;en masse&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the Jewish population, and on the initiative of [[Lewis Way]] the [[Church&amp;apos;s Ministry Among Jewish People|London Society for the Promotion of Christianity Among the Jews]] was founded in 1809. This and kindred societies wasted large sums of money with indifferent results. But politically they helped to increase sympathy for the Jews among the [[non-conformist]]s, who formed the bulk of their contributors and were at the same time becoming a leading factor in the formation of [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] policy.

==British Israelism==
Similarly, at a much later period the craze of [[British Israelism]] made many of the narrower [[Bible]] [[Christian]]s more sympathetic toward the Jews. On the other hand, the great influence of Dr. [[Thomas Arnold]] in the Liberal ranks was ultimately directed against the Jewish hopes. The more [[Erastian]] he was, the more he desired to see the legislature exclusively Christian.

==Rise of German Jewish community==

In the meanwhile the lead among the English Jews was passing from the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish]] to the [[Ashkenazi Jews|German]] section of the community. The bankers Goldsmid acquired both influence and culture, and their efforts to raise the community were soon to be supplemented by those of [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild|Nathan Rothschild]], the ablest of [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild|Mayer Rothschild]]&amp;apos;s sons, who had settled first in [[Manchester]] and afterward in [[London]]. The times were in a measure propitious for a new effort to remove the civil [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] of the Jews. The example of [[France]] had not been without its effect. The rising tide in favour of religious liberty, as applied to dissenters generally and to [[Roman Catholic]]s in particular, might have been expected to carry with it more favourable conditions for the Jews; but a long struggle was to intervene before &amp;quot;Englishmen of the Jewish persuasion&amp;quot; were to have equal [[rights]] with other Englishmen.
