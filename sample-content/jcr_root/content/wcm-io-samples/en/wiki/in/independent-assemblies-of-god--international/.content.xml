        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Independent Assemblies of God, International&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;(IAOGI)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[pentecostal]] [[Christian]] association with roots in a revival in 1890 decade among the Scandinavian [[Baptist]] and [[Pietism|Pietist]] communities in the United States.

In 1907 most of those revived-congregations (many named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Guds forsamling&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - Assembly of God in Norsk) and individuals learned about the Pentecostal movement through [[William Howard Durham]] Mission in [[Chicago]].  One of his assistant elders, F. A. Sandgren, published the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Folke-Vennena&amp;apos;&amp;apos; a periodical for Scandinavians, and consequently many Midwest churches joined the Pentecostal movement.

This group was organized in 1918 by A. W. Rasmussen as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Scandinavian Assemblies of God in the United States of America, Canada and Foreign Lands&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The group operated under this name until 1935.  In that year, at their annual convention in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], they merged with another group named the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Independent Pentecostal Churches&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and adopted the name under which they currently operate. Later, a split over the [[latter rain movement]] led the formation of the [[Fellowship of Christian Assemblies]].

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Independent Assemblies of God, International&amp;apos;&amp;apos; believes some of the uniqueness that sets it apart from other Pentecostal bodies is &amp;quot;its conviction of the sovereignty of the local church&amp;quot;.    The IAOGI&amp;apos;s doctrinal statement reflects the following beliefs:

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Bible as the inspired and infallible Word of God;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;One God, eternally existent in three persons&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos; The virgin birth of Christ, His vicarious, atoning death, bodily resurrection, and Ascension&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Salvation through the blood of Jesus Christ&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Water baptism by immersion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos; The Lord&amp;apos;s Supper&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Divine healing through the redemptive work of Christ on the cross&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The baptism of the Holy Spirit
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The sanctification power of the Holy Spirit;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos; The second coming of Jesus Christ;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Blessed hope resurrection and translation of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and those who are alive at His coming; and The final judgment of those who have not accepted Christ as Savior, with the devil and his angels in the Lake of Fire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Independent Assemblies of God, International&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a member of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pentecostal Charismatic Churches of North America&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The IAOGI has congregations in Africa, Canada, Guatemala, India, Mexico, the Philippines, Romania, and the United States.  The churches meet in an annual convention.  International offices are located in [[Laguna Hills, California]].  There are possibly 1500 churches worldwide.
