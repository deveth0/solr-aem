&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Interstate 110&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;I-110&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a {{convert|4.1|mi|km|adj=on}} freeway spur route in [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], running south from [[Interstate 10]] to [[U.S. Route 90]].  It is one of very few places on the [[Interstate Highway System]] utilizing a [[drawbridge]].  The southbound control city is Biloxi, with a series of bridges out over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] at the southern terminus.  There is no northbound control city; the road is marked with trailblazers reading &amp;quot;TO I-10&amp;quot; instead.  It was entirely multiplexed with [[Mississippi Highway 15]], until Mississippi 15 was truncated to I-10.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}

The route of I-110 is defined in Mississippi Code Annotated ยง 65-3-3.

==Route description==
[[Image:MSi110overgulf.jpg|thumb|left|Interstate 110 bridges over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] where it meets its terminus at [[U.S. Route 90]]]]
I-110 begins at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 90#Mississippi|US 90]] on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]]. The ramps to and from US 90 eastbound pass over the Gulf of Mexico and the beach. From US 90, the ramps from eastbound US 90 and from westbound US 90 merge and the route heads north as a four-lane [[Controlled-access highway|freeway]] through residential and commercial areas, passing over a [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] railroad line. The highway comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance serving Division Street. Farther north, I-110 comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance with Bayview Avenue. After this, the freeway crosses the [[Biloxi Bay]] on a [[drawbridge]] into [[D&amp;apos;Iberville, Mississippi|D&amp;apos;Iberville]]. Here, the road comes to a [[diamond interchange]] with Rodriguez Street and continues north through areas of homes and businesses. I-110 reaches its northern terminus at a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Interstate 10 in Mississippi|I-10]], at which point the road continues north as [[Mississippi Highway 15|MS 15]]/[[Mississippi Highway 67|MS 67]].&amp;lt;ref name=MDOTmap&amp;gt;{{cite map|publisher=Mississippi Department of Transportation|title= Official Highway Map of Mississippi|year=2008|url=http://www.gomdot.com/Divisions/IntermodalPlanning/Resources/Maps/pdf/StateHighwayMapsArchive/HWY%20Map%202008%20Front.pdf|accessdate=June 3, 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;google&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;source=s_d&amp;amp;saddr=U.S.+90+%26+Interstate+110,+Biloxi,+Harrison,+Mississippi+39530&amp;amp;daddr=I-110+and+I-10&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=FWjHzwEdfIiz-ildYCwy-g6ciDHQFqM3IjXJ-w%3BFWax0AEdDZKz-inliVgnSAyciDEWob_gPIQgGw&amp;amp;mra=pd&amp;amp;sll=30.409362,-88.056224&amp;amp;sspn=1.065932,2.705383&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=13|title=overview of Interstate 110|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
