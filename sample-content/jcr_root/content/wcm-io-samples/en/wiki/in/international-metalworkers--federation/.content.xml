The organization held a congress every four years, consisting of delegates from the member organisations. The congress established the broad lines of the IMF&amp;apos;s policies and actions and elected the President and General Secretary of the IMF.

The international headquarters of IMF was based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. There were regional offices in [[Johannesburg]], [[New Delhi]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Mexico City]], and a project office in [[Russia]].

In June 2012, affiliates of IMF joined the new global federation [[IndustriALL Global Union]].
