&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Inner Wheel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an international organisation closely linked to [[Rotary International|Rotary]] that was founded to unite wives and daughters of Rotarians.

Before year 1989, Rotary generally prohibited women as members. Therefore another organisation was established for the wives and daughters of Rotarians, known as Inner Wheel. Despite women now being able to join Rotary, Inner Wheel Clubs continue in many countries.

The International Inner Wheel objectives are (a) promoting true friendship, (b) encouraging the ideals of personal service, and (c) fostering international understanding.
