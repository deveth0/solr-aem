:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This article deals with the former brewery &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Interbrew&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; before its merger into &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[InBev]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Interbrew&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a large [[Belgium]]-based brewing company which owned many internationally known beers, as well as some smaller local beers. In 2004 Interbrew merged with [[Brazil]]ian brewer [[AmBev]] to form &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[InBev]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which is the now largest brewer in the world by volume, with a 13% global market share (as of 2004) now named [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]] (2008).

Some important Interbrew brands are [[Stella Artois]], [[Boddingtons]], [[Beck&amp;apos;s]], [[Staropramen]], [[Bass Brewery|Bass]], [[Leffe]], [[Labatt]] and [[Hoegaarden Brewery|Hoegaarden]].  Before the merger with Ambev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, [[Anheuser-Busch]] was the largest, followed by [[SABMiller]] in second place. [[Heineken International]] was in fourth place and AmBev was the world&amp;apos;s fifth largest brewer.

==History==
Having its roots in [[Leuven]], Interbrew was formed in 1988 when &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Brouwerij Artois&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the [[Flanders|Flemish]] brewers of [[Stella Artois]] (already established by 1366) merged with [[Wallonia|Walloon]]-based brewer [[Piedboeuf]]. International expansion began when Interbrew acquired the notable Canadian brand [[Labatt]]. The transaction also included Labatt&amp;apos;s assets, which included the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] baseball club, the [[Toronto Argonauts]] football club, and [[The Sports Network]] (the latter being immediately resold to [[NetStar Communications]] due to Canadian media ownership regulations). The latter at the time was not much smaller than Interbrew, and since then the company had been considered a multinational with both Canadian and Belgian roots.
