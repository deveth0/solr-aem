        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Inkarri&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Inkari&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) [[myth]] is one of the most famous legends of the [[Inca]]. When the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]es tortured and executed the last ruler of the [[Inca]] people, [[Atahualpa]], he vowed that he would come back one day to avenge his death. According to the legend, the [[Spaniards]] buried his body parts in several places around the kingdom:  His head is said to rest under the Presidential [[Palace]] in [[Lima]], while his arms are said to be under the Waqaypata (Square of tears) in [[Cusco|Cuzco]] and his legs in [[Ayacucho]]. Buried under the earth he will grow until one day, when he will rise, take back his kingdom and restore harmony in the relationship between [[Pachamama]] (the earth) and her sons.

Since it has been passed on orally for many generations, several different versions of the Inkarri myth exist. The name Inkarri probably evolved from the Spanish Inca-&amp;apos;&amp;apos;rey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Inca-king).

The mythical lost city of [[Paititi]] is said to have been founded by Inkarri.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Concerning the connection of Inkarrí with &amp;quot;Paititi,&amp;quot; see &amp;quot;In Search of Paititi: Following the Road of Stone into an Unknown Peru&amp;quot; by [[Gregory Deyermenjian]], in the Spring 2006 issue of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Explorers Journal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; and &amp;quot;The Petroglyphs of Pusharo: Peru&amp;apos;s Amazonian Riddle,&amp;quot; by Gregory Deyermenjian, in the Volume 2 Number 3 (2000) issue of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Athena Review&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==In popular culture==

The legend of Inkarri is the background story and the title of a novel by [[Ryan Miller (author)|Ryan Miller]].
