&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Incitatus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the favored [[horse]] of [[Roman emperor]] [[Caligula]] (reigned 37â€“41 AD). Its name is a [[Latin]] adjective meaning &amp;quot;swift&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;at full gallop&amp;quot;.

According to [[Suetonius]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (121 AD), Incitatus had a [[stable]] of [[marble]], with an [[ivory]] manger, purple blankets, and a [[collar (animal)|collar]] of precious stones. [[Dio Cassius]] has indicated that the horse was attended to by servants, and was fed [[oat]]s mixed with [[gold]] flake. Suetonius also wrote that it was said that Caligula planned to make Incitatus a [[Roman consul|consul]], and that the horse would &amp;quot;invite&amp;quot; dignitaries to dine with him in a house outfitted with servants there to entertain such events.

==Caligula&amp;apos;s folly==
The accuracy of the received history has been questioned by [[Historical revisionism|historical revisionists]] such as Anthony A. Barrett. They suggest that later Roman chroniclers such as Suetonius and [[Dio Cassius]] were influenced by the political situation of their own times, when it may have been useful to the current Emperors to discredit the later Julio-Claudian Emperors. Also, the lurid nature of the story added spice to their narratives, winning them additional readers.

One suggestion is that Caligula&amp;apos;s treatment of Incitatus was an elaborate prank, intended to ridicule and provoke the Senate, rather than a sign of insanity, or perhaps a form of satire, with the implication that a horse could perform a Senator&amp;apos;s duties.

Barrett notes that &amp;quot;Many stories were spread about Incitatus, originating most likely from Caligula&amp;apos;s own humorous quips.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ABarrett&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=Caligula: The Corruption of Power|author= Barrett, Anthony A. |publisher=Yale University Press|year=1990|location=New Haven, CT}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Possibly out of perverted sense of humor Caligula would pour libations to Incitatus&amp;apos; Salus [health and well-being], and claimed that he intended to co-opt him as his priest.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name =&amp;quot;ABarrett&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==In art and metaphor==
Incitatus appears as an allegorical figure when referencing examples of political ineptitude. A Melbourne lawyer once remarked that Incitatus would have the numbers for premier in Victoria, and in act III of [[Chekhov]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Cherry Orchard]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1904) Pishchik says that his family is &amp;quot;descended from that very nag Caligula inducted into the Senate.&amp;quot;

[[Ayn Rand]], in her novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Atlas Shrugged]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1957), refers to Incitatus, when she says that the character Cherryl Brooks is &amp;quot;the horse of some Roman emperor.&amp;quot; Brooks is a poor dime store clerk who dates, and eventually marries, Jim Taggart, the wealthy President of Taggart Transcontinental, described as &amp;quot;one of the most powerful men in Washington.&amp;quot;

The life of Incitatus is the subject of [[Zbigniew Herbert]]&amp;apos;s poem &amp;quot;Caligula&amp;quot; (in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pan Cogito&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1974).

In [[Bill Willingham]] and [[Matthew Sturges]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Jack of Fables]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Incitatus talks so much that he risks giving away his status as a Fable and frequently mentions his former status as a Roman senator.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jack of Fables&amp;apos;&amp;apos; #22-24&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
