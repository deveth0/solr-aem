&amp;lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Spirit of Independence.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A [[personification]] of independence as represented by a [[statue]] in [[The American Adventure]] in the World Showcase pavilion of [[Walt Disney World]]&amp;apos;s [[Epcot]].]] --&amp;gt;
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Independence&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a condition of a [[nation]], [[country]], or [[Sovereign state|state]] in which its residents and population, or some portion thereof, exercise [[self-government]], and usually [[sovereignty]], over the territory. The opposite of independence is a [[dependent territory]].

Whether attainment of independence is different from [[revolution]] has long been contested, and has often been debated over the question of [[violence]] as a [[legitimacy (law)|legitimate]] means to achieving sovereignty.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |last=Benjamin |first=Walter |authorlink=Walter Benjamin |title=Walter Benjamin: Selected Writings, Volume 1: 1913-1926 |origyear=1921 |year=1996 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=236-252 |nopp=true |isbn=06-749-4585-9}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  While some revolutions seek and achieve national independence, others aim only to redistribute power &amp;amp;mdash; with or without an element of emancipation, such as in [[democratization]] &amp;amp;mdash; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;within&amp;apos;&amp;apos; a state, which as such may remain unaltered. Nation-states have been granted independence without any revolutionary acts.{{fact|date=July 2012}} The [[October Revolution|Russian October Revolution]], for example, was not intended to seek national independence; the [[United States Revolutionary War]], however, was.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Autonomous entity|Autonomy]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refers to a kind of independence which has been granted by an overseeing [[authority]] that itself still retains ultimate authority over that territory (see [[Devolution]]). A [[protectorate]] refers to an autonomous region that depends upon a larger government for its protection as an autonomous region. The dates of established independence (or, less commonly, the commencement of revolution), are typically celebrated as a national [[Public holiday|holiday]] known as an [[independence day]].

Sometimes, a state wishing to achieve independence from a dominating power will issue a [[declaration of independence]]; the earliest surviving example is [[Scotland]]&amp;apos;s [[Declaration of Arbroath]] in 1320, with the most recent example being [[Azawad]]&amp;apos;s declaration of independence in 2012. Declaring independence and attaining it however, are quite different. A well-known successful example is the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|U.S. Declaration of Independence]] issued in 1776.

Historically, there have been three major periods of declaring independence: the years from 1776 to the [[Revolutions of 1848]] in Europe; the immediate aftermath of the [[First World War]] with the breakup of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]] empires; and the decades from to 1945 to 1979, when seventy newly independent states emerged from the wreckage{{Citation needed|reason=not an impartial statement|date=June 2013}} of the European colonial empires&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://maghis.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/3/61.full The Declaration of Independence in World Context]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Organization of American Historians]],  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Magazine of History&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Volume 18, Issue 3, Pp. 61-66 (2004)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Causes for a country or province wishing to seek independence are many. Disillusionment rising from the establishment is a cause widely used in separatist movements, but it is usually severe economic difficulties that trigger these groups into action.{{fact|date=July 2012}} The means can extend from peaceful demonstrations, like in the case of the [[Indian independence movement]], to a violent [[civil war]].

== Article note ==
The dates of independence, as they have been ported into many articles from the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[CIA World Factbook]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are defined as follows:
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;For most countries, [the given date is that] when [[sovereignty]] was achieved...For the other countries, the date given may not represent &amp;quot;independence&amp;quot; in the strict sense, but rather some significant nationhood event such as the traditional founding date or the date of unification, [[federation]], [[confederation]], establishment, or fundamental change in the form of government, such as [[Successor state|state succession]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
