* First aired: 1992-11-20
* Running time: 29:42

=== Summary ===
Offbeat London comic [[Bob Mills (comedian)|Bob Mills]] presents the first of two pilot programmes.  He has gathered together music, moments from films and television series, stories, and observations on life, and discusses them with a live studio audience who &amp;amp;ndash; together with viewers &amp;amp;ndash; have been invited round to his pad for the night.

In the first programme Bob looks at the black hole that is afternoon television; unearths the moment when a contestant in Family Fortunes answered with the word &amp;quot;turkey&amp;quot; to all the questions (an incident also referred to in episode one, series one of the sitcom [[15 Storeys High]]); and takes a look at life on a London council estate.  Along the way he reflects on what has happened to such old friends as the &amp;quot;Watney&amp;apos;s Party Seven&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Aztec&amp;quot; chocolate bars, Clyde Best, and &amp;quot;Crimplene&amp;quot;.

Former punk favourites [[The Buzzcocks]] provide the live music with &amp;quot;What do I Get&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ever Fallen in Love&amp;quot;.
