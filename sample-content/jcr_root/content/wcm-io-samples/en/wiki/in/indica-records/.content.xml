        text="&lt;p&gt;{{Advert|date=January 2013}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Indica Records&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Canadian]] [[record label]] based in [[Montreal, Quebec]], founded by rock band [[Grim Skunk]] in [[1997 in music|1997]]. The label was put together by the band, manager Simon Gallipeault, label manager Kyria Kilakos and  head of promo Mariana Gianelli, following the demise of the band&amp;apos;s former label [[Cargo Records (Canada)|Cargo Records]]. Indica is considered to be the biggest &amp;quot;alternative&amp;quot; label in Quebec.  After Gallipeault&amp;apos;s death following a skateboarding accident, GrimSkunk singer Franz Schuller took the helm as president of the company. Indica Records  was started with $2000; a grassroots, do-it-yourself approach; and an overriding belief in &amp;quot;artist first&amp;quot; vision.

Armed with the mandate of supporting independent releases for great touring bands lacking label support in Canada, Indica has since grown by leaps and bounds and has expanded its repertoire to encompass a variety of genres beyond the rock/punk/alternative music on which the label was founded, including folk, pop, indie, world and electro-rock.

The company&amp;apos;s vision has not wavered, however. It finds artists with a great attitude, songwriting and originality.
