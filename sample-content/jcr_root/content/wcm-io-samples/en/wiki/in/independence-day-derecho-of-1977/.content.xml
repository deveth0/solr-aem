&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Independence Day Derecho of 1977&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[derecho]], or long-lived windstorm associated with a fast-moving band of thunderstorms, that occurred in the northern [[Great Plains]] of the U.S. on [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]], 1977. It lasted around 15½&amp;amp;nbsp;hours. The derecho formed in [[Minnesota]] around 10 a.m. CDT on July 4 and became more intense around noon in the central part of the state. The derecho produced winds of 80-100&amp;amp;nbsp;mph (130–160&amp;amp;nbsp;km/h) in northern [[Wisconsin]] felling thousands of trees in the northern part of the state.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/AbtDerechos/casepages/jul41977page.htm |title=The Independence Day Derecho of 1977 |accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Wisconsin==
As the storm raced through [[Burnett County, Wisconsin|Burnett]], [[Washburn County, Wisconsin|Washburn]], [[Sawyer County, Wisconsin|Sawyer]], [[Price County, Wisconsin|Price]], and [[Oneida County, Wisconsin|Oneida]] counties, it caused a band of damage 10–20&amp;amp;nbsp;miles (15–30&amp;amp;nbsp;km) wide. Nearly 850,000 [[acre]]s (3,400&amp;amp;nbsp;km²) of forest were badly damaged or destroyed. The derecho caused $24M property damage. One person was killed and 35 were injured.

Here is a summary of damage by county:
* [[Sawyer County, Wisconsin]] - A wind gust of 75&amp;amp;nbsp;mph (120&amp;amp;nbsp;km/h) was measured at the Hayward airport. The downburst winds destroyed several homes and barns. Winds of 135&amp;amp;nbsp;mph (220&amp;amp;nbsp;km/h) were estimated at the Flambeau River State Forest. A woman was killed when a tree fell on her camper at [[Connors Lake]]. Nearby, an area of old-growth forest was almost completely destroyed.
* [[Price County, Wisconsin]] - The storm continued to damage several homes and injured 20&amp;amp;nbsp;people. The gust front reached [[Phillips, Wisconsin|Phillips]] around 2:55 p.m. CDT and the severe winds lasted for 25 minutes. An [[anemometer]] at the airport registered a 100&amp;amp;nbsp;mph (160&amp;amp;nbsp;km/h) wind gust. All the homes in the Phillips area were damaged. Thirty were damaged beyond repair.
* [[Oneida County, Wisconsin]] - The derecho continued to damage homes and blow down large areas of forest. The gust front entered [[Rhinelander, Wisconsin|Rhinelander]] around 3:30 p.m. CDT. A wind speed of 115&amp;amp;nbsp;mph (185&amp;amp;nbsp;km/h) was recorded at the airport. Seven people were injured in this county. The severe winds continued through northeastern Wisconsin and across [[Lake Michigan]].

==Michigan==
The derecho was not nearly as strong in Michigan as it was in Wisconsin. Many trees blew over and caused damage to homes and buildings as it moved into [[Manistee, Michigan|Manistee]] and [[Ludington, Michigan|Ludington]]. The storm spawned tornadoes as it moved into central Lower Michigan and two people were injured—one from an overturned mobile home and another from an overturned camper.

The derecho moved through Lower Michigan throughout the afternoon and evening  before dissipating in northern [[Ohio]] around 1:30 a.m. EDT on July 5. A total of 1&amp;amp;nbsp;million acres (4,000&amp;amp;nbsp;km²) of forest were damaged or destroyed, and the storm caused a total of $30M damage (1977&amp;amp;nbsp;dollars).

==Bow Echo discovered==
After the storm, [[Tetsuya Theodore Fujita|Dr. T. Theodore Fujita]] became aware of the extreme wind damage over northern Wisconsin and decided to conduct an investigation. He noticed that there were three areas of extreme damage from northeastern Minnesota to extreme northwestern Wisconsin, and then two more areas of forest blowdowns extending from [[Hayward, Wisconsin|Hayward]] to [[Rhinelander, Wisconsin|Rhinelander]].

He then went back and looked at the [[radar]] echos, and he noticed that they evolved into a bow signature. It was during this investigation that Dr Fujita discovered the [[bow echo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;bow&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;spearhead radar echo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]].
