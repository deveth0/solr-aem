&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Independence Stadium&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a stadium owned by the city of [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] and is the home of the [[Independence Bowl]].

Formerly known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;State Fair Stadium&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, it is the site of the annual [[Independence Bowl]] post-season [[college football]] game, initially ([[1976 in sports|1976]]) the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bicentennial Bowl&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  Before that, it was the home venue of the [[Shreveport Steamer]] of the short-lived [[World Football League]] (1974–75).  It also served as a neutral site for the annual [[Arkansas–LSU football rivalry]] from 1925–1936.

The stadium is also host to numerous high school football games and soccer matches, since many schools in Shreveport lack an on-campus facility. Independence Stadium also hosted the [[Louisiana High School Athletic Association|LHSAA]] state football championship games in 2005 after the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Louisiana Superdome]] suffered heavy damage from [[Hurricane Katrina]].

In 1994–95, Independence Stadium was home to the [[Shreveport Pirates]] of the [[Canadian Football League]], which was undergoing US expansion at the time.

In the late 1990s, the stadium capacity was expanded from approximately 40,000 to 50,832.
In 2005, to meet accommodations of the upcoming Independence Bowl in 2006, the stadium went through a renovation to extend the capacity from 52,000 to 59,000. Then in 2008, the City of Shreveport created an entire new section of the stadium. This portion would allow the stadium capacity to be expanded only if need be. This expanse put the total capacity at 63,000.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.worldstadiums.com/north_america/countries/united_states/louisiana.shtml]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This was part of a grander upgrading plan that improved all aspects of the facility, from concourses to playing surface.

Independence Stadium was considered as a possible playing site for the [[New Orleans Saints]] during the 2005 [[National Football League]] season due to [[Hurricane Katrina]], but Shreveport eventually lost out to the [[Alamodome]] in [[San Antonio]], Texas, and [[Louisiana State University]]&amp;apos;s [[Tiger Stadium (Baton Rouge)|Tiger Stadium]] in [[Baton Rouge]]. However, Independence Stadium eventually was chosen to host the Saints&amp;apos; first preseason home game for the 2006 season while the [[Louisiana Superdome]] prepared for its grand re-opening. [[Field Turf]] was installed on the stadium&amp;apos;s playing surface in 2010.

In 2010, a Texas UIL playoff game was played featuring Mesquite Horn HS and the technical host Longview.  Longview won, 28–14.

In 2011, Independence Stadium hosted the inaugural year of the annual Port City Classic, an NCAA college football competition between [[Louisiana Tech University]] of Ruston, Louisiana, and [[Grambling State University]] of Grambling, LA.

The south end zone of the stadium borders [[Interstate 20]].
