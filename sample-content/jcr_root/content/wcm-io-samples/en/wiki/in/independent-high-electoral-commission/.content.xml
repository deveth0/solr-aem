The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Independent High Electoral Commission&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ar|المفوضية العليا المستقلة للانتخابات}}; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;IHEC&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is [[Iraq]]&amp;apos;s electoral commission. The electoral commission is headed by a nine member board.  Seven of those members are voting and must be Iraqi citizens. The other two members are the Chief Electoral Officer and an outside expert appointed by the [[United Nations]].

==History==

It was set up in May 2004 by the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA) as the Independent Election Commission of Iraq (IECI) by CPA Order 92 as the exclusive electoral authority in Iraq to begin work towards holding an election in the country. In 2007 the IECI was renamed the Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) in accordance with Law 11 (2007) of the [[Council of Representatives of Iraq]] (COR).

In the 2005 election the expert was Colombian [[Carlos Valenzuela]]. The current Chief Electoral Officer is [[Adil Lami]]. The commission set up and ran the January [[Iraqi legislative election, January 2005|2005 Iraqi legislative election]] as well as the simultaneous elections for provincial governments and the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]].

==Procedure==

Little is known about the commission, its procedures, organization, composition, or acts. The commission receives lists of candidates to ban from the [[Council of Representatives of Iraq|Council of Representatives]] [[Accountability and Justice Commission]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news | title= Iraqi Panel Moves to Bar Sunni From March Election: Move Made to Bar Iraqi From Ballot | last1= Bakri | first1= Nada | last2= Shadid | first2= Anthony | publisher= [[New York Times]] | date= 7 January 2010 | url= http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/08/world/middleeast/08iraq.html}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news | title= Move to ban candidates sparks political crisis in Iraq | last1= Karadsheh | first1= Jomana | last2= Bassil | first2= Yousif | publisher= [[CNN]] | date= 4 February 2010 | url= http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/02/04/iraq.candidate.ban/}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news | title= Election Ruling in Iraq Favors Prime Minister as Crisis Grows | last1= Myers | first1= Steven Lee | publisher= [[New York Times]] | date= 26 April 2010 | url= http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/world/middleeast/27iraq.html}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
