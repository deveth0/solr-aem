The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;International Association of Universities&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;IAU&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO)-based worldwide association of higher education institutions. It brings together institutions and organisations from some 120 countries for &amp;quot;reflection and action on common concerns and collaborates with various international, regional and national bodies active in [[higher education]].&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The complete Mission Statement is available at http://www.iau-aiu.net/association/index.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

IAU is based in [[Paris]] and is located at the headquarters of UNESCO. However, it is an independent organization.

== Leadership ==
In 2008, the General Assembly of IAU elected [[Juan Ramon de la Fuente]], former Rector of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] as its President, for the 2008-2012 term.

The General Executive Secretary is Eva Egron-Polak, former International Vice President at the [[Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada]].
