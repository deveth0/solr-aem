The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Indo-Iranian languages&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Aryan]] languages&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN3110161133&amp;amp;id=KFBDGWjCP7gC&amp;amp;pg=PA221&amp;amp;lpg=PA221&amp;amp;vq=aryan+languages&amp;amp;dq=aryan+languages+iranian&amp;amp;sig=11bYU5iUtJpZx-Ct7VdMBvOjG_c |title=Numeral Types and Changes Worldwide, by Jadranka (EDT) Gvozdanovic, Language Arts &amp;amp; Disciplines,1999, Page 221 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-02}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; constitute the easternmost extant branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. It is also the largest branch, with more than 1 billion speakers stretching from [[Europe]] ([[Romani language|Romani]]) and the [[Caucasus]] ([[Ossetic language|Ossetian]]) eastward to [[Xinjiang]] ([[Sarikoli language|Sarikoli]]) and [[Assam]] ([[Assamese language|Assamese]]) and south to [[Sri Lanka]] ([[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]]).

==Languages==
Indo-Iranian consists of three groups:
*[[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]
*[[Iranian languages|Iranian]]
*[[Nuristani languages|Nuristani]]

The largest in terms of native speakers are [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] (Hindiâ€“Urdu, ca. 240 million), [[Bengali language|Bengali]] (205 million), [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] (100 million), [[Marathi language|Marathi]] (75 million), [[Persian language|Persian]] (60 million), [[Pashto language|Pashto]] (ca. 50 million), [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] (50 million), [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] (20 million), [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]] (40 million), [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]] (40 million), [[Maithili language|Maithili]] (35 million), [[Oriya language|Oriya]] (35 million), [[Marwari language|Marwari]] (30 million), [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] (25 million), [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]] (20 million), [[Chhattisgarhi language|Chhattisgarhi]] (18 million), [[Assamese language|Assamese]] (15 million), [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] (16 million), and [[Rangpuri language|Rangpuri]] (15 million).

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ethnologue&amp;apos;&amp;apos; lists two unclassified Indo-Iranian languages: [[Luwati language]] and [[Badeshi language]]. The latter has not been confirmed to exist.

==History==
Indo-Iranian languages were once spoken across a still wider area. The [[Scythians]] were described by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writer [[Strabo]] as inhabiting the lands to the north of the [[Black Sea]] in present-day [[Ukraine]], [[Moldova]] and [[Romania]]. The river-names [[Don River (Russia)|Don]], [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]], [[Danube]] etc. are possibly of Indo-Iranian origin. The so-called [[Migration Period]] saw Indo-Iranian languages disappear from Eastern Europe, apart from the ancestors of Ossetian in the Caucasus, with the arrival of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking [[Pechenegs]] and others by the 8th century AD.

Sanskrit was widely spoken throughout [[Southeast Asia]] from 7th century onwards  due to Indian trade and [[Greater India|colonization]].

The oldest attested Indo-Iranian languages are [[Vedic Sanskrit]] (ancient Indo-Aryan), Older and Younger [[Avestan language|Avestan]] and [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] (ancient Iranian languages). A few words from a fourth language (very closely related to Indo-Aryan; see [[Indo-Aryan superstrate in Mitanni]]) are attested in documents from the ancient [[Mitanni]] kingdom in northern Mesopotamia and Syria and the [[Hittites|Hittite]] kingdom in Anatolia.
