        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Interlude of Youth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an English 16th-century [[morality play]].[http://web.viu.ca/siemensr/www/teaching/tudorlyric362/youth.htm] It is one of the earliest printed morality plays to have survived. Only two or three copies of any edition are known to exist. Waley&amp;apos;s edition of the work appeared probably about the year [[1554 in literature|1554]], and has a woodcut on the title-page of two figures, representing Charity and Youth, two of the characters in the interlude. Another edition was printed by [[William Copland]], and has also a woodcut on the title-page, representing Youth between Charity, and another figure which has no name over its head. The colophon is: &amp;quot;Imprinted at London, in Lothbury, over against Sainct Margarytes church, by me, [[Wyllyam Copland]].&amp;quot; A fragment of a [[black-letter]] copy of the interlude has survived at [[Lambeth Palace]].
