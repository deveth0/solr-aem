&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Internal sin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in Christianity, is the idea that [[sin]] may be committed not only by outward deeds but also by the inner activity of the mind, quite apart from any external manifestation. [[Thought crime]]s were as old as [[heresy]], but the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]&amp;apos;s alarms received new emphasis at the [[Council of Trent]] (Session XIV, chapter. v). The session, while reiterating that all [[mortal sin]]s must be confessed, singled out the unspoken ones that &amp;quot;sometimes more grievously wound the soul and are more dangerous than sins which are openly committed&amp;quot;.

Three kinds of internal sin are usually distinguished by [[Catholicism|Catholics]]:
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;delectatio morosa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the pleasure taken in a sinful thought or imagination even without desiring it;
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;gaudium&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, dwelling with complacency on sins already committed;
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;desiderium&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the desire for what is sinful.

== Biblical quotes==
* [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:28 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
* [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 6:12 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
