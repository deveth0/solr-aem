The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ingrian War&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; between [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]], which lasted between 1610 and 1617 and can be seen as part of Russia&amp;apos;s [[Time of Troubles]], is mainly remembered for the attempt to put a Swedish duke on the Russian throne. It ended with a large Swedish territorial gain in the [[Treaty of Stolbovo]] which laid an important foundation to Sweden&amp;apos;s [[Rise of Sweden as a Great Power|Age of Greatness]].

== Prelude ==

During Russia&amp;apos;s [[Time of Troubles]], [[Charles IX of Sweden]] sent an expeditionary corps under [[Jacob De la Gardie]] to capture the Russian fortress of [[Old Ladoga]]. On hearing about their arrival to [[Ingria]], the [[Novgorod]]ians asked the king to install one of his sons — [[Charles Philip, Duke of Södermanland|Carl Filip]] or [[Gustavus II Adolphus|Gustavus Adolphus]] — as their monarch and on this understanding submitted the city to De la Gardie.

[[Vasily IV of Russia]], besieged in [[Moscow]] by the [[Tushino]] gang and driven to despair by the [[Dymitriads|ongoing Polish intervention]], then entered an alliance with Charles IX, who was also [[Polish-Russian War (1605-1618)|waging war against Poland]]. The tsar promised to cede [[Korela Fortress]] to Sweden in recompense for military support against [[False Dmitry II]] and the Poles. Thereupon De la Gardie joined his forces with the Russian commander [[Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky]] and marched from Novgorod towards [[Moscow]] in order to relieve the tsar.

Sweden&amp;apos;s involvement into the Russian affairs gave [[Sigismund III Vasa]] a pretext to declare [[Dymitriads|war on Russia]]. The Poles engaged the combined Russo-Swedish forces [[Battle of Klushino|at Klushino]] and destroyed most of the Russian force; the Swedish mercenaries taking part in the [[De la Gardie Campaign]] (July 1610) surrendered. The battle had serious consequences for Russia, as the tsar was deposed by [[boyar]]s and the Poles occupied [[the Kremlin]].

== Fighting ==

In the meantime, Gustavus Adolphus succeeded to the Swedish throne. The young king decided to press his brother&amp;apos;s claim to the Russian throne even after the Poles had been expelled from Moscow by a patriotic uprising of 1612 and [[Mikhail Romanov]] had been elected a new tsar.

While the Swedish statesmen envisaged the creation of a Trans-Baltic dominion extending northwards to [[Archangelsk]] and eastwards to [[Vologda]], De la Gardie and other Swedish soldiers, still holding Novgorod and Ingria, saw the war as a reaction for their forces not receiving payment for their succour during the [[De la Gardie Campaign]].

In 1613 they advanced towards [[Tikhvin]] and laid a siege to the city, but were repelled. The Russian counter-offensive failed to regain Novgorod, however. The Russian tsar refused to commit his troops to battle and the war lumbered on until 1614, when the Swedes captured [[Gdov]].

The following year they laid siege to [[Pskov]] but Russian generals Morozov and Buturlin held their own until 27 February 1617, when the [[Treaty of Stolbovo]] stripped Russia of its access to the [[Baltic Sea]] and awarded to Sweden the province of [[Duchy of Ingria|Ingria]] with the townships of [[Ivangorod]], [[Kingisepp|Jama]], [[Koporye]] and [[Shlisselburg|Noteborg]]. Novgorod and Gdov were to be restituted to Russia.

As a result of the war, Russia was [[Landlocked|denied access to the sea]] for about a century, despite its persistent efforts to reverse the situation.
