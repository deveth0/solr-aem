        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Interior Gateway Routing Protocol&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;IGRP&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[distance-vector routing protocol|distance vector]] [[Interior Gateway Protocol|interior routing protocol (IGP)]] invented by [[Cisco Systems, Inc.|Cisco]]. It is used by [[Router (computing)|router]]s to exchange [[routing]] data within an [[autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]].

IGRP is a [[proprietary protocol]].  IGRP was created in part to overcome the limitations of [[Routing Information Protocol|RIP]] (maximum hop count of only 15, and a single routing metric) when used within large networks. IGRP supports multiple metrics for each route, including [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], [[Network delay|delay]], [[Load (computing)|load]], [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]], and [[Reliability (computer networking)|reliability]]; to compare two routes these metrics are combined together into a single metric, using a formula which can be adjusted through the use of pre-set constants. The maximum hop count of IGRP-routed packets is 255 (default 100), and routing updates are [[Broadcasting (computing)|broadcast]] every 90 seconds (by default).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2/ip/configuration/guide/1cfigrp.html Cisco Systems] Configuring IGRP&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; IGRP uses [[port number]] 9 for communication.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web

IGRP is considered a [[Classful network|classful]] routing protocol. Because the protocol has no field for a [[subnet mask]], the router assumes that all subnetwork addresses within the same Class A, Class B, or Class C network have the same subnet mask as the subnet mask configured for the interfaces in question. This contrasts with classless routing protocols that can use [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing|variable length subnet masks]]. Classful protocols have become less popular as they are wasteful of [[IPv4 address exhaustion|IP address space]].

==Advancement==
In order to address the issues of address space and other factors, Cisco created [[EIGRP]] (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).  EIGRP adds support for [[VLSM]] (variable length subnet mask) and adds the [[Diffusing Update Algorithm]] (DUAL) in order to improve routing and provide a loopless environment.  EIGRP has completely replaced IGRP, making IGRP an obsolete routing protocol.  In Cisco IOS versions 12.3 and greater, IGRP is completely unsupported. In the new Cisco [[CCNA]] curriculum (version 4), IGRP is mentioned only briefly, as an &amp;quot;obsolete protocol&amp;quot;.
