        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;International Socialists&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-da|Internationale Socialister}}) is a [[Trotskyist]] organisation in [[Denmark]].

IS was set up in 1984 as split from the [[Left Socialists]]. It is part of the [[International Socialist Tendency]] led the by the British [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]]. The International Socialists are mainly involved in activities aiming at organising students. When [[ATTAC]] was founded in Denmark, IS worked with the organisation. Later on IS members pulled out of ATTAC claiming that the organisation had no substance. As an organisation closely connected to the British Socialist Workers Party IS has a similar, if not identical approach on the [[Iraq War|Iraq]] issue, i.e. giving the various [[Iraqi insurgency|resistance movements of Iraq]] unconditional but tactical support. The Danish media has attracted attention on IS because of this issue.

At its congress in March 2006 IS decided to collectively join the broader [[Red-Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red-Green Alliance]]. IS will however maintain its own organisation and keep publishing its monthly &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Socialistisk Arbejderavis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
