&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;International Consumer Research &amp;amp; Testing (ICRT)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a global [[consortium]] of more than 40 [[consumer organisation]]s dedicated to carrying out joint research and testing in the consumer interest.

ICRT’s principal objectives are to facilitate [[co-operation]] between its members and to promote research and testing in the field of consumer [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|service]]s.

==ICRT Tests==
ICRT members co-operate in a programme of continuous testing on a wide range of popular consumer products such as [[digital camera]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, [[television set]]s, [[car]]s, [[washing machine]]s, [[dishwasher]]s, [[vacuum cleaner]]s and [[light bulb]]s.

In addition, there are numerous other smaller collaborative tests, on a whole range of consumer products from [[anti-wrinkle cream]]s to [[athletic shoe]]s.

[[Safety]] has always been a topic of concern to consumer organisations. ICRT members have played a key role in promoting higher safety standards for consumer goods.

ICRT also facilitates information exchange and testing between members in areas such as [[food]], [[health]], the [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[financial service]]s.

ICRT members join forces with [[motor club]]s with the aim of testing cars, [[tyre (wheel)|tyre]]s and [[infant car seat]]s. ICRT is a key player in [[European New Car Assessment Programme]] (Euro NCAP) and a similar programme in [[Latin America]].

==ICRT Members==

All ICRT member organisations act exclusively in the consumer interest. They do not accept [[advertising]] and are independent of [[commerce]], [[industry]] and [[political party|political parties]].

Member organisations range in size from the largest consumer organisations worldwide with memberships between 200,000 and 7 million to smaller organisations with less than 10,000 members.

ICRT’s major members are: [[Which?]] ([[United Kingdom]]), [[Consumers Union]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Consumer Reports]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[United States of America]]), [[Stiftung Warentest]] ([[Germany]]), Association des Consommateurs &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Test Achats]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Belgium]]), Union Fédérale des Consommateurs - [[UFC Que Choisir|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Que Choisir&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] ([[France]]), [[Consumentenbond]] ([[Netherlands]]). ICRT has member organisations in [[Europe]], [[Asia Pacific]], [[Latin America]] and [[Africa]].

[[Werner Brinkmann]] is the German member of the [[Board of directors|Board]] of ICRT.

ICRT works closely with the two other international campaigning consumer organisations, to which many ICRT members also belong:
* [[BEUC]] - the European Consumers&amp;apos; Organisation
* CI - [[Consumers International]]

==History==
ICRT was formally set up as a not for profit association under [[United Kingdom]] law in 1990 but it is based on a long tradition of co-operation between independent consumer organisations since the 1960s.

* 1968 – The first joint tests between the Dutch and Belgian organisations included [[hairdryer]]s, dishwashers, [[stereo receiver]]s and [[model trains]]. A test of hotels in [[Majorca]] was also joined by Germany.
* 1972 – The name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;European Testing Group&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ETG) was adopted.
* 1974 – By now twelve organisations were attending ETG meetings including those from The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, UK, France, [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]].

* 1990 – A new organisation – &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;International Consumer Research &amp;amp; Testing&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was created to formalise the arrangements of the ETG.
* 1991 – First European Commission (EC)-funded project “Comparative Testing in Europe” completed. This laid the basis for discussion about future ICRT EC-funded comparative testing projects.
* 1992 – First ICRT Guidelines issued
* 1995 – ICRT became a founder member of the Euro NCAP crash test programme
* 1999 – [[Guido Adriaenssens]] appointed CEO. ICRT now has 26 members
