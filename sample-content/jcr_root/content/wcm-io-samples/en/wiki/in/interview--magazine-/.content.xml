&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Interview&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[United States|American]] [[magazine]] which has the nickname &amp;quot;The Crystal Ball Of Pop&amp;quot;. It was founded in late 1969 by artist [[Andy Warhol]]. The magazine features intimate conversations between some of the world&amp;apos;s biggest celebrities, artists, musicians, and creative thinkers.  Interviews are usually unedited or edited in the eccentric fashion of Warhol&amp;apos;s books and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In the early days, complimentary copies of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Interview&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were often given away to the &amp;quot;in-crowd&amp;quot;; this was the start of the magazine&amp;apos;s circulation, which hovers around 230,000.  Toward the end of his life, as Warhol withdrew from everyday oversight of his magazine, a more conventional editorial style was introduced under editor [[Bob Colacello]]).  However, Warhol continued to act as ambassador for the magazine, distributing issues in the street to passersby and creating &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ad hoc&amp;apos;&amp;apos; signing events on the streets of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].

The magazine&amp;apos;s format has remained consistent at 60% features and 40% glossy advertising. It has been published since shortly after Warhol&amp;apos;s death in 1987 by Brant Publications, Inc.  It was helmed for 18 years by Ingrid Sischy, until she and [[Peter Brant]]&amp;apos;s ex-wife Sandra became lovers and left the magazine, selling Ms. Brant&amp;apos;s half-ownership stake in the parent company Brant Publications.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Ingrid Sischy and Sandra Brant to Helm ‘Vanity Fair’ Abroad|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/03/ingrid_sischy_and_sandra_brant.html|accessdate=15 October 2012|newspaper=New York Magazine|date=17 March 2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  For a year and a half the magazine was in flux, edited by [[Christopher Bollen]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Management Changes at Interview Magazine|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/business/media/20interview.html|accessdate=15 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 July 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It &amp;quot;relaunched&amp;quot; under Co-Editorial Directors [[Fabien Baron]] and [[Glenn O&amp;apos;Brien]] in September 2008, with an iconic cover featuring [[Kate Moss]].  Stephen Mooallem and Christopher Bollen serve as the working editor-in-chief and editor-at-large, respectively. The publication&amp;apos;s content can be found online and via an [[Application software|app]], Other Edition, available on iTunes.

The magazine is currently featured in [[The CW]]&amp;apos;s television series, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Carrie Diaries (TV Series)|The Carrie Diaries]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a prequel to [[HBO|HBO&amp;apos;s]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sex and the City]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The protagonist, played by actress, [[AnnaSophia Robb]], vicariously explores [[New York City]] through the glamorous Fashion Editor of Interview, played by [[Freema Agyeman]].
