&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Inline skating&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[sport]] practiced widely internationally.  Inline skates typically have 2 to 5 [[polyurethane]] wheels, arranged in a single line. The in-line design allows for greater speed{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} than [[roller skates]] and better maneuverability.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The in-line wheels coupled with boots designed for skating of various obstacles. Inline-skating is practiced and performed using [[inline skates]] designed for race tracks, [[skate park]]s, [[Urban areas]], and off-road.

Inline skating is also known as &amp;quot;roller blading&amp;quot; due to the popular brand of inline skates, [[Rollerblade]].

==Disciplines==

{{main|Vert Skating}}
Is a term used to refer to riding [[inline skates]] on a [[Vert Ramp]], a half pipe with some vertical in it usually between 6in to 24in. [[Vert skating]] is a form of [[gymnastics]] performed with skates. The purpose of vert skating is to ride higher than the coping (which is the metal pipe on top of the ramp) and perform spins or flips. It focuses on complicated aerial maneuvers, such as spins and flips. The intent of the skater is to build speed until they are of sufficient height above the edge of the ramp to perform various aerial acrobatics. In competitions skaters have limited time, often less than a minute, to impress the judges by landing numerous and difficult tricks. The sport was included in the first X-Games in 1995. [[Vert Skating]] is used in a lot of competitions such as the [[X Games]]. [[Vert Ramps]] are also present in most skateparks of today.
