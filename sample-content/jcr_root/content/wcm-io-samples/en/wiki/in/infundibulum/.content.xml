* Lungs: The [[alveolar sacs]] of the lungs, from which the air chambers (alveoli) open, are  also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;infundibula&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
*Avian lungs: the tubular extension from the atrium which continues to form air capillaries is called &amp;apos;&amp;apos; infundibulum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
* Nose: The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ethmoidal infundibulum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the most important of three infundibula of the nose: the frontal infundibulum and the maxillary infundibulum flow into it.
* Ovary: The [[Infundibulum of uterine tube]] is the funnel-like end of the mammal oviduct nearest to the ovary.

==Veterinary medicine==
* Tooth: In horses, other equines and ruminants, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Infundibulum (tooth)|infundibulum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of a tooth is the central cup or funnel of [[tooth enamel|enamel]] and [[cementum]].

* In the fantasy novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Little, Big&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by John Crowley, the character Theodore Bramble considers &amp;quot;a peculiar geography I can only describe as infundibular&amp;amp;nbsp;... I mean by this that the other world is composed of a series of concentric rings, which as one penetrates deeper into the other world, grow larger. The further in you go, the bigger it gets.&amp;quot;
