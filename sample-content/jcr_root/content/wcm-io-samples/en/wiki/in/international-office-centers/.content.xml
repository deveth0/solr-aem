The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;International Office Centers Corporation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was on the 79th Floor of Building One of New York&amp;apos;s [[World Trade Center]].  They provided temporary [[office]] space for remote, new and international companies on a month-to-month basis.  Additionally, they also supplied secretarial, receptionist, faxing and copying services as well as other traditional administrative services.

As they were on the 79th Floor of Building One, on [[September 11th, 2001]], many of their tenants as well as their employees were killed when terrorists flew a hijacked plane into the side of the Tower.
