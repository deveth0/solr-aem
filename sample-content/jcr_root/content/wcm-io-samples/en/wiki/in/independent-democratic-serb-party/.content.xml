The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Independent Democratic Serb Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-hr|Samostalna demokratska srpska stranka, SDSS}}, {{lang-sr|Самостална демократска српска странка}}) is a [[Social democracy|social democratic]] political party of [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs living in Croatia]].

==History==
It was formed in 1997 as a liberal/social-democrat party said to be based on the doctrine of [[Svetozar Pribićević]]&amp;apos;s [[Independent Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Independent Democratic Party]] from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].

The party is led by [[Vojislav Stanimirović]] and aims to facilitate the return of [[Serb]] [[refugees]] who in 1995, in the face of [[Operation Storm]], fled Croatia. Operation Storm was a military operation in which the Croatian military and police took the main part of the self-proclaimed [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]], thus establishing Croatian government control up to and including the [[Republic of Croatia]]&amp;apos;s internationally recognized boundaries.

In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2003]], it beat its main rival, the [[Serb People&amp;apos;s Party (Croatia)|Serb People&amp;apos;s Party]] (SNS), taking all three seats reserved for Serb representatives in the Croatian parliament.

After the elections, the Independent Democratic Serb Party made an agreement with the winning HDZ party ([[Croatian Democratic Union]]) led by [[Ivo Sanader]] in which they agreed on fulfilling several SDSS demands such as refugee return, strengthening of national equality, judicial reform and cooperation with neighbouring countries.

In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2007]], they retained their three seats in the Parliament. In the [[Cabinet of Ivo Sanader II]], their member [[Slobodan Uzelac]] received the position of vice-president of government.

In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2011]], they again won their three seats in the Parliament on the Serbian minority electoral list. They do not participate in the [[Cabinet of Zoran Milanović]].

==Self-definition==
The SDSS is a democratic party of liberal and social democratic orientation, but in the present circumstances, it is also a Serb national party.

Political goals:

#Refugee return, especially of Serbs; finishing renewal of war damaged areas
#The right to buy earlier state-owned flats, under earlier legislation (before peaceful reintegration of Croatian Podunavlje, when deadline for buying state-owned flats ended)
#State protection and securing of existing rights of national minorities, especially [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs in Croatia]]
#Cultural and educational autonomy of Serbs in Croatia, through use of [[Serbian language]] and writings, use of Serbian [[Flag of Serbia|national symbols]], education in Serbian, foundation of Serb organizations in education and culture, foundation of Serbian information media and the maintaining of Serbian traditions and customs
#Professionalization of the armed forces
#Regionalism and decentralization
#Croatian integration into the EU and developing economic relations with [[Serbia]]
