        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Integral Equations and Operator Theory&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Academic journal|journal]] dedicated to [[operator theory]] and its applications to [[engineering]] and other [[mathematics|mathematical sciences]]. As some approaches to the study of [[integral equations]] (theoretically and numerically) constitute a subfield of operator theory, the journal also deals with the theory of integral equations and hence of [[differential equation]]s. The journal consists of two sections: a main section consisting of refereed papers and a second consisting of short announcements of important results, open problems, information, etc.  It has been published monthly by Springer-Verlag since 1978.  The journal is also available online by subscription.
