[[Image:International Standard Payload Rack drawing.gif|thumb|International Standard Payload Rack]]
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;International Standard Payload Rack&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ISPR&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) has been adopted by the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) program to support efficient integration and interchangeability of payload hardware &amp;amp;ndash; and to maximize joint research among investigators. The 37 ISPR slots for science payloads on ISS provide a common set of interfaces regardless of location. Nonstandard services are also provided at selected locations to support specific payload requirements.

==Capabilities==
Each ISPR provides 1.571&amp;amp;nbsp;m³ (55.5&amp;amp;nbsp;ft³) of internal volume being about 2&amp;amp;nbsp;m (79.3&amp;amp;nbsp;in) high, 1.05&amp;amp;nbsp;m (41.3&amp;amp;nbsp;in) wide, and 85.9&amp;amp;nbsp;cm (33.8&amp;amp;nbsp;in) deep. The rack [[weight|weighs]] 104&amp;amp;nbsp;kg (230&amp;amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lbm]]) and can accommodate an additional 700&amp;amp;nbsp;kg (1540&amp;amp;nbsp;lbm) of payload equipment. The rack has internal mounting provisions to allow attachment of secondary structure. The ISPRs will be outfitted with a thin center post to accommodate sub-rack-sized payloads, such as the 483&amp;amp;nbsp;mm ([[19-inch rack]]) [[Spacelab]] Standard Interface Rack (SIR) Drawer or the [[Space Shuttle]] Middeck Locker. Utility pass-through ports are located on each side to allow cables to be run between Racks. Module attachment points are provided at the top of the rack and via pivot points at the bottom. The pivot points support installation and maintenance. Tracks on the exterior front posts allow mounting of payload equipment and [[laptop]] [[computer]]s. Additional adapters on the ISPRs are provided for ground handling.

==Compatibility==
The International Standard Payload Rack is too big to fit through the Russian probe and drogue docking system, [[Androgynous Peripheral Attach System|APAS]], or [[International Low Impact Docking System|NDS]] docking systems, and therefore cannot be transferred directly from a [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]], [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]], [[Space Shuttle]], or [[Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle|Orion]] to the ISS.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
In the past ISPRs were delivered in [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]]s, which were carried in the Space Shuttle cargo bay and berthed to [[Common Berthing Mechanism|CBM]] ports.  {{As of|2011}} they can only be delivered using the Japanese [[H-II Transfer Vehicle]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/10/iss-prepares-busy-upcoming-year-logistics-operations/|title=ISS Prepares for Busy Upcoming Year of Logistics Operations|last=Harding|first=Pete|date=2010-10-20|publisher=Nasaspaceflight|quote=Bay one can carry four International Standard Payloads Racks (ISPRs), than can be removed from the HTV and transferred to the ISS.|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Other ISPR systems==
[[Japan]] has developed an ISPR with interfaces and capabilities nearly identical to NASA&amp;apos;s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
