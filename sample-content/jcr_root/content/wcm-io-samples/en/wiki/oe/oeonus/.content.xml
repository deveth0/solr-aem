:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;For the [[genus]] of [[grass skipper]] [[butterflies]], see &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Oeonus (butterfly)]].

In [[Greek mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oeonus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a son of [[Licymnius]] who accompanied [[Hercules]].  He was killed in [[Sparta]] in Hercules&amp;apos;s company.  Hercules had promised Licymmius that he would bring back his son, and so, when Oeonus died, Hercules burned his body and took the ashes back to the father.  This is supposed to be the origin of the Greek practice of [[cremation]].
