Baker Company&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a mercantile and grocery company based in [[Fort Benton, Montana]], started by Isaac Gilbert Baker and his brother, George Amos Baker, as I. G.

Calgary: Univ. Alberta Press, 2002.&amp;quot; Ch 2 is about the Conrads &amp;amp; I. G. Baker &amp;amp; Co., but ch. 1 &amp;amp; 3 are also pertinent.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  After the Conrad brothers (Charles E. &amp;amp; Wm. G.) were admitted as partners in 1873, the company name was changed to I. G. Baker &amp;amp; Co., which name was retained after the Conrads purchased George Bakerâ€™s interest in 1874.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;k1&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; In 1891, the Canadian assets of the company were purchased by its chief rival there, the [[Hudson&amp;apos;s Bay Company]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbc.com/hbcheritage/history/places/stores/calgary.asp|title=HBC Heritage - Our History - Places: Calgary|work=[[Hudson&amp;apos;s Bay Company]]|accessdate=2009-05-17|quote=In 1891 the Company bought out the Canadian assets of I.G.
