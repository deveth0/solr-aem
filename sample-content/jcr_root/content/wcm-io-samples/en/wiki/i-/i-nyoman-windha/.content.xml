        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;I Nyoman Windha&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of the leading musicians and contemporary composers of [[Bali]]nese [[gamelan]] music. He was born at Banjar Kutri, Singapadu, Gianyar, [[Bali]]. A graduate of the National Institute of Arts ([[Institut Seni Indonesia Denpasar|ISI]]) in [[Denpasar, Bali]], Windha has been a member of the faculty since 1985.  He has composed dozens of compositions for Balinese gamelan in many genres but primarily in [[kebyar]] style. His compositions, such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Puspanjali&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1989), have been incorporated into the standard repertoire of Balinese performing groups and many have won awards at Bali&amp;apos;s annual gamelan competition.

Windha&amp;apos;s music is known for his beautiful melodies, incorporation of forms and styles from Javanese gamelan, and other innovations such as use of [[time signature|3/4 time]].  He has traveled and taught extensively around the world.
