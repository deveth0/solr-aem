&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;I packed my bag&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[car game]]. One person says &amp;quot;I packed my bag and in it I put...&amp;quot;, followed by any object they like in the traditional version of the game. The next person then says &amp;quot;I packed my bag and in it I put...&amp;quot;, followed by the original suggestion, and adding their own. A player is disqualified if they forget one of the previously occurring items or can not think of a new item to add to the bag. The game continues until all but the winner has been disqualified.

A typical list might end up something like: &amp;quot;I packed my bag and in it I put a PSP, a PS3, a TV, High-End PC, Gabe Newell, a C# program that can divide by zero, death metal t-shirts, a house, stolen bicycle, my pet mouse, a bar of health.&amp;quot;

A common variation of the game is that the items listed must be in [[alphabet]]ical order, so the first person would need to choose an object beginning with A, the second person&amp;apos;s object would begin with B, and so on.

Other variations involve using a scenario other than packing the bag. For example, &amp;quot;I went to the [[zoo]] and saw...&amp;quot; following the same rules as either of the above variants.
