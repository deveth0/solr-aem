==Reviews==
&amp;quot;[[Susan Hayward]] sings for the first time on the screen, and will win much applause for her throaty voice in such songs as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sing, You Sinners (song)|Sing, You Sinners]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[When the Red, Red Robin (Comes Bob, Bob, Bobbin&amp;apos; Along)]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,  and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[I&amp;apos;m Sitting on Top of the World]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. She is supported by [[Ray Danton]] as the man whose death first upsets her; by [[Jo Van Fleet]] as her domineering mother who realises what she has done too late; Richard Conte, Eddie Albert and Don Taylor.&amp;quot; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Picture Show&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, June 23, 1956 &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
