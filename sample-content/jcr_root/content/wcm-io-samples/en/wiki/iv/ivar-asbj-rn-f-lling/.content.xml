&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ivar Asbjørn Følling&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1888–1973) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[physician]] and [[biochemist]] who first described the disease named after him—Følling&amp;apos;s disease—which is better known outside of Norway as [[phenylketonuria]] or, for short, [[Phenylketonuria|PKU]]. He was born in Kvam, [[Steinkjer]].

==Life==

Følling studied [[chemistry]] at The [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] in [[Trondheim]] and graduated in 1916. He then went to the Kristiania University in [[Oslo]], graduating in medicine in 1922.
He received his medical doctorate (somewhat like a PhD in Medicine) in 1929 after doing postgraduate work in Norway and abroad (in [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[Vienna]] and the [[U.S.]]). Starting in 1932 Følling occupied a series of medical posts in Oslo, culminating in his being Professor of Biochemistry and Physician-in-Chief at the central laboratory at the [[Rikshospitalet]], which is the Norwegian national research hospital. He retired in 1958.

==Discovery==

In 1934 at [[Rikshospitalet]], Dr. Følling saw a young woman named Borgny Egeland. She had two children, Liv and Dag, who had been normal at birth but subsequently developed mental retardation. When Dag was about a year old, the mother noticed a strong smell to his urine. Dr. Følling obtained urine samples from the children and, after many tests, he found that the substance causing the odor in the urine was phenylpyruvic acid. The children, he concluded, had excess phenylpyruvic acid in the urine, the condition which came to be called [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU).

This abnormal condition reflects an inability to break down the [[amino acid]] [[phenylalanine]] due to an hereditary deficiency of the necessary [[enzyme]] which is called [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]].

Today a screening blood test for PKU is done on newborns to detect the disease. With a special diet low in phenylalanine, PKU newborns can grow and develop into normal children and adults.

==Perspective==

Dr. Følling&amp;apos;s brilliant work was too late to save Liv and Dag from severe progressive [[mental retardation]] (and in Dag&amp;apos;s case, death) but it has saved thousands of children since then.

It has been said that: &amp;quot;Følling is by many considered the most important medical scientist not to receive the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.&amp;quot;[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2400.html]
