&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ivan Antonovich Kupreyanov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Ива́н Анто́нович Купрея́нов}}; 1800–1857), also spelled in English as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kupreanof&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was the head of the [[Russian-American Company]] in [[Russian America]] from 1835 to 1840.  He built the famous residence, library and museum in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] called Baranof&amp;apos;s Castle by early American settlers, who assumed that it had been built by [[Alexandr Baranov]], Kupreyanov&amp;apos;s predecessor by eighteen years.  The residence was the site of the ceremony in which [[Alaska Purchase|control]] of Russian America was transferred from Russia to the United States in 1867.  Although the residence fell down in 1897, the hill where is was located is still called Castle Hill.

Kupreyanov and his wife, Yuliya Ivanovna, began a school for native girls in Sitka.  It was closed at the end of his administration but was reopened later.

==Legacy==
[[Kupreanof Island]] in the [[Alexander Archipelago]] (the [[Alaska Panhandle]]) was named after him, and indirectly the city of [[Kupreanof, Alaska]], which is on that island.
