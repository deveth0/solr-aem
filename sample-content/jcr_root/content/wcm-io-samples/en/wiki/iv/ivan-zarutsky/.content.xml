&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ivan Martynovich Zarutsky&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Заруцкий, Иван Мартынович&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Russian language|Russian]]) (died 1614) was a [[Cossack]] leader in [[Russia]] in the early 17th century.
==Biography==
In 1606–1607, [[ataman]] Zarutsky and his men took part in the [[Bolotnikov Uprising]]. After [[Ivan Bolotnikov]]&amp;apos;s defeat on the outskirts of [[Moscow]], Zarutsky went to [[Poland]] to take the side of &amp;quot;tsar Dmitry&amp;quot; ([[False Dmitriy II|False Dmitri II]]) and [[Poland|Polish]] king [[Sigismund III Vasa]]. Zarutsky played an important role in creating the military for False Dmitri II and took part in all of his battles, for which he would be given the title of a &amp;quot;[[boyar]]&amp;quot;.

After the death of the [[impostor]], Zarutsky married Dmitri&amp;apos;s widow [[Marina Mniszech]] and set the goal to install her son Ivan on the Russian [[throne]]. In January 1611, Zarutsky joined the First People&amp;apos;s Volunteer Army, which had been fighting with the Polish invaders in Moscow under the command of [[Prokopy Lyapunov]]. Zarutsky organized Lyapunov&amp;apos;s [[assassination]] and became the leader of the army; however, most of the [[service class people]] left it after that. Zarutsky was left with a scanty unit of the Cossacks, who couldn&amp;apos;t struggle successfully in small numbers. The leader of the Second People&amp;apos;s Volunteer Army, [[Dmitry Pozharsky]], urged the people to unite and not to recognize the authority of Marina Mniszech, her son and Zarutsky. After an unsuccessful attempt to kill Pozharsky, Zarutsky had to flee to [[Astrakhan]] due to the [[desertion]] of his supporters and People&amp;apos;s Army&amp;apos;s advancement towards Moscow. In 1614, the people of Astrakhan decided that Zarutsky and his [[clique]] didn&amp;apos;t meet their interests and organized an uprising against him. Zarutsky fled to the [[Ural (region)|Ural]] [[steppe]]s, where he, Marina Mniszech and her son Ivan would be caught by the Cossacks and handed over to the government.

Zarutsky and Marina Mniszech&amp;apos;s little son [[Tsarevich Ivan Dmitriyevich|Ivan]] were executed in Moscow in 1614. Marina Mniszech soon died in [[prison]].
