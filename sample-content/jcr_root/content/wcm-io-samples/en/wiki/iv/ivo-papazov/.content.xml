Ivo Papasov was born to a [[Romani people|Gypsy]] family &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ivo_papasov.mondomix.com/en/artiste.htm|date=30 March 2003|publisher=Mondomix: Le magazine des musiques et cultures dans le monde |title=Ivo Papazov|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070507002224/http://ivo_papasov.mondomix.com/en/artiste.htm|archivedate=7 May 2007|deadurl=yes}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web|title=Ivo Papazov|publisher=Mondomix: Le magazine des musiques et cultures dans le monde|url=http://www.mondomix.com/e/ivo_papasov}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; in Bulgaria and his original name is Ibrahim (Turkish name). As a result of the extensive programme of forced nationalisation of ethnic minority groups during Bulgaria&amp;apos;s socialist rule, Papazov changed his first name to Ivo (adapted from Ibo, short for Ibrahim). He speaks Turkish and comes from [[Kardzhali]], a city close to Bulgaria’s Turkish and Greek borders. He grew up in a musical family and followed the Balkan Gypsy tradition of leaving school at a young age to focus on playing music for a living.
