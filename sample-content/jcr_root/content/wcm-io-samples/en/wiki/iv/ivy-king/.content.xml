&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ivy King&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the largest pure [[nuclear fission|fission]] [[nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]] ever tested by the United States. The bomb was tested during the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] administration as part of [[Operation Ivy]]. This series of tests involved the development of very powerful nuclear weapons in response to the nuclear weapons program of the [[Soviet Union]].

The production of Ivy King was hurried so it would be ready if its sister project, [[Ivy Mike]], failed in its attempt to achieve a [[Nuclear fusion|thermonuclear reaction]]. The Ivy King test actually took place two weeks after Mike. Unlike the Mike bomb, the Ivy King device could theoretically have been added to United States&amp;apos; nuclear arsenal because it was designed to be air-deliverable.

On November 16, 1952 at 11:30 local time (23:30 GMT) a [[Convair B-36|B-36H bomber]] dropped the bomb over a point 2,000 feet (610 m) north of Runit Island in the [[Enewetak]] atoll, resulting in a 500 [[TNT equivalent|kiloton]] explosion at 1,480 feet (450 m). The [[tropopause]] height at the time of the detonation was about 58,000 feet (11&amp;amp;nbsp;mi). The top of the King cloud reached about 74,000 feet (14.01&amp;amp;nbsp;mi) with the mushroom base at about 40,000 feet (7.6&amp;amp;nbsp;mi).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;OPERATION IVY. Project 7.5. Dispersion of Gaseous Debris from Nuclear Explosions; Philip W. Allen, DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE WASHINGTON DC. Defense Technical Information Center, 1985.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The Ivy King bomb, designated as a [[Mark 18 nuclear bomb|Mk-18 bomb]] and named the &amp;quot;Super Oralloy Bomb&amp;quot;, was a modified version of the [[Mark 6 nuclear bomb|Mk-6D bomb]]. Instead of using an [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion type weapon|implosion system]] similar to the Mk-6D, it used a 92 point implosion system initially developed for the Mk-13. Its [[uranium]]-[[plutonium]] [[plutonium core|core]] was replaced by 60&amp;amp;nbsp;kg of [[Enriched uranium|highly enriched uranium (HEU)]] fashioned into a thin-walled sphere equivalent to approximately four [[Critical mass (nuclear)|critical masses]]. The thin-walled sphere was a commonly used design which ensured that the fissile material remained sub-critical until imploded. The HEU sphere was then enclosed in a natural uranium [[tamper]]. To physically prevent the HEU sphere collapsing into a critical condition if the surrounding explosives were detonated, or if the sphere was crushed following an aircraft accident, the hollow centre was filled with a [[Link chain|chain]] made from [[aluminum]] and [[boron]] which was pulled out to arm the bomb. The boron coated chain also absorbed the [[neutron]]s needed to drive the nuclear reaction.

The primary designer of the Super Oralloy Bomb, physicist [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Ted Taylor]], later became a vocal proponent of [[nuclear disarmament]].
