&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ivo Van Damme&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (21 February 1954 &amp;amp;ndash; 29 December 1976) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] middle distance runner.

Van Damme was born in [[Dendermonde]].&amp;lt;ref name=Ivo&amp;gt;{{cite news | title=À 22 ans, Ivo est entré dans l&amp;apos;Olympe | newspaper=Le Soir | date=30 August 2006}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He played [[football (soccer)|football]] until he was 16, but then switched to [[athletics (sport)|athletics]]. His breakthrough came in 1973, when he placed fourth in the 800 m at the European Junior Championships.

He suffered from [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]] the following season, but returned strong beating [[Roger Moens]]&amp;apos;s 1955  national 800 m record. In 1976, he won the European indoor title over this distance, and was one of the favourites for a medal at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]]. He eventually ended up second in both the 800 and 1500 m, finishing behind [[Alberto Juantorena]] and [[John Walker (runner)|John Walker]], respectively.

These were his last successes, as Van Damme was killed in a car accident later that year while travelling home from [[Marseille]] in southern France. He was to marry [[Rita Thijs]] in 1977.&amp;lt;ref name=Ivo /&amp;gt; Since 1977, a memorial competition has been held in Brussels to remember him, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Memorial van Damme]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It has become one of the major track and field meetings of the season.

After his death, Belgian athletics entered a long period without athletes with international fame. Together with the athletics event named after him, this turned Van Damme into a national icon and a reminder of a glorious past and missed opportunity. It was not until the arrival of [[Kim Gevaert]] and [[Tia Hellebaut]] that Belgian athletics got a boost again.
