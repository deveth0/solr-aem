He is the Sadie Dernham Patek Professor in Humanities, Professor of [[Linguistics]], and Director of the Symbolic Systems Program&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://symsys.stanford.edu/ssp_people?group=Administration Symbolic Systems Program&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; at [[Stanford University]]. A fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[Linguistic Society of America]], in 2005 he received the LSA&amp;apos;s Fromkin Prize&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.lsadc.org/info/lsa-award-more.cfm#fromkin2005] Linguistic Society of America Honors and Awards page&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; for distinguished contributions to the field of linguistics.

Sag has made notable contributions to
the fields of syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and language processing.
His early work was as a member of the research teams that invented and
developed [[HPSG]] as well as [[generalized phrase structure grammar]],
HPSG&amp;apos;s immediate intellectual predecessor.
Sag&amp;apos;s current research primarily concerns
constraint-based, lexicalist models of grammar, and their relation to
theories of language processing.
He is the author or coauthor of 10 books and over 100 articles.

Sag received his PhD from [[MIT]] in 1976, writing his dissertation (advised by [[Noam Chomsky]]) on ellipsis. He received an MA from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he studied comparative [[Indo-European languages]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[sociolinguistics]], and a BA from the [[University of Rochester]].
