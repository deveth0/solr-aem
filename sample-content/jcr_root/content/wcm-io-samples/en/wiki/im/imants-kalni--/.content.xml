&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Imants Kalniņš&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 26 May 1941 in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]])&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gramata21.lv/users/kalnins_imants/ |title=Imants Kalniņš |language=Latvian |publisher=gramata21.lv |date=July 2000 |accessdate=2010-04-01}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; is one of the most important [[composer]]s in the history of [[Music of Latvia|Latvian music]]. Having studied [[classical music|classical]], as well as [[choir|choral]] music, he has written six [[symphony|symphonies]], several [[opera]]s (including the first [[rock opera]] in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ei, jūs tur!&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hey, you there!&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)), [[oratorio]]s, [[cantata]]s, [[choir]] songs, a lot of [[film score|movie]] and [[musical theater|theater]] music. However, he is generally best known for his [[Rock and roll|rock]] songs and is to be considered the first composer of intellectual rock music.

During the 1960s, Kalniņš led the [[Liepāja]] rock band 2xBBM, which was extremely loved because of its heartfelt songs and [[hippie|hippy]]-like lifestyle. Kalniņš became the symbol of the spirituality, rebellion and worldview of the generation, and it was emphasized by the fact the band was forced to stop playing because of the pressure from official institutions. However, this doesn&amp;apos;t stop the music of Kalniņš from being heard - it is played by the incredibly popular band [[Menuets]] (Latvian for &amp;apos;[[minuet]]&amp;apos;), which plays songs almost exclusively by Kalniņš.

During the 1970s, Kalniņš returned to writing symphonic music. In 1984, he wrote the rock oratorio &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kā jūra, kā zeme, kā debess&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Like the sea, like the earth, like the sky&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) together with [[Juris Kulakovs]] and [[Juris Sējāns]]. The oratorio was the first thing played by the band [[Pērkons (band)|Pērkons]] (&amp;apos;Thunder&amp;apos;) for the general public. With it Kalniņš returned to [[rock and roll]] once more. He wrote many new songs for Pērkons, and these same songs led him to start his own band, Turaidas Roze (&amp;apos;The Rose Of Turaida&amp;apos;). However, the band never gained the recognition and adoration that Menuets and Pērkons did.

During the [[Singing Revolution|third awakening]] of the Latvian people, when [[Latvia]] regained independence, Kalniņš took part actively in [[Popular Front of Latvia|Tautas Fronte]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Popular Front&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) political organization, which played the most important part in ending Latvia&amp;apos;s occupation by the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].

The festival most associated with Kalniņš is the [[Imantdienas]] (&amp;apos;The Days of Imants&amp;apos;), extremely popular during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times and therefore banned. The tradition was reintroduced in 1995, and since then has happened every year (with the exception of 1997, when the composer was away on a trip, and 2009 – in the time of economical downturn). It has remained at least as popular as before.

Lately Imants Kalniņš has been working together with the well-known Latvian musician [[Ainars Mielavs]], and their collaboration has resulted in some of the most excellent albums containing primarily music by Kalniņš, such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Par lietām, kas tā ar&amp;apos; nekad nepāriet&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;About things that never truly go away&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (1997), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Es redzēju sapnī&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;I Saw in a dream&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (1998) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;I Love You&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1999; despite the title, the lyrics are mostly in Latvian in this album).

In 2000, music for the 1973 movie &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pūt, vējiņi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Blow, wind, blow&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was re-recorded by the [[Liepāja Symphony Orchestra]] as well as many recognized singers.

Kalniņš also composed the song &amp;quot;Pilsētā, kurā piedzimst vējš&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;In the city where the wind is born&amp;quot;), the anthem of Liepāja.

Imants Kalniņš has been one of the most loved composers in Latvian music for the past half century, and his phenomenon is showing no sign of fading.

He is also a politician, member of the 8th and 9th [[Saeima]] for [[For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK]].
