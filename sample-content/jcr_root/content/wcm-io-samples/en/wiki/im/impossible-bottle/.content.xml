An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;impossible bottle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a type of [[mechanical puzzle]]. It is a bottle that has an object inside it that does not appear to fit through the mouth of the bottle.

The [[ship]] in a bottle is a traditional type of impossible bottle. Other common objects used include [[matchbox]]es, [[deck of cards|decks of cards]], [[tennis ball]]s, [[racketball]]s, [[Rubik&amp;apos;s Cube]]s, [[padlock]]s, [[knot]]s, and [[scissors]].

==Ship in a bottle==

There are several ways to put a ship inside a bottle. The simplest way is to rig the [[Mast (sailing)|mast]]s of the ship and raise it up when the ship is inside the bottle. Masts, spars, and sails are built separately and then attached to the hull of the ship with strings and hinges so the masts can lie flat against the deck. The ship is then placed inside the bottle and the masts are pulled up using the strings attached to the masts.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|last=Lardas |first=Mark |url=http://www.boyslife.org/hobbies-projects/projects/2459/raise-the-sails/ |title=September 2006 Boys&amp;apos; Life magazine |publisher=Boyslife.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shipbottle.ru/english/how/ |title=how to section |publisher=Shipbottle.ru |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The hull of the ship must still be able to fit through the opening.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/ship-in-a-bottle-2 |title=How is a ship in a bottle made? |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Bottles with minor distortions and soft tints are often chosen to hide the small details of the ship such as hinges on the masts.

Alternatively, with specialized long-handled tools, it is possible to build the ship inside the bottle.

==Pine cone in a bottle==
This variation of the impossible bottle takes advantage of the fact that [[conifer cone|pine cone]]s open as they dry out. In constructing the display, a closed, damp cone of suitable size is inserted into a narrow-mouthed bottle and then allowed to dry inside the bottle.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/pine-cones-in-a-bottle |title=Pine Cone in the Bottle Display |publisher=Instructables |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Fruit and vegetables in a bottle==
Fruits and vegetables inside bottles are grown by placing a bottle around the blossom or young fruit and securing it to the plant. The fruit then grows to full size inside the bottle.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.scienceprojectideas.co.uk/grow-apples-tomatoes-bottles.html Science Fair Project Ideas: Grow Apples or Tomatoes in Bottles]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Penny in a bottle==
A [[Penny (United States coin)|US one-cent coin]] sealed inside a small bottle is a common souvenir. They are mass-produced using [[glassblowing]] techniques, by placing a coin inside a semi-molten glass cup, and then reshaping the open end into a narrow neck and mouth, completing the bottle. Non-metallic objects need to be protected from the hot glass to prevent scorching.
