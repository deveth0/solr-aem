The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Immortalist Society&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Charitable organization|charitable]] [[501(c)(3)]] organization devoted to [[research]] and [[education]] in the areas of [[cryonics]] and [[life extension]]. It was incorporated as a Michigan corporation by [[Robert Ettinger]] and five other local residents on June 27, 1967 as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cryonics Society of Michigan, Inc.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In September 1976 the name of the corporation was changed to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cryonics Association&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in acknowledgement that its scope of operations was not limited to a single state. On October 20, 1985 the Articles of Incorporation were amended once more to change the name to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Immortalist Society&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Organization==
All Officers of the Immortalist Society are also Directors. As of May 2008, the Immortalist Society officers were:

{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;
|-
| &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;President&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; || York Porter
|-
| &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vice-President&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; || John Bull
|-
| &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Secretary&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; || Royse Brown
|-
| &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Treasurer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; || John Besancon
|}

==Operation==
Every two months the Immortalist Society publishes its flagship journal &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Long Life: Longevity through Technology&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (formerly &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Immortalist&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), which is sent free to Members of the [[Cryonics Institute]], but must be paid for by subscribers or Immortalist Society Members who do not join the Cryonics Institute. It is also available online for free. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Long Life&amp;apos;&amp;apos; covers not only the activities of the Cryonics Institute, but activities of the [[American Cryonics Society]] and [[life extension]] news. Published six times per year, the magazine presents news, book reviews, technical articles, biographies, conference reports and other articles of interest to members.

The Immortalist Society  is particularly supportive of the work of the [[Cryonics Institute]]. Donations to the Immortalist Society Research Fund are given to finance the research of Dr. Yuri Pichugin, the full-time Russian [[cryobiology|cryobiologist]] employed by the [[Cryonics Institute]] to develop [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] mixture, improve [[perfusion]] protocol and find formulations to minimize cold [[ischemia]] (a concern for [[organ transplant]]ation). Dr.&amp;amp;nbsp;Pichugin resigned from the Cryonics Institute in December&amp;amp;nbsp;2007.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web
