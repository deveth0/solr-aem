        text="&lt;p&gt;The Crown of England traditionally exercised the right to impose import duties for the regulation of trade and the protection of domestic industry. New &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;impositions&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of this kind were imposed by [[Elizabeth I]] on currants and tobacco (1601) and extended by [[James I of England|King James I]] to most imports (1608) after a favourable ruling in [[Bates&amp;apos; Case]] (1606).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;James I, Christopher Durston, 1993&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; John Bates was a merchant from the [[Levant Company]] who refused to pay the import duty on currants, this was taken to the [[Court of the Exchequer]], he lost and so impositions were extended giving the treasury a &amp;quot;windfall&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Coming of the Civil War&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=David|title=The Coming of the Civil War, 1603 - 49|publisher=Heinemann|year=2000|series=Heinemann Advanced History |pages=30|chapter=2 James I&amp;apos;s reign 1603 - 25 |isbn=0-435-32713-5}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the face of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]&amp;apos;s angry protests in 1610, the tax was amended to ensure that the greatest impact fell on foreign merchants.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Stuart Age, 1603-1714&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, by [[John Wroughton]]. Pages 151-152&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Impositions were among the [[prerogative]] rights that King James I was to give up under the [[Great Contract]] of 1610, as drawn up by [[Lord Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], then [[Lord Salisbury]], in return for an immediate sum to pay off Royal debt and an annual subsidy that would greatly increase income.  However negotiations fell through; mainly because both sides kept changing what they wanted out of the Contract.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Coming of the Civil War&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=David|title=The Coming of the Civil War, 1603 - 49|publisher=Heinemann|year=2000|series=Heinemann Advanced History |pages=33|chapter=2 James I&amp;apos;s reign 1603 - 25 |isbn=0-435-32713-5}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
