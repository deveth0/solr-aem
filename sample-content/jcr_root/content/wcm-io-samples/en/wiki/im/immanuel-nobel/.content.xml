&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Immanuel Nobel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  (1801&amp;amp;ndash;1872), the younger, was a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] engineer, architect, inventor and industrialist. He was the inventor of the rotary [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]] used in [[plywood]] manufacturing. He was a member of the [[Nobel family]] and the father of [[Robert Nobel]], [[Ludvig Nobel]] and [[Alfred Nobel]]. He also often experimented with nitroglycerin with his sons, which led to his son, [[Emil Oskar Nobel]]&amp;apos;s, death because of an explosion at his father&amp;apos;s factory [[Heleneborg]] in [[Stockholm]] in 1864.

Nobel moved to Russia from Sweden in 1838, to sell his inventions in [[St. Petersburg]], where he lived for two decades with his family. Among his successful creations was an improved version of an underwater exploding [[naval mine|mine]] that personally interested [[Tsar Nicholas I]] of Russia. Immanuel founded a war supplies factory, Fonderies et Ateliers Mécaniques Nobel Fils, which turned out to be a very profitable business. However, the death of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] in 1855 and the end of the [[Crimean War]] in 1856 brought about a shift in Russian policies and the new [[Tsar Alexander II]] ordered a severe cut in the military budget that eventually placed Immanuel&amp;apos;s company in serious economic difficulties. In 1859, the technical management of Nobel Fils was passed to Immanuel&amp;apos;s son Ludvig and the former returned to Sweden. In 1862, Immanuel&amp;apos;s firm was finally sold by his creditors.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;LeVine, S: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Oil and the Glory&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, page 16.
