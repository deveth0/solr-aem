&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Experiment&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[schooner]] in the [[United States Navy]] during the [[Quasi-War]] with France.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Experiment&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was built in 1799 at [[Baltimore]], Maryland; and first put to sea late in November 1799, Lieutenant [[W. Maley]] in command.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Experiment&amp;apos;&amp;apos; joined the squadron commanded by Captain [[Silas Talbot]] on the [[Santo Domingo]] station, and for seven months, cruised against French [[privateer]]s in the [[Caribbean]], taking a number of valuable prizes. On 1 January 1800, while becalmed in the [[Bight of Leogane]] with a convoy of four merchantmen, [[Action of 1 January 1800|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Experiment&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was attacked by 11 armed pirate boats]], manned by about four or five hundred buccaneers. In the seven hours of fighting that followed, the pirates boarded one of the merchantmen, killing her captain, and towed off two other ships of the convoy after their crews had abandoned them. But &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Experiment&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sank two of the attacking craft, and killed and wounded many of the pirates, suffering only one man wounded.

Arriving in the [[Delaware River]] early in July 1800, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Experiment&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refitted, and returned to the [[West Indies]]. Again successful in her patrols against the French, she captured several armed vessels, one of which was carrying a high-ranking army officer. She also recaptured a number of American merchantmen, and in January 1801 rescued 65 [[Spain|Spaniards]] from the ship &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eliza&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, wrecked on a reef of the island of [[Saona Island, Dominican Republic|Saona]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Experiment&amp;apos;&amp;apos; returned to [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] early in February 1801, and was laid up there until August, when she sailed to Baltimore. There, she was sold in October 1801.
