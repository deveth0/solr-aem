The third &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boston&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a 32-gun wooden-[[hull (watercraft)|hull]]ed, three-[[Mast (sailing)|masted]] [[frigate]] of the [[United States Navy]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boston&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was built by [[public subscription]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] under the Act of 30 June 1798. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boston&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was active during the [[Quasi-War]] with [[France]] and the [[First Barbary War]]. On 12 October 1800, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boston&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[USS Boston vs Berceau|engaged and captured the French corvette &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Berceau&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boston&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was laid up in 1802, and considered not worth repairing at the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]]. She was burned at the [[Washington Naval Yard]] on 24 August 1814 to prevent her capture by British forces.

==Design and Construction==

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boston&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was designed and constructed by [[Edmund Hartt]] at [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boston&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was authorized by the [[Act of 30 June 1798]] funded by the donations from the people of Boston, Massachusetts as part of the group of ships built by the states to supplement the [[Original six frigates of the United States Navy]] provided by the [[Naval Act of 1794]].

The frigate measured 400 [[long tons|t]] with a total length of 134 ft. She was originally armed with twenty-four 9-pounder and eight 6-pounder guns, and carried a complement of 220 officers and men. She was launched on 20 May 1799 and commissioned soon afterwards, Captain [[George Little (naval officer)|George Little]] in command.

==Service history==
Boston cruised in the [[West Indies]] (July 1799 – June 1800) protecting American commerce against [[France|French]] [[privateer]]s. Returning to Boston 25 June 1800, she cruised along the American coast until September when she sailed to the [[Guadeloupe]] Station in the West Indies. In {{coord|22|52|N|52|56|W|}}, on 12 October 1800, she [[USS Boston vs Berceau|engaged and captured]] the French corvette [[French corvette Berceau (1794)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Berceau&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boston&amp;apos;&amp;apos; lost seven killed and eight wounded in the encounter. She towed her prize to Boston, arriving in November. During her West Indian cruises Boston captured seven additional prizes (two in conjunction with {{USS|General Greene|1799|6}}).

During the winter of 1801 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boston&amp;apos;&amp;apos; carried [[Robert Livingston (1746–1813)|Minister Livingston]] to [[France]] and then joined the [[Mediterranean Squadron (United States)|Mediterranean Squadron]] off [[Tripoli]] while under the command of Captain Daniel McNeill. [[Action of 16 May 1802|She fought an action]] with six or seven Tripolitanian [[gunboat]]s on 16 May 1802, forcing one ashore. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boston&amp;apos;&amp;apos; returned to Boston in October 1802 and then proceeded to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] where she was laid up. Considered not worth repairing on the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]], she remained at Washington until 24 August 1814 when she was burned to prevent her falling into British hands.
