The fourth &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Enterprise&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[United States Navy]] [[schooner]].

She was launched by the [[New York Navy Yard]] on 26 October 1831, and commissioned on 15 December 1831, Lieutenant [[S. W. Downing]] in command. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Enterprise&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sailed on 12 January 1832 for [[South America]] where she patrolled the [[Brazil Station]] guarding United States&amp;apos; interests until April 1834. Returning to New York at that time, she repaired and refitted until July when she departed again for [[Brazil]].

Ten months later she joined sloop {{USS|Peacock|1828|2}} for a cruise to the [[Far East]] by way of [[Africa]], [[India]] and the [[East Indies]]. Continuing eastward, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Enterprise&amp;apos;&amp;apos; called at [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], in September 1836, then proceeded to the west coast of [[Mexico]], arriving at [[Mazatlán]] on 28 October 1836. She cruised the west coast of South America until March 1839 when she departed [[Valparaíso]], [[Chile]] to round the Horn, call at [[Rio de Janeiro]], and sail on to Philadelphia. Here she was inactivated on 12 July 1839.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Enterprise&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was recommissioned 29 November 1839 and on 16 March 1840, sailed from New York for South America. After four years of protecting U.S. commerce on this station, she turned north for home. On 20 June 1844, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Enterprise&amp;apos;&amp;apos; entered the [[Boston Navy Yard]] and four days later was decommissioned for the last time. She was sold 28 October 1844.
