&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;J. Fred Talbott&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DD-156)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, named for [[Joshua Frederick Cockey Talbott]] (1843â€“1918), Representative from Maryland Second District from 1879 to 1885, from 1893 to 1895 and again from 1903 to 1918, was a [[Wickes class destroyer|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wickes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] [[destroyer]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Talbott&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was laid down by the [[William Cramp and Sons|William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company]] at [[Philadelphia]] in [[Pennsylvania]] on 8 July 1918, launched on 14 December 1918 by Mrs. Robert L. Bates, niece of Representative Talbott and commissioned on 30 June 1919, [[Commander]] [[T. G. Ellyson]] in command.

==Service history==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;J. Fred Talbott&amp;apos;&amp;apos; departed [[Newport, Rhode Island]] 10 July for the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], where she acted as a station ship at various ports providing an element of stability in [[Europe]] during the first troubled months of postwar adjustment and reconstruction. Upon her return to the United States 21 June 1920, the ship took part in [[Neutrality Patrol]] duty on the East Coast and engaged in fleet exercises before decommissioning at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] 18 January 1923.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Talbott&amp;apos;&amp;apos; recommissioned 1 May 1930, [[Lieutenant]] [[C. H. Cobb]] in command, and immediately began shakedown training in Delaware Bay. For the 10 years that followed, the ship operated along the Atlantic coast and in the [[Caribbean]] engaging in antisubmarine training; fleet operations; and carrying out the many far-ranging duties of the United States fleet. She also helped to train reserves and midshipmen.

With the outbreak of the war in Europe, and America&amp;apos;s initial effort to protect its shipping while remaining neutral, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Talbott&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was assigned patrol duties in the waters off the Atlantic entrance to the [[Panama Canal]]. Following America&amp;apos;s entry into the war with the surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the ship took up convoy escort duties between [[New Orleans]], [[Cuba]], and the Canal, helping to protect the sea lanes and to move the vast amounts of men and materiel needed for victory.

Following an overhaul in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in January 1944, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Talbott&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sailed 13 February with her first transatlantic convoy, and, after her safe return from [[Casablanca]], took up escort duties with convoys from [[Iceland]] southward into the Caribbean. Later in the year, after arrival 15 September, she was converted at New York and reclassified &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AG-81&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 25 September 1944. The ship arrived [[Port Everglades, Florida]], 1 November to act as a target ship for torpedo bombers, continuing this important training service until the war&amp;apos;s end.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Talbott&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was decommissioned at [[Boston]] on 21 May 1946, stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 19 June 1946 and sold for scrap to the Boston Metals Corporation of [[Baltimore]] in [[Maryland]] on 22 December 1946.
