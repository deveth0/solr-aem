&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Estocin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (FFG-15)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ninth ship of the [[Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oliver Hazard Perry&amp;apos;&amp;apos; class]] of guided-missile frigates, was named for Captain [[Michael John Estocin]] (1931–1967). Ordered from [[Bath Iron Works]] on 27 February 1976 as part of the FY76 program, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Estocin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was laid down on 2 April 1979, launched on 3 November 1979, and commissioned on 10 January 1981.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Estocin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (FFG-15) was the first ship of that name in the US Navy.

==TCG &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Göksu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (F 487)==
Decommissioned and stricken on 3 April 2003, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Estocin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was on the same day transferred to [[Turkey]] as that nation&amp;apos;s TCG &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Göksu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (F 497). As of 2012, she is still in active service.
