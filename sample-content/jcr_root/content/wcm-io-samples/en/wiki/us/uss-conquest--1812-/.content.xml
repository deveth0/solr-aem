The first &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Conquest&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[schooner]] in the [[United States Navy]] during the [[War of 1812]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Conquest&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, formerly the merchant ship &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Genesee Packet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was purchased 8 October 1812 at [[Oswego, New York]], for service on [[Lake Ontario]] under Commodore [[Isaac Chauncey]].

Commanded by Lieutenant [[J. D. Elliott]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Conquest&amp;apos;&amp;apos; cruised constantly on Lake Ontario during the [[War of 1812]], taking part in the attacks on [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] on 9 December 1812; York (now [[Toronto]]) on 27 April 1813; and [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]] on 27 May 1813. She joined in the engagements with the British squadron of 7 to 11 August, 11 and 28 September 1813.

She was laid up at [[Sacketts Harbor, New York]], at the end of the war and sold there in May 1815.
