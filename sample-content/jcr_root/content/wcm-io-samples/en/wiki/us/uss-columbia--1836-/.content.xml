The first &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Columbia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the [[United States Navy]] was a three-masted, wooden-hulled sailing [[frigate]] bearing 50 guns of the [[US Navy]].

She was built at [[Washington Navy Yard]]. Her [[keel]] was laid in 1825, but as was typical of much Navy construction during this period, she was not launched until 9 March 1836.

On her first cruise, from May 1838 – June 1840 with Lieutenant [[George A. Magruder]] in command, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Columbia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to become [[flagship]] of [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[George C. Read]] in the [[East India Squadron]]. She returned to the United States by way of [[Cape Horn]], becoming one of the first U.S. naval ships to circumnavigate the globe. She participated in the 1838 [[Second Sumatran Expedition]] in response to a Maylay attack on an American merchant vessel.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Columbia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; served as flagship of the [[Home Squadron]] from January–May 1842; cruised on [[Brazil Squadron]] from July 1842 – February 1844 and in the [[Mediterranean Squadron]] from May–December 1844. She returned to the Brazil Squadron as flagship from November 1845 – October 1847, and was placed [[in ordinary]] at [[Norfolk Navy Yard]] upon her return home. Except for a cruise as flagship of the Home Squadron from January 1853 – March 1855, she remained at Norfolk until the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Columbia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was scuttled and burned by Union forces to avoid her capture by [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] upon the surrender of Norfolk Navy Yard on 21 April 1861. Following the close of the war she was raised and sold at Norfolk on 10 October 1867.
