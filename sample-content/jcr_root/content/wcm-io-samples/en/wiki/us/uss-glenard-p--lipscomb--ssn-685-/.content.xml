&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Glenard P. Lipscomb&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SSN-685)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a unique [[submarine]], was the only ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Glenard P. Lipscomb]] (19 August 1915– 1 February 1970), who served as a Congressman from the [[California&amp;apos;s 24th congressional district|24th District of California]] from 1953 until his death in 1970.

==Design==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Glenard P. Lipscomb&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the Navy&amp;apos;s second submarine design using [[turbo-electric transmission]]. (The first was {{USS|Tullibee|SSN-597}}.) Intended to test the potential advantages of this propulsion system for providing quieter submarine operations, with a [[Tonnage#Weight-based systems|displacement]] of 6,400 [[ton]]s and a length of 365&amp;amp;nbsp;feet, she was heavier and larger than similar vessels with conventional drive trains, which resulted in slower speeds. Those disadvantages, along with reliability issues, led to the decision not to use the design for the follow-on {{sclass|Los Angeles|submarine|0}} submarines. Other than the engine room, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Glenard P. Lipscomb&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was generally similar to the {{sclass|Sturgeon|submarine|0}}, and although serving as a test platform, the &amp;quot;Lipscomb Fish&amp;quot; – her nickname—was a fully combat-capable attack submarine.

==Construction==
Construction of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Glenard P. Lipscomb&amp;apos;&amp;apos; began on 5 June 1971 at the [[Electric Boat Company]] shipyard in [[Groton, Connecticut]]. [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Melvin R. Laird]], a long-time colleague and friend of Glenard Lipscomb, spoke at the keel-laying ceremony and was presented with a model in memory of the event. (Ref Press Release 497-71). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Glenard P. Lipscomb&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 4 August 1973, sponsored by Mrs. Glenard P. Lipscomb, and was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 21 December 1974 with Commander James F. Caldwell in command. Speaking at the commissioning was the Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird.

==Career==
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;History from 1974 to 1990 needed.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Deployed to the North Atlantic in the fall of 1976, followed immediately by a deployment to the Mediterranean Sea in the winter and spring of 1977. Awarded the [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]].

Deployed to the North Atlantic in the winter and spring of 1978. Awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation.

Deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in the winter and spring of 1979.

Awarded the Commander, [[Submarine Development Squadron 12|Submarine Development Squadron Twelve]], [[Battle Effectiveness Award|Battle Efficiency]] [White] &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; and Engineering Excellence [Red] &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; for Fiscal Years 1977, 1978 [Commander Robert B. Wilkinson, Commanding], 1979, and 1980 [Commander Thomas Robertson, Commanding].

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lipscomb&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was decommissioned and struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 11 July 1990 and disposed of by [[Ship-Submarine Recycling Program|submarine recycling]] at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] on 1 December 1997.
