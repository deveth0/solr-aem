The second &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Murray&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DD-97)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Wickes class destroyer|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wickes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] [[destroyer]] in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War I]]. She was named for Commodore [[Alexander Murray (1755-1821)|Alexander Murray]] and Commodore Murray&amp;apos;s grandson, [[Alexander Murray (1816–1884)|Alexander Murray]]{{Which|date=April 2013|reason=Citation needed for either or both.}}.

==History==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Murray&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was laid down 22 December 1917 by [[Fore River Shipbuilding Corporation]], [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], [[Massachusetts]]; launched 8 June 1918; sponsored by Miss [[Alice S. Guthrie]]; and commissioned at [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] 21 August 1918, Lieutenant Commander [[R. G. Walling]] in command.

During her 4 years of operations along the East Coast and in the [[Caribbean]] with the [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Murray&amp;apos;&amp;apos; aided in postwar development of antisubmarine and mine warfare techniques. She was reclassified to a light [[minelayer]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;DM-2&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) 17 July 1920, and received alterations necessary to her new role. She decommissioned at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] 1 July 1922, and lay there in reserve until stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy list]] 7 January 1936. She was sold for scrapping 29 September 1936 to [[Schiavone-Bonomo Corporation]], [[New York, New York|New York City]].
