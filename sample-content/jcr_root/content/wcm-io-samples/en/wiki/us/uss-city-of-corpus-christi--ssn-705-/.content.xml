&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;City Of Corpus Christi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SSN-705)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a [[Los Angeles class submarine|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Los Angeles&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class submarine]], was the second ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], though she is the only one required to bear the &amp;quot;City of&amp;quot; prefix (added to avoid conflicts with the separation of church and state by improperly naming a warship &amp;quot;the body of Christ&amp;quot;, the meaning of the Latin phrase &amp;quot;Corpus Christi&amp;quot;).

The contract to build her was awarded to the [[Electric Boat]] Division of [[General Dynamics]] Corporation in [[Groton, Connecticut]] on 31 October 1973 and her keel was laid down on 4 September 1979.  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 25 April 1981 sponsored by Mrs. [[John Tower]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 8 January 1983 with Commander W.G. &amp;quot;Jerry&amp;quot; Ellis in command.

The ship is currently homeported in Pearl Harbor, HI,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | title = USS CITY OF CORPUS CHRISTI (SSN 705) | url = http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/SSN705.htm | publisher = [[Naval Vessel Register]] | accessdate = 18 October 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; moving there in May 2011 after being previously forward deployed to Apra Harbor, Guam.

The ship&amp;apos;s patch was chosen by the crew based on entries to an art contest sponsored by the Corpus Christi, TX city government.

Current Captain: Commander Christopher Buziak

Ship&amp;apos;s Motto: &amp;quot;For God and Country&amp;quot;
