The second &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Moccasin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SS-5)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a {{sclass|Plunger|submarine}} that was later renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A-4&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

She was laid down under the direction of [[Arthur Leopold Busch]] on 8 November 1900 in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] at the [[Crescent Shipyard]], launched on 20 August 1901, and commissioned on 17 January 1903 at the Holland yard at New Suffolk, N.Y. with [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] Frank L. Pinney in command.

Assigned to duty at the [[Naval Torpedo Station]] at Newport, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Moccasin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; operated locally on principally training and experimental activities until assigned to the [[Reserve Torpedo Flotilla]] at Norfolk on 15 June 1904, in which unit she remained inactive for the next half decade. On 20 July 1909, the submarine torpedo boat was loaded onto the [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] {{USS|Caesar|AC-16|2}}, which sailed soon thereafter for the [[Philippines]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Moccasin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{&amp;apos;}}s sister-ship, {{USS|Adder|SS-3|2}}, was on board as deck cargo as well, lashed to the auxiliary&amp;apos;s forward well deck. Arriving at [[Olongapo]] on 1 October, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Moccasin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was launched on 7 October. Recommissioned on 10 February 1910, she was assigned to the [[First Submarine Division]], [[United States Asiatic Fleet|Asiatic Torpedo Fleet]], based in the [[Manila]] area.

==A new name==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Moccasin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A-4&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on 17 November 1911. During [[World War I]], like her sister-ships, she patrolled the entrance to [[Manila Bay]] and convoyed ships moving out of local waters. Later placed in reserve, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A-4&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was decommissioned at [[Cavite]] on 12 December 1919.
