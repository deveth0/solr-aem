The first &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Henley&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DD-39)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a modified {{sclass|Paulding|destroyer}} in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War I]] and later in the [[United States Coast Guard]], designated as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;CG-12&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. She was named for [[Robert Henley (naval officer)|Robert Henley]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Henley&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was launched on 3 April 1912 by the [[Fore River Shipbuilding Company]], in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]; sponsored by Miss Constance Henley Kane, great-grandniece or Robert Henley; and commissioned at [[Boston, Massachusetts]], on 6 December 1912, with [[Lieutenant Commander#United States|Lieutenant Commander]] [[W. L. Littlefield]] in command.

==Pre-World War I==
After training and shakedown, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Henley&amp;apos;&amp;apos; joined the US [[Atlantic Torpedo Fleet]] at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], for a peacetime career of tactical exercises and training maneuvers along the coast from the [[Caribbean]] to the [[North Atlantic]]. On 22 April 1914, she joined the fleet off [[Tampico, Mexico]], to protect American citizens and property in the face of [[revolution]] in that country. During this period, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Henley&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also saw duty transporting [[refugee]]s and supplies.  With war in Europe that fall, she began [[Neutrality Patrol]] along the coast and checked belligerent vessels in American ports.

==World War I==
When America entered World War I in April 1917, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Henley&amp;apos;&amp;apos; continued patrol along the coast and also escorted fuel ships to the destroyers guarding America&amp;apos;s first troop [[convoy]] on 13 June. For the remainder of the war, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Henley&amp;apos;&amp;apos; performed convoy duty along the coast and carried out [[anti-submarine]] patrol off [[New York harbor]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Henley&amp;apos;&amp;apos; put in at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] on 22 December 1918 and decommissioned there on 12 December 1919.

==Inter-war period==
Transferred to the Coast Guard on 16 May 1924, she served in the [[Rum Patrol]]. She was originally stationed at [[Stapleton, New York]] and then transferred to [[New London, Connecticut]].

She returned to the Navy on 8 May 1931 and was sold for scrap to [[Michael Flynn Inc.]] of [[Brooklyn, New York]] on 22 August 1934.
