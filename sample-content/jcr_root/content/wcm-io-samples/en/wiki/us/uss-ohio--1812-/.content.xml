&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ohio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a merchant [[schooner]] purchased by the Navy in 1812; converted to a warship by [[Henry Eckford (shipbuilder)|Henry Eckford]]; and commissioned prior to 13 June 1813, with [[Sailing Master]] [[Daniel Dobbins]] in command.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ohio&amp;apos;&amp;apos; served on [[Lake Erie]] in the squadron commanded by Captain [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] during the [[War of 1812]]. The squadron&amp;apos;s mission was to wrest control of the lake from the British. With four other purchased ships, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ohio&amp;apos;&amp;apos; lay at Black Rock below the Falls in the [[Niagara River]], prevented by British blockade from entering [[Lake Erie]]. Finally, in a combined operation with the Army, Perry was able to bring the ships out to join the remainder of the squadron in [[Presque Isle Bay]] at [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ohio&amp;apos;&amp;apos; arrived at Erie on 8 July 1813.

After searching for the British, the squadron anchored at Sandusky on 17 August. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ohio&amp;apos;&amp;apos; returned to Erie for provisions and stores for the squadron, rejoining her sister ships on 3 September. The same day she set sail for Erie again, and thus was not with the squadron when it won the memorable victory over the British at Put-in Bay on 10 September. Three days later &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ohio&amp;apos;&amp;apos; reached Put-in Bay with sorely needed fresh vegetables and meat.

As soon as the ice cleared in early 1814, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ohio&amp;apos;&amp;apos; began patrolling between Long Point and Erie to intercept any British movement by water. In May she assisted in fitting out prizes the {{USS|Detroit|1813|2}} and the {{USS|Queen Charlotte|1813|2}} at Put-in Bay, and convoyed them to Erie. On 12 August 1814, she was captured with the {{USS|Somers|1812|2}} by the British within pistol shot of [[Fort Erie]].
