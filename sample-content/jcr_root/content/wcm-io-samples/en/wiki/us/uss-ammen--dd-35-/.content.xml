The first &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ammen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DD-35)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Paulding class destroyer|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Paulding&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] [[destroyer]] in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War I]] and later in the [[United States Coast Guard]], designated as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;CG-8&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. She was named for [[Rear admiral|Rear Admiral]] [[Daniel Ammen]].

==Construction==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ammen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was laid down on 29 March 1910 by the [[New York Shipbuilding Company]], [[Camden, New Jersey]]; launched on 20 September 1910; sponsored by Miss Ethel C. Andrews; and commissioned at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] on 23 May 1911, [[Lieutenant, junior grade]] [[Lloyd W. Townsend]] in command.

==World War I==
Following commissioning, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ammen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was assigned to the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]]. She operated with the [[Torpedo Flotilla]] along the east coast. Upon the outbreak of World War I in Europe in 1914, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ammen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; began [[Neutrality Patrol|neutrality patrols]] and escort duty along the east coast. After the United States entered the conflict in April 1917, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ammen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sailed for the [[Bahamas]] on a reconnaissance mission. When she returned to the United States, the destroyer entered the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] on 6 May to be fitted out for overseas service. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ammen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was assigned to Division 9, [[Destroyer Force]], and sailed on 18 June for [[St. Nazaire]], France.

After the arrival of the convoy at St. Nazaire on 2 July, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ammen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; proceeded to [[Queenstown, Ireland]], and was attached to American naval forces based there. The ship carried out convoy escort duty between [[Ireland]] and [[France]], patrolled off the Irish coast for enemy submarines, and went to the aid of vessels in distress. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ammen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; returned to the United States in January 1919. She made a cruise to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] before going out of commission at Philadelphia on 11 December 1919. The vessel was designated DD-35 on 17 July 1920.

==Inter-war period==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ammen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; remained at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] until 28 April 1924, when she was transferred to the Coast Guard, in whose hands she was redesignated &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;CG-8&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ammen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was one of 20 destroyers that formed the [[Coast Guard Offshore Patrol Force]], established to help suppress [[Rum-running|bootlegging]].

On 22 May 1931, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ammen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was returned to the Navy, but she performed no further active service. Her name was dropped on 1 July 1933, and thereafter she was referred to as DD-35. She was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 5 July 1934 and sold to [[Michael Flynn, Inc.]], [[Brooklyn, New York]].
