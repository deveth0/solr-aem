The third &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chippewa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a {{sclass|Unadilla|gunboat|3}} which saw service with the [[U.S. Navy]] during the [[American Civil War]].

One of the &amp;quot;[[Ninety-day gunboat]]s&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chippewa&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was launched 14 September 1861 by [[Webb and Bell]], New York; outfitted at [[New York Navy Yard]]; and commissioned 13 December 1861, Lieutenant [[Andrew Bryson]] in command.

Sailing from New York 25 December 1861 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chippewa&amp;apos;&amp;apos; took station on the blockade between [[Fort Monroe, Virginia]], and [[Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina]], remaining there until 9 August 1862 except for a brief repair period at [[Baltimore, Maryland]] 8 March–13 March. During this time she exchanged fire with the enemy at [[Fort Macon|Forts Macon]] and [[Fort Caswell|Caswell]] and [[Federal Point Batteries]], and assisted in the capture of a blockade runner, the [[England|English]] [[brig]] [[HMS Napier|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Napier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] 29 July 1862. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chippewa&amp;apos;&amp;apos; arrived at the [[Washington Navy Yard]], 10 August 1862.

Returning to Fort Monroe she departed from there 18 October 1862 on a cruise in search of [[CSS Florida|CSS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Florida&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] which took her to the [[Azores]]; [[Algeciras]] and [[Cadiz]], Spain; [[Gibraltar]]; [[Funchal, Madeira]]; [[Porto Grande]], [[Africa]]; [[Cape Verde Islands]]; and various ports in the [[West Indies]]. Returning to [[Port Royal, South Carolina]], 30 May 1863, she resumed patrols with the [[South Atlantic Blockading Squadron]] off the coast of [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. She participated in the attacks on [[Fort Wagner, South Carolina]], from 13 July to 21 July 1863, and opened fire on enemy pickets up [[Broad River (South Carolina)|Broad River]], on 12 November. After repairs at [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]], she returned to [[North Carolina]] to take part in the bombardments and capture of [[Fort Fisher]] in December 1864 and January 1865 and [[Fort Anderson]], [[Cape Fear River]], North Carolina, in February 1865.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chippewa&amp;apos;&amp;apos; departed [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], 1 March 1865 and steamed up the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] for patrol duty until 15 May, engaging enemy batteries at [[Dutch Gap Canal]] on 1 April and 2 April.

After cruising to [[Havana, Cuba]], between 17 May and 12 June 1865, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chippewa&amp;apos;&amp;apos; arrived at [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] 17 June where she was decommissioned 24 June 1865, taken to New York 29 June and sold there 30 November 1865.
