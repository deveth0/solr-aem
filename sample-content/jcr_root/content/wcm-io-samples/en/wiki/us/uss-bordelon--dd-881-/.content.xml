&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bordelon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DD/DDR-881)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a {{Sclass|Gearing|destroyer}} of the [[United States Navy]], named for [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[Staff Sergeant]] [[William J. Bordelon]] (1920&amp;amp;ndash;1943), who was posthumously awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his heroism in the [[Battle of Tarawa]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bordelon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was laid down by the [[Consolidated Steel Corporation]] at [[Orange, Texas]] on 9 September 1944, [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 3 March 1945 by Mrs. W. J. Bordelon, the mother of Staff Sergeant Bordelon and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 5 June 1945. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bordelon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; operated as a part of the occupation force in [[Japan]] until March 1946 then alternated operations along the east coast and in the [[Caribbean]] with the [[U.S. 2nd Fleet|2nd Fleet]] with deployments to the [[Mediterranean]] with the [[U.S. 6th Fleet|6th Fleet]].

On 14 September 1976, while refueling alongside the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67|6}} (CV-67), the ships came together and collided. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bordelon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/nowiki&amp;gt;s port [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and some of the [[Superstructure (ship)|superstructure]] were damaged and the main [[Mast (ship)|mast]] snapped and fell on the signal shack, injuring some of the handling team.

The [[ammunition ship]] {{USS|Mount Baker|AE-34|6}} (AE-34) was also involved in the rescue of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bordelon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by escorting her to an [[ammunition]] [[Wikt:depot|depot]] where &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mount Baker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/nowiki&amp;gt;s [[explosive ordnance disposal]] team off-loaded her entire [[cargo]] of ammunition while providing [[electricity|electric]] and water services.

Due to the damage to the superstructure and electronics and the age and condition of the hull, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bordelon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was decommissioned and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 1 February 1977, transferred to [[Iran]] in July 1977 and cannibalized for spare parts.
