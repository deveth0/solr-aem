&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stribling&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DD-96)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Wickes class destroyer|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wickes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] [[destroyer]] in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War I]] and the years following. She was the first ship named in honor of [[Cornelius Stribling]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stribling&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was laid down at [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], on 14 December 1917 by the [[Fore River Shipbuilding Company]], launched on 29 May 1918, sponsored by Miss [[Mary Calvert Stribling]], and commissioned at the [[Boston Navy Yard]] on 16 August 1918, [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Thomas E. Van Metre]] in command.

==Service history==
On 31 August, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stribling&amp;apos;&amp;apos; departed [[New York, New York|New York]] to escort a convoy across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. However, machinery trouble forced her back into New York the following day. After almost three weeks in port, she got underway again on 18 September, this time as an escort to a [[Gibraltar]]-bound convoy. She fueled at [[Ponta Delgada]] in the [[Azores]] and made Gibraltar in early October. From there, she sailed with a convoy for [[Marseilles]] on 10 October. For the next month, she made several Gibraltar-to-Marseilles circuits with [[Allies|Allied]] convoys.

After the [[Armistice]], she sailed to [[Venice]], [[Italy]], to investigate post-armistice conditions there and at various other ports on Italy&amp;apos;s [[Adriatic]] coast and in [[Dalmatia]]. At the completion of that duty, she headed back to the [[United States]], arriving home in July 1919. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stribling&amp;apos;&amp;apos; entered the [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]] for overhaul and repairs before being placed in reduced commission at [[Philadelphia]]. There, she was converted to a [[minelayer]] and, on 17 July 1920, she was redesignated &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;DM-1&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In September 1921, she departed Philadelphia and sailed to the west coast and, from there, proceeded on to [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]]. After a series of maneuvers in the islands, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stribling&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was decommissioned on 26 June 1922. On 1 December 1936, her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy list]]. The following month, her hulk was towed to [[San Pedro, California]], where she was sunk as a target.
