The first &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sea Horse&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a one-gun [[schooner]] that the Navy purchased in 1812 for service on [[Lake Borgne]], near [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. She saw action as part of a squadron of [[gunboat]]s, under the command of Lieutenant [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones]], which opposed the British advance on New Orleans in December 1814.

In an [[Action of 13 December 1814 (Louisiana Campaign)|action]] on the night of 13 December 1814, she repelled two attacks by armed British longboats. Her commanding officer, Sailing Master William Johnson, then beached her and burned her to prevent capture.
