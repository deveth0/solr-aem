Cruising the West African coast in 1824–25, the schooner engaged in the suppression of the [[slavery|slave]] trade. Late in 1825 she returned to the United States and, under [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] [[Foxhall A. Parker]], cruised off the Northeast coast.

Newell]] successively. Returning to the West Indies in 1830, she sailed under Lts. [[John Percival]], [[James Armstrong (Commodore)|James Armstrong]], and [[James McIntosh (Navy)|James McIntosh]].
