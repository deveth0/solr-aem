&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Harwood&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DD/DDE-861)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a {{sclass|Gearing|destroyer}} of the [[United States Navy]]. She was named for [[Commander]] [[Bruce L. Harwood]] USN (1910&amp;amp;ndash;1944) who was twice awarded the [[Navy Cross]], and killed in action during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Harwood&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was laid down by the [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]] at [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]] in [[California]] on 29 October 1944, launched on 22 May 1945, by Mrs. Bruce Lawrence Harwood, widow of Commander Harwood and commissioned on 28 September 1945.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Harwood&amp;apos;&amp;apos; alternated operations along the east coast and in the [[Caribbean]] with the [[United States Second Fleet|2nd Fleet]] with deployments to the [[Mediterranean]] with the [[United States Sixth Fleet|6th Fleet]], underwent an extensive [[Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization]] (FRAM) overhaul at the [[New York Naval Shipyard]] between 2 May 1961 and 2 February 1962.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Harwood&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was decommissioned and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 1 February 1971, transferred to the [[Turkish Navy]] on 17 December 1971, and renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;TCG &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kocatepe&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (D 354)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The ship was sunk in error by Turkish aircraft on 22 July 1974, mistaking it for a Greek vessel during Turkish landings on [[Cyprus]] (see also [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] and [[Friendly fire]]).
