&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tom Bowline&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[schooner]] in the [[United States Navy]] during the [[War of 1812]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tom Bowline&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was purchased by the Navy in late 1814 at [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], for use as a [[storeship]], Lieutenant [[B. V. Hoffman]] in command. Subsequently proceeding to [[New York, New York|New York]], she joined {{USS|President|1800|2}}, {{USS|Hornet|1805|2}}, and {{USS|Peacock|1813|2}} in preparations for a raiding foray into the [[East Indies]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;President&amp;apos;s&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sortie on 14 January 1815, however, ended in disaster — grounding and suffering severe damage, the [[frigate]] fell victim and captive to a superior [[United Kingdom|British]] squadron on the following day — 15 January. On the 22nd, a strong northeasterly gale blew up and provided the three other American ships at New York an opportunity to escape the vigilant eyes of the British blockaders. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tom Bowline&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  bent on storm canvas to accompany &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hornet&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peacock&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in their bid for freedom of the open sea.

Unaware of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;President&amp;apos;s&amp;apos;&amp;apos; fate, the three ships made for [[Tristan da Cunha]] for the prearranged rendezvous. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hornet&amp;apos;&amp;apos; became separated en route, leaving her two consorts to press on without her. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tom Bowline&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peacock&amp;apos;&amp;apos; reached the volcanic island on 18 March — only to be driven off by a gale.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hornet&amp;apos;&amp;apos; arrived five days later, but her landfall coincided with the appearance in the area of British brig-sloop {{HMS|Penguin|1813|2}}. The two ships closed for action, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hornet&amp;apos;&amp;apos; damaged &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Penguin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; seriously enough to warrant destruction of the Briton. The sighting of strange sail on the horizon hastened &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hornet&amp;apos;s&amp;apos;&amp;apos; burning of the prize, but apprehension turned to relief as the sails proved to be &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peacock&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tom Bowline&amp;apos;&amp;apos; returning to Tristan da Cunha for the planned rendezvous. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tom Bowline&amp;apos;&amp;apos; embarked the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Penguin&amp;apos;s&amp;apos;&amp;apos; captive crew and took the prisoners to [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]].

Records giving details of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tom Bowline&amp;apos;s&amp;apos;&amp;apos; subsequent service have not been found, but the vessel was apparently sold in 1818.
