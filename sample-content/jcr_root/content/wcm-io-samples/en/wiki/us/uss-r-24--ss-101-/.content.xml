&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;R-24&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SS-101)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[R class submarine|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;R&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] coastal and harbor defense submarine of the [[United States Navy]].  Her keel was laid down on 9 May 1919 by the [[Lake Torpedo Boat]] Company of [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]; the R-boats built by Lake Torpedo Boat (R-21 through R-27) are sometimes considered a separate class from those built by [[Fore River Shipbuilding]] (R-1 through R-14) and [[Union Iron Works]] (R-15 through R-20).  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 21 August 1918 sponsored by Mrs. Edmund R. Norton, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 27 June 1919 with Lieutenant Commander Andrew C. Bennett in command.

==Service history==
After four months of coastal operations off southern [[New England]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;R-24&amp;apos;&amp;apos; got underway for her homeport, [[Coco Solo]], [[Panama Canal Zone]], on 1 November. Based there for her active service she was given [[hull classification symbol]] SS-101 in July 1920 and at the end of 1921 she returned to the [[United States]] for a shipyard overhaul. In the fall of 1922, she resumed operations out of Coco Solo and [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]]. A year later she again sailed to the United States for a shipyard overhaul and at the end of 1924 she returned for inactivation. On 25 January 1925, she arrived at [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and on 11 June she was decommissioned after only five-and-a-half years of service. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;R-24&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was berthed at [[League Island]] for the next five years. On 9 May 1930 she was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] and in July was sold for scrapping.
