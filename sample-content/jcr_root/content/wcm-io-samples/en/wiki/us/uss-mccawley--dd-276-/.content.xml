{{Otherships|USS McCawley}}

The first &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;McCawley&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DD-276)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Clemson class destroyer|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Clemson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] [[destroyer]] in the [[United States Navy]] following [[World War I]]. She was named for Colonel [[Charles McCawley]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;McCawley&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was laid down 5 November 1918 by the [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation]], [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]; launched 14 June 1919; sponsored by Miss Eleanor Laurie McCawley, granddaughter of Colonel McCawley; and commissioned 22 September 1919, Lieutenant (junior grade) H. E. Haynes, in command.

Following an east coast fitting out and shakedown period, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;McCawley&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sailed for [[San Diego, California]] where she joined [[Destroyer Squadron 2]], later DesRon 4, [[U.S. Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]]. She participated in local exercises off the west coast until she decommissioned at San Diego 7 June 1922.

On 27 September 1923, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;McCawley&amp;apos;&amp;apos; recommissioned and was again assigned to the Pacific Fleet. For the next 6 years she operated there, taking part in various fleet problems in addition to local and squadron training exercises. With two exceptions, during 1924 and 1927 when she steamed to the [[Caribbean]] for fleet problems, she spent the entire period in operations along the west coast, from San Diego to [[Puget Sound]], and in [[Hawaii]]an waters.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;McCawley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, designated for deactivation under the terms of the [[London Naval Treaty|London Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armament]], decommissioned at San Diego 1 April 1930. Her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy list]], 13 August 1930, and her hulk was scrapped and sold at auction 2 September 1931.
