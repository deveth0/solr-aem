&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boone&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (FFG-28)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the twentieth ship in the [[United States Navy]]&amp;apos;s [[Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oliver Hazard Perry&amp;apos;&amp;apos; class]] of guided missile [[frigate]]s.

The frigate was named for Vice Admiral [[Joel Thompson Boone]], M.D. (1889&amp;amp;ndash;1974).  FFG-28, the first U.S. ship to bear the admiral&amp;apos;s name, was ordered 23 January 1978, [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] 16 January 1980 by [[Todd Pacific Shipyards]], and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] 15 May 1982. She has since earned numerous awards and commendations.

The rudder fell off Mayport-based frigate USS Boone while on deployment in the western Mediterranean. The mishap forced the ship to send out a call for help to which Canadian destroyer [[HMCS Iroquois (DDG 280)|HMCS Iroquois]] responded, providing divers who inspected the ship&amp;apos;s underside. Within 24 hours, Boone was being towed to [[Naval Station Rota Spain|Rota]] for repairs by the German Navy&amp;apos;s replenishment oiler [[Rhön-class_tanker|Spessart]]. The ship was not adrift or totally dead in the water because its two 350-horsepower auxiliary propulsion units provided a “limited amount of maneuverability.” The lost rudder was replaced Dec. 27 and, after a day of operational testing, Boone got underway again Dec. 28.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.seawaves.com/newsletters/TDIH/november/30nov] {{dead link|date=May 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boone&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was assigned to [[DESRON|Destroyer Squadron 14]] and was the recipient of the 2005 DESRON 14 [[Battle E|Battle &amp;quot;E&amp;quot;]]. On 16 February 2007, she was awarded the 2006 Battle &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; award.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=27895|title=Surface Force Ships, Crews Earn Battle &amp;quot;E&amp;quot;|publisher=U.S. Navy|date=2007-02-19|accessdate=2013-05-28}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boone&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was homeported in [[Naval Station Mayport|Mayport, Florida]], and was a member of the [[United States Navy Reserve|Navy Reserve]].  In March 2010, she was assigned to the [[United States Fifth Fleet]] fighting [[Somali piracy]].

The last Commanding Officer of the USS Boone was LCDR Robert Speight.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.boone.navy.mil/Site%20Pages/CO.aspx &amp;apos;CO Bio]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boone&amp;apos;&amp;apos; decommissioned 23 February 2012.
