The first &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hancock&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[schooner]] under the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. She was named for [[John Hancock]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hancock&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was the former schooner &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Speedwell&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, hired from Mr. Thomas Grant of [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]], in October 1775 as one of a small fleet fitting out to prey upon British supply ships and support General [[George Washington]]&amp;apos;s siege of [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. This fleet, the first under Continental pay and control, came to be called &amp;quot;[[George Washington&amp;apos;s Navy]].&amp;quot;

In October 1775, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hancock&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and {{USS|Franklin|1775|2}} were ordered to intercept two [[brig]]s as they arrived in the [[St. Lawrence River]] from England. But the two schooners instead sought easier quarry off [[Cape Canso]] where five prizes of dubious legality were taken. They also raided [[Charlottetown]] settlement without regard to orders to respect [[Canada|Canadian]] property. The story of their illegal actions reached General Washington who dismissed both ship commanders and returned their prizes to Canadian owners with apologies.

On 1 January 1776, Captain [[John Manley (naval officer)|John Manley]], [[Continental Army]], was appointed [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] of the Fleet and hoisted his flag in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hancock&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. She captured two enemy transports on 25 January 1776, fending off an eight-gun British schooner in a brisk engagement while prize crews took the captured ships into [[Plymouth Harbor]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[#Coggins|Coggins, 2002, p.25]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On 30 January 1776 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hancock&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was intercepted off Plymouth by the 14-gun British Brig &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hope&amp;apos;&amp;apos; who had sailed from Boston for the express purpose of capturing &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hancock&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The American schooner ran ashore and grounded where it became impossible for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hope&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, with her deeper draft, to draw close aboard. The little sloop refloated and captured several more prizes in joint operations with the squadron by April 1776 when Captain [[Samuel Tucker]] took command of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hancock&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He relieved Commodore [[John Manley]] who was taken into the [[Continental Navy]] to command Continental Frigate [[USS Hancock (1776)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hancock&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hancock&amp;apos;&amp;apos; captured two brigs off Boston 7 May 1776. She continued to cruise under Tucker until declared unfit for service late in 1776. She returned to her owner early the following year.
