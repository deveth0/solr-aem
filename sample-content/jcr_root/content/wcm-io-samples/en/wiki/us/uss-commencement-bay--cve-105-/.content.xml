&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Commencement Bay&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (CVE-105)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ex-&amp;apos;&amp;apos;St. Joseph Bay&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was launched 9 May 1944 by [[Todd Pacific Shipyards]], [[Tacoma, Washington]]; sponsored by Mrs. F. Eves; and commissioned 27 November 1944, Captain Roscoe Leroy Bowman in command.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Commencement Bay&amp;apos;&amp;apos; reported at [[Seattle]] 1 February 1945 for duty as a training ship in [[Puget Sound]] until 2 October. During this time she trained 545 officers and 5,053 men of precommissioning crews for sister escort carriers, and qualified 249 pilots of eight air groups in carrier takeoffs and landings. She sailed from [[Bremerton]] 21 October 1945, and arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]] 4 November for training and to conduct carrier qualifications until sailing 27 November for Seattle and Tacoma.

After visits to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]], she returned to Tacoma 28 January, where she was placed out of commission in reserve 30 November 1946. She was re-classified &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;CVHE-105&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 12 June 1955; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AKV-37&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 7 May 1959.
