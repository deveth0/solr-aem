&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Biddle&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DD–151)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Wickes class destroyer|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wickes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; class]] [[destroyer]] in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]], later reclassified &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AG-114&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. She was the second ship named for [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Nicholas Biddle (1750-1778)|Nicholas Biddle]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Biddle&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was launched 3 October 1918 by [[William Cramp and Sons]] Ship and Engine Building Company, [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], sponsored by Miss Elise B. Robinson, a great-great-grandniece of Captain Biddle; and commissioned 22 April 1919, [[Commander]] [[C. T. Blackburn]] in command.

==Service history==
Following her commissioning, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Biddle&amp;apos;&amp;apos; made a cruise to the [[Mediterranean]] and returned to [[New York, New York|New York]] 1 July 1920. After assignment to Division 48, [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]], she cruised along the east coast until decommissioned at [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] 20 June 1922. She remained laid up until recommissioned 16 October 1939. Until November 1940 she served on patrol duty with Destroyer Division 66, [[Atlantic Squadron]], and on training duty with [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]]. She patrolled in the [[Caribbean]] under orders of the Commandant, 15th Naval District (November 1940-May 1941) and then rejoined Destroyer Division 66 patrolling out of [[Key West, Florida]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Biddle&amp;apos;&amp;apos; spent March 1942-February 1945 on convoy duty in the Caribbean except for two short periods. She formed part of anti-submarine TG 2. (18 January 1944 – 27 February 1944) and escorted a convoy to [[North Africa]] (24 March 1944 – 11 May 1944). During the latter mission, 11–12 April, while fighting off an air attack, she had seven men wounded by a strafing attack by a [[Germany|German]] plane. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Biddle&amp;apos;&amp;apos; operated off the east coast, March–July 1945, on training exercises with motor torpedo boats. She was reclassified a miscellaneous auxiliary (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AG-114&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) 30 June 1945, and arrived at [[Boston Navy Yard]] 15 July for conversion. Her conversion was completed just as the war with [[Japan]] ended and she remained at [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] until decommissioned 5 October 1945. She was sold 3 December 1946.

==Awards==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Biddle&amp;apos;&amp;apos; received one [[battle star]] for her service with Convoy UGS-37.
