The second &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Farragut&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DD-300)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Clemson class destroyer|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Clemson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class destroyer]] in the [[United States Navy]]. She was named for Admiral [[David Farragut]].

==History==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Farragut&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was laid down by the [[Union Iron Works]] Plant of the [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation]] in [[San Francisco, California]] on 4 July 1918, launched on 21 November 1918 by Mrs. [[Templin Potts]] and commissioned on 4 June 1920.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Farragut&amp;apos;&amp;apos; arrived at [[San Diego, California]] 3 July 1920, and was at once placed in reserve until 31 March 1922. Then she took up a regular training schedule along the west coast, from the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to [[Oregon]]. On 27 July 1923, at [[Seattle, Washington]], she took part in a review taken by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Warren G. Harding]], on his way home from a visit to Alaska. Returning to San Diego, she, with eight other ships, grounded on a foggy night on Honda Point, 8 September, in the [[Honda Point Disaster]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Farragut&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and one other ship were able to get clear with only minor damage, while the others remained stranded on the rocky shore.

In both 1924 and 1927, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Farragut&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sailed into the [[Caribbean]] for fleet concentrations for maneuvers, in 1927 continuing north to visit New York, [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. Her first visit to the [[Hawaiian Islands]] was in the summer of 1925, during which she acted as station ship during the flight of [[seaplane]]s from the west coast to Hawaii. Again in the spring of 1928 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Farragut&amp;apos;&amp;apos; exercised in the Hawaiians.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS Farragut&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was decommissioned at [[San Diego]] on 1 April 1930, stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 22 July 1930 and sold for scrap, 31 October 1930 in accordance with the [[London Naval Treaty]].
