&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Impetuous&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (PYc-46)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was private [[yacht]] that served as a [[patrol boat]] of the [[United States Navy]] in both World War I and World War II under different names.

==Service history==
===World War I, 1917&amp;amp;ndash;1918===
She was built in 1915 by Robert Jacob Inc., City Island, [[New York City]] as the yacht &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Paragon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  She was then renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sybilla III&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sometime before she was acquired and commissioned into the Navy on 14 May 1917 as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sybilla III&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SP-104)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. She was returned to the owner and struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] (NVR) on 24 December 1918. In the [[interwar period]] she was renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arlis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

===World War II, 1940&amp;amp;ndash;1945===
She was again acquired by the Navy on 12 August 1940, and commissioned on 16 October as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;PC-454&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Assigned to the [[15th Naval District]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;PC-454&amp;apos;&amp;apos; arrived in the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] in mid-November 1940 to patrol the approaches to the [[Panama Canal]]. From November 1940 to August 1944, she performed escort and patrol operations off [[Central America]] while on constant watch for submarines.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;PC-454&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was named and reclassified &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Impetuous&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (PYc-46)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on 15 July 1943. On 31 August 1944, the patrol yacht arrived in [[Philadelphia]] and was decommissioned there on 27 September, struck from the Naval Register on 14 October and sold by the [[War Shipping Administration]] on 14 June 1945.
