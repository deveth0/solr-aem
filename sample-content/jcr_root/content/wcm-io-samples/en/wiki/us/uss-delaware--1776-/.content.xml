The first &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Delaware&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the [[United States Navy]] was a 24-gun [[sailing frigate]] that had a short career in the [[American Revolutionary War]].

The ship was built under the 13 December 1775 order of the [[Continental Congress]] in the yard of [[Warwick Coates]] of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, under the direction of the [[Marine Committee]]. Upon her launching in July 1776, Captain C. Alexander took command.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Delaware&amp;apos;&amp;apos; served in the [[Delaware River]], joining with [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[John Hazelwood]]&amp;apos;s [[Pennsylvania Navy|Pennsylvania state ships]] in operations which delayed the British Fleet in approaching Philadelphia and supplying the British Army. When the British took possession of Philadelphia 26 September 1777, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Delaware&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, now under the command of [[John Barry (naval officer)|John Barry]], in company with several smaller ships advanced upon the enemy fortifications which were being erected, and opened a destructive fire while anchored some 500 yards from shore.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[#Meany|Meany, 1911]] p.22&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
On 27 September she went aground on the [[wikt:Ebb tide|ebb tide]] and came under the concentrated fire of the British artillery. After a brave defense against overwhelming odds, Captain Alexander was compelled to strike his colors. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Delaware&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was taken into the [[Royal Navy]], and sold in March 1783.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[#DANFS|U.S.Navy, DANFS, Ships Histories]], USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Delaware&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
