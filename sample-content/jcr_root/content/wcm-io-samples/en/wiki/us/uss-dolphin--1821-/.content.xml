During this cruise she visited [[Hawaii]] where she assisted men of the American ship &amp;apos;&amp;apos;London&amp;apos;&amp;apos; wrecked there, and helped other American citizens in the islands. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dolphin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; served in the Pacific until 2 December 1835 when she was sold.
