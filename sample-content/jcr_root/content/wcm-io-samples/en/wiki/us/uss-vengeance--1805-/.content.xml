The second &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vengeance&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[brig]] in the [[United States Navy]] during the [[First Barbary War]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vengeance&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was purchased by the [[United States Navy]] at [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], in 1805 for use as a bomb [[ketch]] against the [[Barbary pirates]].

Commanded by Lieutenant [[William Lewis (US Navy)|William Lewis]], she left Boston for the [[Mediterranean]] on 19 June and was with Capt. [[John Rodgers (naval officer, War of 1812)|John Rodgers]]&amp;apos; squadron of 13 warships when it appeared off [[Tunis]] on 1 August. Impressed by the American show of force, the [[Bey of Tunis]] elected to accept American peace terms, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vengeance&amp;apos;&amp;apos; did not see action. Her subsequent movements are unknown, but she was broken up at [[New York, New York|New York City]] in 1818.
