The second &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DD-296)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Clemson class destroyer|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Clemson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] [[destroyer]] in the [[United States Navy]]. She was named for [[Isaac Chauncey]].

==History==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was launched 29 September 1918 by [[Union Iron Works]], [[San Francisco]], [[California]]; sponsored by Miss D. M. Todd; [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] 25 June 1919, Commander W. A. Glassford, Jr., in command ; and reported to the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]].

From the time of her commissioning, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sailed from [[San Diego]] and [[Mare Island]] to [[Hawaii]] and along the Pacific coast taking part in fleet exercises, gunnery practice, and other training activities. From 15 July 1920 to 14 October 1921, she was in ready reserve at San Diego and Mare Island, then returned to active duty as [[flagship]] of Destroyer Division 31.

On the evening of 8 September 1923, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in company with a large group of destroyers was sailing through a heavy fog from San Francisco to San Diego, when a navigational error on board the first ship in her column turned that destroyer and the six that followed toward the rocky California coast rather than on a reach down [[Santa Barbara Channel]]. All seven destroyers, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, went aground on the jagged rocks off [[Point Pedernales]], in what was called the [[Honda Point Disaster]].

[[File:(Point Honda wrecks, vessels 296, 309, and 312.) - NARA - 295531.tif|thumb|left|USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; aground at Honda Point.]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; stranded upright, high on the rocks, near {{USS|Young|DD-312}}, which had capsized. With none of her men lost, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; at once went to the aid of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Young&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, passing a line by which 70 of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Young&amp;apos;s&amp;apos;&amp;apos; crew clambered hand-over-hand to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Swimmers from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; then rigged a network of lifelines to the coastal cliffs, and both her men and Young&amp;apos;s reached safety by this means. The abandoned &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was wrecked by the surf, and was decommissioned 26 October 1923. All the hulks were sold for salvage and removal as of 25 September 1925.
