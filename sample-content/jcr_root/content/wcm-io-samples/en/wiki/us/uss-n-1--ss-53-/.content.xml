&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;N-1&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SS-53)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the lead ship of [[United States N class submarine|her class of coastal defense submarine]] of the [[United States Navy]].  Her keel was laid down on 26 July 1915 by [[Seattle Construction and Drydock]] Company in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 30 December 1916 sponsored by Mrs. Guy E. Davis, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 26 September 1917 with Lieutenant [[George Trever|George A. Trever]] in command.

==Service history==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;N-1&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was fitted out at [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] and then departed on 21 November 1917 for [[San Francisco, California]], in company with her sisters {{USS|N-2|SS-54|3}} and {{USS|N-3|SS-55|3}}.
Reassigned to the East Coast, she departed San Francisco on 13 December for [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]], [[Panama Canal Zone]], and thence proceeded via [[Cristóbal, Panama|Cristobal]], [[Jamaica]], [[Key West, Florida]], and [[Norfolk, Virginia]], to [[New London, Connecticut]], arriving on 7 February 1918.

Reporting for duty to Commander, First Naval District, the submarine began her first patrol on 23 June by hunting for a [[U-boat]] reported in the vicinity of [[Cape Cod]]. After an intensive but fruitless search, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;N-1&amp;apos;&amp;apos; continued her patrol off the [[New England]] coast. For the remainder of the war and until early 1922, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;N-1&amp;apos;&amp;apos; continued her operations in the area from New London to [[Bar Harbor]].

Placed in reduced commission on 1 May 1922, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;N-1&amp;apos;&amp;apos; became a training submarine for the Submarine School, New London.  She continued this duty until ordered to [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] on 9 December 1925. Arriving at [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], on 18 December, she was decommissioned on 30 April 1926. Struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 18 December 1930, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;N-1&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was scrapped in early 1931.
