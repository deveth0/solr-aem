&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Absaroka&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[steamboat|steamer]] in the service of the [[United States Navy]], named after the [[Absaroka Range]] of mountains in [[Montana]] and [[Wyoming]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Absaroka&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was built in 1917 for the [[United States Shipping Board]] by [[Skinner &amp;amp; Eddy]] Company, [[Seattle, Washington]], taken over by the Navy on a [[Bareboat charter|bare boat]] basis on 17 September 1918, and commissioned that same day, [[Lieutenant commander|Lt. Comdr.]] [[O. W. Hughes]] in command.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Absaroka&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was assigned to the [[Naval Overseas Transportation Service]] following her commissioning. Between October 1918 and February 1919, the ship made two transatlantic voyages carrying Army cargo to ports in [[France]], [[England]], and the [[Netherlands]]. During her second trip, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Absaroka&amp;apos;&amp;apos; rescued the captain and crew of the disabled [[United Kingdom|British]] steamer &amp;apos;&amp;apos;War Marvel&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and landed them safely at [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth, England]].

The ship arrived in [[City of New York|New York City]] on 12 February 1919 and was immediately drydocked for overhaul. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Absaroka&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was decommissioned on 4 March 1919 and returned to the United States Shipping Board.
