The first &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Accomac&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (YT-18/YTL-18)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a small [[tugboat|harbor tug]] in the service of the [[United States Navy]], named after [[Accomac, Virginia]].

She was built as the Steam Tug &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;El Toro&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; at [[Newport News, Virginia]] by [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding]], and purchased by the Navy on 26 March 1898 because of the impending [[Spanish–American War|war with Spain]]. She was renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Algonquin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 2 April 1898 with [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] [[W. S. Crowley]] in command.

After being outfitted at the [[New York Navy Yard]], the tug reported for duty with the [[North Atlantic Squadron]] at its base at [[Key West, Florida]] on 13 April. On 15 June 1898, she was renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Accomac&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The vessel served at Key West through end of the year. In January 1899, she was reassigned to the [[Cuba]]n occupation forces and was based at [[Havana, Cuba]].

Between late 1900 and December 1911, the small ship successively served as a yard tug at [[Port Royal, South Carolina]], Key West, and [[Pensacola, Florida]]. On 4 December 1911, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Accomac&amp;apos;&amp;apos; arrived at the [[Boston Navy Yard]] where she spent the remainder of her active career. In 1918 she was renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nottoway&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and in July 1920, when the Navy adopted the alphanumeric system of [[hull classification symbol|hull designations]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nottoway&amp;apos;&amp;apos; received the hull number &amp;quot;YT-18&amp;quot;.  On 5 October 1942, her name was cancelled, and she became simply &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;YT-18&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. On 15 May 1944, the tug was redesignated a small harbor tug, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;YTL-18&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. She served at Boston as a yard tug through the end of [[World War II]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;YTL-18&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was placed out of service at Boston on 3 April 1946, and her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy List]] on 17 April 1946. On 15 October 1946, she was sold to Mr. Arthur M. Hall, of Boston, Massachusetts, presumably for scrapping.
