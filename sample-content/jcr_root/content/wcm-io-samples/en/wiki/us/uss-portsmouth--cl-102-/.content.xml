&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Portsmouth&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (CL–102)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Cleveland class cruiser|Cleveland class]] [[light cruiser]] of the [[United States Navy]], the third ship to carry the name.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Portsmouth&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was laid down by the [[Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]] of [[Newport News, Virginia]] on 28 June 1943; launched on 20 September 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Marian M. Dale and Mrs. Sarah B. Leigh, and commissioned 25 June 1945, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Heber B. Brumbaugh in command.

==Service history==
Following shakedown off [[Cuba]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Portsmouth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, based at Norfolk, was employed with the Operational Development Force until the spring of 1946. In May she departed on a goodwill cruise to Africa and after visiting [[Cape Town]], [[Lagos]], [[Freetown]], [[Monrovia]], [[Dakar]], and [[Casablanca]], steamed into the [[Mediterranean]] for calls at [[Naples]], and [[Palermo]] before heading home.

On 25 November, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Portsmouth&amp;apos;&amp;apos; got underway to return to the Mediterranean. Arriving at Naples on 7 December, she shifted around the peninsula to [[Trieste]] at the end of the month, and until February 1947 cruised in the politically turbulent [[Adriatic]]. The following month, she returned for another two weeks at Trieste and in April she sailed for the [[United States]]. The following November, she again steamed east to the Mediterranean, returning to the east coast for overhaul at [[Boston]] on 11 March 1948. On completion of overhaul, she resumed type exercises off the eastern seaboard and conducted Naval Reserve training cruises to the Caribbean. On 9 March 1949, she entered the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]] for inactivation overhaul.

Decommissioned on 15 June 1949, she joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Two of her main engines remain in service today as part of the MARF facility for the [[S7G]] nuclear reactor prototype in [[Ballston Spa]], [[NY]].
