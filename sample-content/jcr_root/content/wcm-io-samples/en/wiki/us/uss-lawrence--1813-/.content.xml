&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lawrence&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was one of two 493-ton &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Niagara&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class [[brig]]s (more correctly: [[Snow (ship)|snows]]) built at [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], by [[Adam Brown (shipwright)|Adam]] and [[Noah Brown]] under the supervision of [[Sailing Master]] [[Daniel Dobbins]] and [[Master Commandant]] [[Oliver Hazard Perry]], for [[United States Navy]] service on the [[Great Lakes]] during the [[War of 1812]].

She was commissioned in early August 1813 and quickly began operations with a voyage to [[Detroit, Michigan]] in search of the opposing British squadron. During the 10 September 1813 [[Battle of Lake Erie]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lawrence&amp;apos;&amp;apos; served as [[flagship]] for Perry until she was disabled by enemy fire. Perry then transferred to her sister-ship, the [[USS Niagara (1813)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Niagara&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], from which he fought the battle to a successful conclusion.

In mid-1815, following the end of hostilities, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lawrence&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was sunk in Misery Bay on [[Presque Isle State Park|Presque Isle, PA]] in order to preserve her hull. Her submerged hulk was sold in 1825 and, except for a brief examination in 1836, remained underwater for five more decades.

In September 1875, her remains were raised, cut into sections and transported by rail to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] where she was exhibited during [[Centennial Exposition|The U.S. Centennial International Exhibition of 1876]]. Her remains were destroyed by a fire during that exhibition.
