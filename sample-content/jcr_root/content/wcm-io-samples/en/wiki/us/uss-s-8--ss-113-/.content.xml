&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-8&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SS-113)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a second-group ({{USS|S-3|SS-107|2}} or &amp;quot;Government&amp;quot;) [[United States S class submarine|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;S&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] [[submarine]] of the [[United States Navy]]. Her keel was laid down on 9 November 1918 by the [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 21 April 1920 sponsored by Mrs. Roy W. Ryden, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 1 October 1920 with [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Eric F. Zemke in command.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-8&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sailed from [[Newport, Rhode Island]] on 7 December 1920 and was attached to Submarine Division 12 (SubDiv 12). After her division had rendezvoused with SubDiv 18 off [[New Hampshire]], they proceeded via the [[Panama Canal]] and [[California]] to [[Hawaii]], arriving at [[Pearl Harbor]] on 15 April 1921. Departing Pearl Harbor on 3 November, they arrived at [[Cavite]], [[Luzon]], in the [[Philippines]] on 1 December. This voyage set a record for American submarines, at that time, as the longest cruise ever undertaken. Other submarines — which had operated on the Asiatic station prior to this — were transported overseas on the decks of [[Collier (ship type)|collier]]s.

The two divisions — which comprised Submarine Flotilla 3 (SubFlot 3) — operated out of Cavite for the next three years, with annual visits to ports in [[China]]. They finally departed Cavite on 29 October 1924, and arrived at [[Mare Island, California]] on 30 December.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-8&amp;apos;&amp;apos; remained at Mare Island through 1925, operated along the West Coast during 1926, and sailed on 10 February 1927 for the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. She operated at [[Coco Solo]] from March into April, and then sailed for [[New London, Connecticut]], arriving on 3 May.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-8&amp;apos;&amp;apos; spent the next three years operating along the [[New England]] coast, out of New London, with the exception of training cruises to the [[Panama Canal]] area from February-April 1928, January-April 1929, and January-March 1930.

Departing New London on 22 October, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-8&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sailed to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], where she was decommissioned on 11 April 1931. She was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 25 January 1937.
