The first &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DD-3)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (originally &amp;quot;Destroyer No. 3&amp;quot;) was a [[Bainbridge class destroyer|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bainbridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] [[destroyer]] in the [[United States Navy]] named for [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Isaac Chauncey]].

==Construction==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was launched on 26 October 1901 by [[Neafie and Levy Ship and Engine Building Company]] of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. She was sponsored by Mrs. M. C. S. Todd and placed in reduced commission on 20 November 1902. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; placed in reserve on 2 December 1902 and received full [[ship commissioning|commission]] on 21 February 1903. [[Lieutenant]] Stanford Elwood Moses was placed in command and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; reported to the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]].

==Pre-World War I==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; served with the Coast Squadron until 20 September 1903, when she was transferred to the [[United States Asiatic Fleet|Asiatic Fleet]] and left [[Key West]] for the Orient on 18 December. After sailing by way of the [[Suez Canal]], she arrived at [[Cavite]] to join the force representing US interest in the Far East as it cruised in the [[Philippines]] during winters and off [[China]] during summers. Aside from the period of 3 December 1905-12 January 1907, when she was in reserve at Cavite, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; continued this service until the entrance of America into [[World War I]].

===Sinking===
The destroyer sailed from Cavite on 1 August 1917 for [[convoy]] escort duty in the eastern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], based at [[St. Nazaire]], France. On 19 November, while about {{convert|110|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Gibraltar]] on escort duty, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was rammed by the [[United Kingdom|British]] merchantman SS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rose&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as both ships steamed in war-imposed darkness. At 03:17, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sank in {{convert|9000|ft|m|abbr=on}} of water, taking to their death 21 men including her [[Captain (naval)|captain]], [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] [[Walter E. Reno]]. 70 survivors were picked up by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rose&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and carried to port.

==USS Chauncey in literature==
The novel [[Delilah (novel)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Delilah&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] was written by a survivor of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Marcus Goodrich, and is a fictional account based on his experience serving aboard &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as an enlisted man.
