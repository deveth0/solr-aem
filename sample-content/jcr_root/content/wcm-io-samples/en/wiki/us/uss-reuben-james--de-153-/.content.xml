&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reuben James&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DE-153)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Buckley class destroyer escort|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Buckley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] [[destroyer escort]] in the [[United States Navy]].  She was the second ship named for [[Reuben James]], a Boatswain&amp;apos;s Mate who distinguished himself fighting the [[Barbary pirates]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reuben James&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was laid down on 7 September 1942 at the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]], [[Portsmouth, Virginia]], launched on 6 February 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Oliver Hiram Ward, and commissioned on 1 April 1943, with [[Lieutenant Commander]] Frank D. Giambattista in command.

==Service history==
First based in [[Miami, Florida]], she conducted [[anti-submarine]] patrols and provided training in [[convoy]] escort and [[anti-submarine warfare]]. In March 1944, she shifted homeport from Miami to [[Norfolk, Virginia]].  In June 1944, she escorted a convoy from [[New York]] to Norfolk.  Between 13 July and 7 November 1944, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reuben James&amp;apos;&amp;apos; successfully escorted two convoys to the [[Mediterranean]], returning with westbound convoys.  During the ship&amp;apos;s first eastbound voyage, nine [[Germany|German]] bombers attacked its convoy off [[Algeria]] on 1 August 1944.  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reuben James&amp;apos;&amp;apos; shot down one enemy bomber.  Returning to Boston on 7 November 1944, she joined an anti-submarine group operation in the [[North Atlantic]].  Operating south of [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reuben James&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was present when {{USS|Buckley|DE-51|3}} sank {{ship|German submarine|U-879||2|up=yes}} on 19 April 1945.

Arriving at [[Houston, Texas]], on 4 July 1945, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reuben James&amp;apos;&amp;apos; completed conversion to a [[radar picket ship]] on 25 November 1945, and was subsequently employed in the [[Atlantic]] and the [[Caribbean]] while being stationed in Norfolk, Virginia.  She was decommissioned on 11 October 1947.

In 1949, she was designated [[radar picket|DER]], but was reclassified [[Destroyer Escort|DE]] in 1954. She remained in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy List]] on 30 June 1968. Her hulk was sunk as a target on 1 March 1971.
