The first &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Montezuma&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[ship]] in the [[United States Navy]] during the [[Quasi-War]] with [[France]]. Her merchant name was retained.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Montezuma&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was built in [[Virginia]] in 1795 for transatlantic voyages; acquired by the Navy 26 June 1798 from [[William Taylor]]{{dn|date=October 2012}} at [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], for service against [[France|French]] naval vessels and privateers attacking American merchantmen during the [[Quasi-War]]; and placed in service by the end of August 1798, Capt. [[Alexander Murray (1755–1821)|Alexander Murray]] in command.

Departing Baltimore on 3 November, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Montezuma&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sailed as [[flagship]] of a squadron consisting of [[brig]] {{USS|Norfolk|1798|2}}, [[Cutter (ship)|cutter]] {{USS|Eagle|1798|2}}, and [[schooner]] {{USS|Retaliation|1798|2}} for the [[West Indies]] to cruise off [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]], to protect American merchantmen and search for French [[Man-of-war|men-of-war]]. The ships encountered two enemy vessels on 20 November and gave chase, capturing without a fight the brig &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fair American&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, an American vessel taken by French [[privateer]]s only five days previously, but losing &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Retaliation&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to two French [[frigate]]s that appeared on the horizon. After a long chase the squadron was able to evade the French warships and then put into [[Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Montezuma&amp;apos;&amp;apos; continued on her duty in the West Indies, convoying merchant ships to various [[Caribbean]] ports into 1799 and then on 7 March fell in with and captured French brig &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Les Amis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 16 guns, off [[Curaçao]]. She was ordered home in mid-March and arrived [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] after convoying 57 merchant ships to various ports on the eastern seaboard 12 May 1799.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Montezuma&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sailed on her second voyage to the West Indies, 28 May, Lt. [[John Mullowny]] in command, this time bound for [[Saint Kitts|St. Kitts]] in the [[Leeward Islands]], escorting U.S. shipping and then sailing to [[Jamaica]] to take on prize money, carrying it to Philadelphia, arriving [[Fort Mifflin]] on 31 July. The warship departed Fort Mifflin on 4 August on her last voyage in the Navy, dispatched to St. Kitts to pick up French prisoners for immediate return to Baltimore. Arriving on 28 August, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Montezuma&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, because of cramped, unfavorable conditions, loaded only 50 prisoners and departed on 30 August to return to Baltimore, arriving on 14 September.

There the ship remained while all her armament and stores were removed, preparatory to being sold, because of her poor seakeeping ability as a warship. Following much deliberation, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Montezuma&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was finally sold to her original owner, William Taylor of Baltimore on 30 December 1799. Re-equipped for merchant service she sailed the Atlantic on a Baltimore-[[Liverpool]] run until disposed of some years before the beginning of the [[War of 1812]].
