==Service history==

===US Navy, 1941&amp;amp;ndash;1946===
Assigned to the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory|Naval Research Laboratory]], Bellevue, D.C., &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aquamarine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; assisted in experimental work, chiefly underwater sound. Although most of her experiments were conducted on the [[Potomac River]] and [[Chesapeake Bay]], she also operated off [[New London, Connecticut]], from 16 October to 4 November 1943, and off the [[Florida]] coast and in the Bahamas from 24 January 1944 to 18 April 1945. During 1945 and 1946 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aquamarine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; had additional duty as special tender to the presidential yachts {{USS|Potomac|AG-25|2}} and {{USS|Williamsburg|AGC-369|2}}.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aquamarine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was decommissioned on 21 June 1946 and transferred to the [[Maritime Commission]] on 31 January 1947 for disposal.

===Private ownership, 1947&amp;amp;ndash;2008===
She was sold to Colonel E. M. Grimm of Columbus, Ohio, in 1947, and her name changed back to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Seawolf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. She was sold in 1954 to Ennolls A. Stephens of [[Irvington, Virginia]], owner of [[The Tides Inn]], Irvington, and renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Miss Ann&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 2008, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Miss Ann&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was sold to private interests who placed her in Charter Service on the Potomac River.  She is currently located at the Colonial Beach Yacht Club in Colonial Beach, Virginia.
