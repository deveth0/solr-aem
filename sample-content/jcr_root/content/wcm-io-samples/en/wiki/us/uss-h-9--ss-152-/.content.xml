&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;H-9&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SS-152)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[United States H class submarine|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;H&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] [[submarine]] that was on active duty with the [[United States Navy]] from 1918-1922.

The [[Imperial Russian Navy]] ordered 18 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;H&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class submarines from the [[Electric Boat]] Company in 1915. Eleven were delivered, and served as the [[American Holland class submarines]], but shipment of the final six was held up pending the outcome of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]], and the boats were stored in knockdown condition at [[Vancouver, British Columbia]]. All six were purchased by the [[United States Navy]] on 20 May 1918 and assembled at [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;H-9&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 23 November 1918 and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 25 November with [[Lieutenant]] Clarke Withers in command.

Joining Submarine Division 6 (SubDiv 6) at [[San Pedro, California]], and later being transferred to SubDiv 7 there, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;H-9&amp;apos;&amp;apos; participated in a variety of battle and training exercises along the West Coast. She also patrolled off [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina Island]], and put in at [[Mare Island]] for periodic overhauls.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;H-9&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sailed from San Pedro on 25 July 1922 and arrived in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] on 14 September, with SubDivs 6 and 7. The submarine decommissioned at Norfolk on 3 November. Her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 26 February 1931. She was sold for scrapping on 28 November 1933.
