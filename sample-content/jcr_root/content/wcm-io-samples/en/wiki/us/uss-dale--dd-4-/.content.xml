The second &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dale&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DD-4)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Bainbridge class destroyer|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bainbridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos; class]] [[destroyer]] in the [[United States Navy]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dale&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was launched on 24 July 1900 by [[William R. Trigg Company]], [[Richmond, Virginia]]; sponsored by Miss M. H.

==Pre-World War I==
Assigned to the [[North Atlantic Squadron|North Atlantic Fleet]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dale&amp;apos;&amp;apos; cruised with the [[First Torpedo Flotilla]] on the [[Atlantic]] coast, taking part in a fleet search problem conducted off [[Maine]], and passing before [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Theodore Roosevelt]] in review off [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay, New York]], on 17 August 1903.

The First Torpedo Flotilla - convoyed by {{USS|Buffalo|1892|2}} - cleared Norfolk on 12 December 1903 and sailed to the [[Asiatic Station]] by way of the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Suez Canal]]. Arriving at [[Cavite]], [[Philippine Islands]], on 14 April 1904, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dale&amp;apos;&amp;apos; cruised in the islands and on the coast of [[China]] until placed out of commission in reserve at Cavite on 5 December 1905. Recommissioned on 10 July 1907, she remained on duty with the [[Asiatic Fleet]], cruising to [[Japan]] and China, engaging in [[torpedo]] and battle practice and maneuvers with the flotilla, guarding and inspecting the target range at Cavite, and transporting mail and passengers.

==World War I==
After the [[United States]] entered [[World War I]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dale&amp;apos;&amp;apos; patrolled the entrance to [[Manila Bay]] from 30 June-1 August 1917, then sailed to join US Patrol Squadrons based on [[Gibraltar]], arriving there on 20 October. She patrolled and escorted [[convoy]]s in the eastern [[Mediterranean]] until the end of the war.
