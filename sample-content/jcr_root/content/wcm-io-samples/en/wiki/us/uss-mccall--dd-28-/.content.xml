&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;McCall&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DD-28)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a {{Sclass|Paulding|destroyer}} in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War I]] and later in the [[United States Coast Guard]], designated &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;CG-14&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. She was the first ship named for [[Edward McCall]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;McCall&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was laid down on 8 June 1909 by the [[New York Shipbuilding Company]], [[Camden, New Jersey]], launched on 4 June 1910, sponsored by Miss Jessie Willits, and commissioned on 23 January 1911, [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[J. T. Tomkins]] in command.

==United States Navy==
Attached to the [[Torpedo Flotilla]], [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;McCall&amp;apos;&amp;apos; operated along the Atlantic coast, primarily out of [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and the [[Chesapeake Bay]] area. Each winter found her with the fleet in [[Cuba]]n waters for maneuvers.

In 1916, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;McCall&amp;apos;&amp;apos; made [[Neutrality Patrol]]s off [[New York]] and along the [[New England]] coast. On 14 June 1917, following overhaul at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], she steamed to New York to escort a troop convoy to [[Europe]]. The destroyer continued escort duties in the western Atlantic until January 1918, when she sailed for [[Queenstown, Ireland]]. Arriving there on 22 February, she provided escort and rescue services until 16 December.

Upon return to the United States in January 1919, she resumed east coast operations until decommissioning at Philadelphia on 12 December 1919.

==United States Coast Guard==
In reserve for the next 4½ years, she was transferred to the [[United States Coast Guard]] on 7 June 1924. Stationed at [[New London, Connecticut]], she was part of the [[Rum Patrol]].

She was returned to the Navy on 18 October 1930, and was scrapped and sold on 2 May 1934, in accordance with the [[London Naval Treaty]].
