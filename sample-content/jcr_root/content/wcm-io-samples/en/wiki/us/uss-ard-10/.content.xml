&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ARD-10&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[auxiliary repair dock]] in the service of the [[United States Navy]] in [[World War II]]. As was common with other auxiliary repair docks, it was only known by its designation and was not otherwise named.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ARD-10&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was commissioned in [[Alameda, California]] in October 1943 under command of Lieutenant Commander H. P. MacAuliff. She was towed by [[USS Yuma (ATF-94)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yuma&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ATF-94)]] from [[San Francisco, California]] on 12 December 1943 first to [[Sydney]] [[Australia]] and then on to [[Melbourne]] 1 February 1944. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yuma&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ARD-10&amp;apos;&amp;apos; finally arrived at [[Fremantle, Western Australia]], on 6 March 1944. There &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ARD-10&amp;apos;&amp;apos; served the submarine base located there until end of the war.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ARD-10&amp;apos;&amp;apos; returned to the United States after the end of World War II in 1946 and was stricken from US Navy service in July, 1972 and subsequently Sold to Bendershipbuilding Repair Co. In Mexico and today February 06th 2013 Still Operational


&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ARD 10&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a member of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ARD 2&amp;apos;&amp;apos; class of Auxiliary Repair Drydocks (ARD).  The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ARD 2&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Class of drydocks dates to early World War II and were towed to where they were needed most, generally forward area anchorages. Five of the 7 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ARD 2&amp;apos;&amp;apos; class drydocks built are still in existence in foreign navies. The {{convert|486|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ARD&amp;apos;&amp;apos; could handle World War II era ships up to destroyer size.
