&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-11&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SS-116)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a second-group (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-3&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;quot;Government&amp;quot;) [[United States S class submarine|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;S&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class submarine]] of the [[United States Navy]].  Her keel was laid down on 2 December 1919 by the [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 7 February 1921 sponsored by Miss [[Anna E. Roosevelt]] and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 11 January 1923 with Lieutenant Wilder D. Baker in command.

Supplementing duties along the northeast coast, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-11&amp;apos;&amp;apos; visited [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo]], [[Cuba]], in 1923, and [[Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands]], [[Trinidad]], and [[Coco Solo]] in 1924. Sailing from [[New London, Connecticut]], on 29 September, via the [[Panama Canal]] and [[California]], she visited [[Hawaii]] from 27 April to 25 May 1925, before returning to New London on 12 July. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-11&amp;apos;&amp;apos; operated in the [[Panama Canal]] area from January through April 1926, visited [[Kingston, Jamaica]], from 20 March to 28 March 1927, and served again in the [[Panama Canal]] area from February into April 1928. From 1929 into 1936, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-11&amp;apos;&amp;apos; operated almost exclusively in the [[Panama Canal]] area, but was in Miami Florida, on 31 March 1930 and visited [[Washington, DC]], from 15 May to 5 June 1933. From at least 30 June 1929 until at least 7 August 1931, Commanding officer was V.R. Murphy. Departing Coco Solo on 13 June 1936, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-11&amp;apos;&amp;apos; arrived at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], on 22 June, and was decommissioned there on 30 September.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-11&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was recommissioned on 6 September 1940 at Philadelphia. After voyages from New London to Philadelphia, [[Bermuda]], and St. Thomas in 1941, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-11&amp;apos;&amp;apos; arrived at the [[Coco Solo]] submarine base in the [[Panama Canal Zone]], on 5 October that year. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-11&amp;apos;&amp;apos; served in the [[Panama Canal]] area from then into June 1943, and next at Trinidad into February 1944. Following overhaul in the [[Panama Canal]] area, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-11&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sailed in July via [[Aruba]] to [[Trinidad]], where she operated into October. Arriving at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]] on 26 October, she served there into January 1945. After a voyage to the [[Panama Canal]] area, she sailed from there on 8 February, arrived at New London on 24 February, and at Philadelphia on 28 March. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-11&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was decommissioned on 2 May of that year at Philadelphia and was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]]. She was sold on 28 October 1945 to [[Rosoff Brothers]] of [[New York City]]. Resold to [[Northern Metals]] Company of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], on an unspecified date, she was scrapped.
