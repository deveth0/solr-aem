&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Virginia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SP-274)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[yacht]] in the [[United States Navy]].

She was constructed in 1910 by [[Electric Launch Company|Elco]] at [[Bayonne, New Jersey]].  The ship was purchased by the Navy on 5 May 1917 from Mr. Daniel W. Smith of [[New York City]] and delivered to the Government on 2 July.

To avoid the confusion of having several ships of the same name, the Navy discarded her name and referred to her simply as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;SP-274&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, though references to her as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Virginia (SP-274)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy Register]] for 1918 indicate that she probably retained her name informally. Commissioned on 10 August 1917, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;SP-274&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was assigned to the [[9th Naval District]] section patrol; and, although the records are unclear, she probably operated out of [[Detroit]], conducting patrols on [[Lake Michigan]].

She served until 12 August 1919, at which time her name was struck from the Navy Register; and, by 18 March 1920, she had sunk at the Detroit Dock. Here again, the records are unclear with regard to whether she sank before or after being struck. In any event, her sunken hulk was sold to J. A. Nicholson of [[Morris Heights, New Jersey]], on 1 April 1920.
