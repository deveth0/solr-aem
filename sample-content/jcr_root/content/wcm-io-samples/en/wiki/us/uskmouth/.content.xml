        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Uskmouth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-cy|Aberwysg}}) is an area to the south of the city of [[Newport]], [[South Wales]].

== Location ==
Uskmouth is effectively in the west of the village of [[Nash, Newport|Nash]]. It is at Uskmouth that the [[River Usk]] meets the [[Severn estuary]].

== Amenities ==
It includes part of the [[Newport Wetlands Reserve]] [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/496401], a notable [[wildlife reserve]] [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/527460], with reed beds and [[grassland]]s that attract breeding [[bird]]s such as [[Northern lapwing|lapwing]]s, [[Common Redshank|redshank]]s, [[Eurasian Oystercatcher|oystercatcher]]s, [[Little Ringed Plover|little ringed plover]]s and [[ringed plover]]s, as well as visitors such as [[wigeon]]s, [[shoveler]]s, [[Common Teal|teal]]s, [[Common Shelduck|shelduck]]s and [[Northern Pintail|pintail]]s, [[Great Bittern|bittern]]s, [[hen harrier]]s and [[short-eared owl]]s.  It is part of the [[Caldicot and Wentloog Levels|Caldicot Levels]].

Following storms in the autumn of 1986, a track of human footprints was discovered eroding out of the [[clay]]s in the intertidal zone in front of [[Uskmouth Power Station]]. The footprints were found to contain [[peat]] deposits, allowing them to be [[carbon dating|carbon dated]] to 4200BC. This made them the oldest known human footprints in [[UK|Britain]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.gtj.org.uk/index.php?id=4882&amp;amp;L=0 Gathering the Jewels - Uskmouth Footprints]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
