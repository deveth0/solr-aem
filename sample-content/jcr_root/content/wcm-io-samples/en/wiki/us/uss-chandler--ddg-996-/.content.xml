&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chandler&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DDG-996)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the final ship in the [[Kidd class destroyer|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kidd&amp;apos;&amp;apos; class]] of [[guided-missile destroyer]]s operated by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]].  Derived from the [[Spruance class destroyer|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Spruance class&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], these vessels were designed for [[air defense]] in hot weather. She was named after [[Rear Admiral]] [[Theodore E. Chandler]].

Originally named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Andushirvan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the ship was originally ordered by the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Shah of Iran]], but was undelivered when the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] occurred. Subsequent to this, the U.S. Navy elected to commission her for service in the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]], as she was equipped with heavy-duty [[air conditioning]] and was also well suited to filtering sand and the results from [[NBC weapon|NBC warfare]]. She was commissioned in 1982.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chandler&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was decommissioned in 1999. She was transferred to the [[Republic of China]], renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wu&amp;amp;nbsp;Teh&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DDG-1805) in 2004, and finally recommissioned as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[ROCS Ma Kong (DDG-1805)|ROCS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ma&amp;amp;nbsp;Kong&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] (DDG-1805)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 2006.

== Accident ==
In June 1985, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chandler&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was involved in an accident on the [[Columbia River]]. The ship itself was sued under [[Admiralty law]] in the United States by a barge owner who claimed that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chandler&amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{&amp;apos;}}s negligent action on the Columbia River caused a dangerous swell called a [[soliton]].

The District Court of Oregon heard the case and held that the officers on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chandler&amp;apos;&amp;apos; breached their duty to exercise reasonable care in avoiding creation of the dangerous swell and the plaintiff was able to recover for the damages.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bernert_v_chandler&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Bernert Towboat Co. v.
