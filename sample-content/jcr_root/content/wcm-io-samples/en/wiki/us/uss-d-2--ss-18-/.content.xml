&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;D-2&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SS-18)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[United States D class submarine|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;D&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] [[submarine]] of the [[United States Navy]]. Her keel was laid down by [[Fore River Shipbuilding]] Company in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], under a subcontract from [[Electric Boat]] Company of [[Groton, Connecticut]], as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grayling&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, making her the first ship of the U.S. Navy to be named for the [[Arctic grayling]], a fresh-water game fish closely related to the [[trout]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grayling&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 16 June 1909, sponsored by Miss C. H. Bowles, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 23 November 1909 with [[Lieutenant]] Owen Hill in command. She was renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;D-2&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on 17 November 1911.

==Service history==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;D-2&amp;apos;&amp;apos; joined the Atlantic Torpedo Fleet as Flagboat for Submarine Division 3 (SubDiv 3). Along the Atlantic coast, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;D-2&amp;apos;&amp;apos; joined in diving, [[torpedo]], and experimental exercises. She participated in the Presidential Review of the Fleet in [[North River (Hudson River)|North River]], [[New York City]] from 5–18 May 1915.

During [[World War I]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;D-2&amp;apos;&amp;apos; served in training and experimental work at [[New London, Connecticut]].

On 14 September 1917 she sank at dockside with all hands although the entire crew was rescued.

She was placed in commission, in reserve, at [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] on 9 September 1919 and placed in ordinary on 15 July 1921. Towed to Philadelphia Navy Yard, she was decommissioned on 18 January 1922 and sold as a hulk on 25 September.

While patrolling outside the Newport Naval harbor shortly before 2 pm., Saturday 7 October 1916, just three miles east of Point Judith, the D-2 discovered the German man o’war submarine U53 under the command of Hans Rose heading towards Newport Rhode Island as part of its hitherto unprecedented two-way traversal of the Atlantic without refueling or resupply. There was an initial flurry of activity when the U53 suddenly steamed away to port believing the submerged D-2 to be a British submarine, but when the D-2 surfaced so that a crewman could run aft to raise the American flag the U53 slowed. Lieutenant G.C. Fulker, USN, commander of the D-2 brought his submarine up close on a parallel course to convoy the U53 while in sight of land. As the submarines reached Brenton Reef Lightship captain Rose requested permission from the D-2 to enter port. Fulker granted it, and Hans Rose called back by megaphone “I salute our American comrades and follow in your wake.”[Herzog, Bodo &amp;amp; Schomaekers, Günter, Ritter der Tiefe Graue Wölfe, Die erfolgreichsten U-Boot-Kommandanten der Welt des Ersten un Zweiten Weltkrieges, Verlag Welsermühl München-Wels, 1965, pp.&amp;amp;nbsp;178–9]
