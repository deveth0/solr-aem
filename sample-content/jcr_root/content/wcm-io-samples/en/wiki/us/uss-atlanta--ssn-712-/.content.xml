&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Atlanta&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SSN-712)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a [[Los Angeles class submarine|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Los Angeles&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class submarine]], was the fifth ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The contract to build her was awarded to [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]] on 1 August 1975 and her keel was laid down on 17 August 1978.  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 16 August 1980 sponsored by Mrs. [[Sam Nunn]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 6 March 1982, with Commander Robin J. White in command.

On 29 April 1986 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Atlanta&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ran aground in the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], damaging her [[sonar]] gear and puncturing a ballast tank in the bow section. The boat proceeded to [[Gibraltar]] under her own power.  After a week, the Atlanta returned to Norfolk, VA under its own power, and was repaired in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, VA.

During &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Atlanta&amp;apos;&amp;apos;’s brief career, she completed six deployments to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and three deployments to the western Atlantic.  She was the first submarine certified to employ the [[Mark 48 torpedo]] and both [[Harpoon missile]]s and [[Tomahawk missile]]s. She was also the first nuclear-powered submarine assigned to directly support an [[Amphibious Ready Group]] (ARG).

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Atlanta&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was decommissioned and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 16 December 1999.  Ex-&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Atlanta&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was berthed at the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]], awaiting entry into the Nuclear Powered [[Ship and Submarine Recycling Program]] in [[Bremerton, Washington]].
