&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Saidor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (CVE-117)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Commencement Bay class escort carrier|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Commencement Bay&amp;apos;&amp;apos; class]] [[escort carrier]] of the [[United States Navy]].

Originally named the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Saltery Bay&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, she was renamed on 5 June 1944, was laid down on 29 September 1944 by Todd-Pacific Shipyards, Inc., [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]; launched on 17 March 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Walter F. Boone; and commissioned on 4 September 1945, Capt. A. P. Storrs in command.

Following shakedown off the [[United States]] west coast, she served at [[Pearl Harbor]] from 12 December 1945 to 20 March 1946. Sailing via the [[Panama Canal]], she operated at Norfolk, Va., from 16 April to 22 April, before returning via the Panama Canal to the west coast. Departing [[San Diego]] on 6 May, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Saidor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; arrived at Bikini on the 24th to serve as a photographic laboratory for the atomic bomb testing program, [[Operation Crossroads]]. She processed film, documenting the destructive power of atomic weapons on selected targets at various ranges, during the nuclear explosions of 1 July and 25 July. She departed Bikini on 4 August and returned to San Diego where she remained into 1947, when she began inactivation.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Saidor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was decommissioned on 12 September 1947 and berthed with the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego. Reclassified &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;CVHE-117&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on 12 June 1955, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AKV-17&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on 7 May 1959, she remained in the Reserve Fleet until 1 December 1970 when she was struck from the Navy list. She was sold to American Ship Dismantlers, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oreg., for scrapping on 22 October 1971.
