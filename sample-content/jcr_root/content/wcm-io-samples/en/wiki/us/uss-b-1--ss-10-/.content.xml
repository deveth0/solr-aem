&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;B-1&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SS-10)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[United States B class submarine|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;B&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] [[submarine]] of the [[United States Navy]]. Her keel was laid down by [[Fore River Shipbuilding]] Company in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], under a subcontract from [[Electric Boat]] Company of [[New Suffolk]], Long Island, as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viper&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, making her the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the [[Viperidae|viper]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viper&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 30 March 1907 sponsored by Mrs. [[Lawrence York Spear]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 18 October 1907 with [[Lieutenant]] D. C. Gingham in command. She reported to the Second Submarine Flotilla, [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]].

==Service history==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viper&amp;apos;&amp;apos; cruised along the Atlantic coast on training and experimental exercises until going into reserve at [[Charleston Navy Yard]] on 30 November 1909. Recommissioned on 15 April 1910, she served with the Atlantic Torpedo Fleet until assigned to the Reserve Torpedo Group at Charleston Navy Yard on 9 May 1911. On 17 November, her name was changed to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;B-1&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In April 1914, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;B-1&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was towed to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], and later loaded aboard the [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] {{USS|Hector|AC-7|2}} for transport to the [[Philippine Islands]]. Arriving at [[Olongapo]], [[Luzon]] on 24 March 1915, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;B-1&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was launched from the deck of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hector&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on 15 April and recommissioned two days later.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;B-1&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was assigned to the First Submarine Division, Torpedo Flotilla, [[United States Asiatic Fleet|Asiatic Fleet]] on 19 May 1915 and later served with the Second Submarine Division in [[Manila Bay]]. On 1 December 1921, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;B-1&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was decommissioned at [[Cavite]], Philippine Islands, and subsequently used as a target.
