&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;N-7&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SS-59)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[United States N class submarine|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;N&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class coastal defense submarine]] of the [[United States Navy]].  Her keel was laid down on 20 April 1915 by [[Lake Torpedo Boat]] Company in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]].  N-boats built by Lake had slightly different specifications from the ones built by [[Seattle Construction and Drydock]] and are sometimes considered a separate class.

She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 19 May 1917, sponsored by Mrs Frank Miller, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 15 June 1918, with Lieutenant Walter S. Kass in command.

==Service history==
After outfitting at [[New London, Connecticut]], she patrolled the [[New England]] coast, to guard against attacks by German [[U-boat]]s, until 17 September, when she put into [[New York City]] for upkeep. Returning to New London on 24 October, she remained there until 21 June 1919, when she sailed to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], for extensive overhaul. She returned to New London on 31 March 1920 and remained there until placed in reserve on 7 June.

She spent 1921 in reserve at New London, except for short cruises to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. Later that year, her engines were transferred to a more modern
[[United States L class submarine|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;L&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class submarine]]. Towed by tug {{USS|Lykens|AT-56}}, she departed on 26 January 1922 for Philadelphia, where she decommissioned on 7 February. Her hulk was sold to [[Joseph G. Hitner]] of Philadelphia for scrap on 5 June.
