The [[Continental Navy]] [[frigate]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Deane&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, named after American commissioner to France [[Silas Deane]], was built at [[Nantes]], France, and brought to the United States in May 1778 to be prepared for sea. She was named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hague&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1782, and was taken out of commission in 1783.

==Career==

Under the command of Captain [[Samuel Nicholson]] of the [[Continental Navy]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Deane&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sailed from Boston 14 January 1779 with {{USS|Alliance|1778|2}} for a cruise in the [[West Indies]]. She returned to [[Philadelphia]] 17 April with one prize, the armed ship &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viper&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. On 29 July she joined with {{USS|Boston|1777|6}} and two ships of the [[Virginia Navy]] guarding a [[convoy]] of merchantmen out to sea and continuing on for a five-week cruise which netted eight prizes, including four [[privateer]]s, the [[packet ship|packet]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sandwich&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and the [[sloop-of-war]] {{HMS|Thorn}}. The frigates arrived at Boston 6 September with 250 prisoners after one of the most notable cruises of the Continental Navy.

During the winter and early spring of 1781 and again in 1782 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Deane&amp;apos;&amp;apos; cruised with {{USS|Confederacy|1778|2}} and {{USS|Saratoga|1780|2}} in the West Indies, capturing four prizes on the second of these cruises. In April 1782 she captured the cutter {{HMS|Jackal|1779|6}}.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Demerliac (1996), p.89, #590.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; After two more cruises in the Caribbean, one in September 1782 and the other in 1783. She was renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hague&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in September 1782 (perhaps because of false accusation against Deane that was current at the time).

==Fate==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Deane&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was taken out of commission in 1783 at Boston.
