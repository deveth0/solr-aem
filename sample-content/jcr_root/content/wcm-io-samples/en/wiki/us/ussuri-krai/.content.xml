&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ussuri krai&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Lang-ru|Уссури́йский край}}) is an unofficial name for a part of [[Primorsky Krai]] and [[Khabarovsky Krai]] that consisted of Ussuri and South-Ussuri [[Okrug]]s.  The name was often used in late [[Imperial Russia]]. The name comes from the fact that [[Ussuri River]] is located on the territory of the krai.

Through the efforts of the Russian governor [[Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky]] the [[Qing Dynasty]] of [[China]] conceded its rights to the territory to Russia in 1858. This decision was officially documented in the [[Convention of Peking|Beijing Treaty]] (1860).

In 1889-1918 Ussuri krai was the location of the [[Ussuri Cossack Host]]. It was re-established in the 1990s.

[[National Geographic Channel]] represented the film named &amp;quot;Secret Forest&amp;quot; as the part of the cycle &amp;quot;[[Wild Russia]]&amp;quot; which describes the natural reserves of [[Ussuri Krai]].
