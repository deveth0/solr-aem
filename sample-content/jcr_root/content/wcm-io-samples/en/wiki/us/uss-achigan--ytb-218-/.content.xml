&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Achigan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (YT-218/YTB-218)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Cahto class harbor tug|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cahto&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] [[tugboat|large harbor tug]] in the service of the [[United States Navy]].

She was laid down as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Achigan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (YT-218) on 23 July 1943 at [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]] by [[W. A. Robinson]], reclassified YTB-218 on 15 May 1944, launched on 4 October 1944, and placed in service on 9 January 1945.

==Service history==
Assigned to the [[4th Naval District]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Achigan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; spent most of her naval career at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]]. On the afternoon of 8 January 1946, she sank at Philadelphia as a result of a collision with {{USS|General J. C. Breckinridge|AP-176|3}}. Later salvaged, the tug returned to service at Philadelphia in mid-1947. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Achigan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; served there until the summer of 1956 when she was transferred to the [[6th Naval District]]. The meager record of her service indicates that the tug served in the 6th Naval District into 1957 and was disposed of later that year.
