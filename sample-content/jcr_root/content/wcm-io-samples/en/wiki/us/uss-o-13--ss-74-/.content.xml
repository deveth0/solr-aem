&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;O-13&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SS-74)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[United States O class submarine|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;O&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class submarine]] of the [[United States Navy]].  Her keel was laid down on 6 March 1916 by the [[Lake Torpedo Boat]] Company in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]].

The later O-boats (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;O-11&amp;apos;&amp;apos; through &amp;apos;&amp;apos;O-16&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) were designed by Lake Torpedo Boat to different specifications from the earlier ones designed by Electric Boat. They performed much less well, and are sometimes considered a separate class.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;O-13&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 27 December 1917 sponsored by Miss Margaret Arletta Adams. While conducting submerged trials in [[Long Island Sound]] on 5 October 1918, prior to her commissioning, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;O-13&amp;apos;&amp;apos; rammed {{USS|Mary Alice|SP-397}}, the [[section patrol]] boat accompanying her, during a submerged circular run off [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]], holing &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mary Alice&amp;apos;&amp;apos; amidships. Although &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mary Alice&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sank within minutes, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;O-13&amp;apos;&amp;apos; rescued her entire crew, including [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[William A. Gill]], President of the U.S. Navy&amp;apos;s [[Board of Inspection and Survey]], who had been embarked on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mary Alice&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;O-13&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] at [[New York City]] on 27 November 1918 with [[Lieutenant Commander]] Earl R. Morrissey in command.

==Service history==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;O-13&amp;apos;&amp;apos; operated along the coast of [[New Jersey]] and [[New York]] until 8 October 1919, when she arrived [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] for a five-month overhaul. After returning to [[Cape May, New Jersey]], on 8 March 1920, she departed on 1 April for duty in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Steaming via [[Key West, Florida]], and [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], she arrived [[Coco Solo]], [[Panama Canal Zone]], on 30 April.

For over three years &amp;apos;&amp;apos;O-13&amp;apos;&amp;apos; operated out of the Submarine Base at Coco Solo both in the [[Caribbean Sea]] and in the [[Pacific Ocean]].  Cruises sent her to ports in [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]] while assigned to Submarine Division 10. Thence, she sailed on 15 October 1923 for the [[United States]], arriving at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], on 8 November. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;O-13&amp;apos;&amp;apos; decommissioned there on 11 June 1924 after just five and a half years of service, and was placed in reserve. Her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 9 May 1930, and her hull was sold for scrap on 30 July 1930.
