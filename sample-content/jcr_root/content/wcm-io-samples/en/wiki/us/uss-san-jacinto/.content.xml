Three ships of the [[United States Navy]] have been named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;San Jacinto&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, after the [[Texas]] [[battle of San Jacinto]] in 1836, and the navy considered acquiring a fourth ship of the name:

* The first {{USS|San Jacinto|1850|2}} was an early [[screw frigate]] of the navy, launched in 1850. She bombarded the Taku Forts in support of British and French troops on the ground during the [[Second Opium War]] and was active during the [[American Civil War]], but wrecked at the beginning of 1865. The ship is also known for its role in the [[Trent Affair]].

* The US Navy considered acquiring a civilian passenger-cargo ship, [[SS San Jacinto (1903)|SS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;San Jacinto&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], for use during World War I as USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;San Jacinto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ID-1531), but never acquired or commissioned her.

* The second {{USS|San Jacinto|CVL-30|3}} was a [[light aircraft carrier]] that saw action in the latter half of [[World War II]] and was decommissioned in 1947.

* The third {{USS|San Jacinto|CG-56|3}} is a [[guided missile cruiser]] commissioned in 1988 and is in naval service {{As of|2012|lc=on}}.
