In [[telecommunication]], the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;off-air&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;off-the-air&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has the following meanings:

# In [[radio]] [[telecommunication|communications]] systems, pertaining to a [[radio station]] or [[television station]] that is completely shut down, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;i.e.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; that is not transmitting any [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]], not even an un-[[modulation|modulated]] [[carrier wave]]. Other terms in this context include [[Dark (broadcasting)|&amp;quot;dark&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;silent&amp;quot;]], though those terms were typically used for a station that has left the air for an extended period of time, or permanently; while &amp;quot;off-the-air&amp;quot; is generally used for a brief period of time, or for a station that has recently stopped broadcasting.
# In a radio station, pertaining to a particular source of modulation, such as a specific [[microphone]], that is disconnected, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;i.e.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is no longer capable of modulating the carrier.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Note&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:  The [[carrier wave]] may continue unmodulated or it may be modulated by another signal source, such as a [[subcarrier]].

Also, off-the-air may be [[synonym]]ous with [[Wireless|over-the-air]] or from-the-air, as in picking up a [[terrestrial television|terrestrial]] broadcast [[TV station]] off-the-air instead of from [[cable TV]].  As this usage may be confusing due to the term&amp;apos;s other meanings, the terms &amp;quot;over the air&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;on the air&amp;quot; are more standard in the broadcasting industry.
