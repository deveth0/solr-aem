The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Office of Special Investigations&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a unit within the [[United States Department of Justice Criminal Division|Criminal Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice]]. Its purpose was to detect and investigate individuals who took part in state sponsored acts committed in violation of [[public international law]], such as [[crimes against humanity]].

In 2010, the Office was merged with the [[Domestic Security Section]] to form a new unit of the Criminal Division: the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Ramonas |title=DOJ Creates Human Rights And Special Prosecutions Section |url=http://www.mainjustice.com/2010/03/30/doj-creates-human-rights-and-special-prosecutions-section/ |publisher=MainJustice.com |date=March 30, 2010 |accessdate=July 6, 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
A redacted report about the office&amp;apos;s work was released to the [[National Security Archives]] after a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=195239&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/us/14nazis.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss| title=Nazis Were Given ‘Safe Haven’ in U.S., Report Says| author= ERIC LICHTBLAU| work=The New York Times| date=November 13, 2010 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; A complete report was leaked to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[New York Times]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and according to [[David Sobel]], the redactions were &amp;quot;without legal justification.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB331/index.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==

OSI&amp;apos;s work was primarily focused on acts by [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] abroad before and during [[World War II]], and who subsequently entered, or seek to enter, the United States [[Illegal immigration|illegally]] or [[fraud]]ulently. It then takes appropriate legal action seeking their exclusion, [[Naturalization#Denaturalization|denaturalization]] (revocation of [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizenship]]), and/or [[deportation]].  As of August 2005, OSI had successfully prosecuted 100 persons involved in Nazi [[war crime]]s. These persons have been denaturalized and/or been [[deport]]ed from the [[United States]]. Many had lived in the U.S. for decades and led unremarkable lives. For example, [[Adam Friedrich]] had lived in the U.S. since 1955 and been a citizen since 1962 before OSI found that he had been a member of the [[Waffen-SS]] assigned as a [[prison guard]] at the [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp]]. He was denaturalized in 2004 but died in 2006 before he could be deported.

The number of Nazis in the U.S. and world has dwindled rapidly through natural mortality. As such, the mission of the OSI shifted in its last years from focusing strictly on [[World War II]] criminals to seeking out and prosecuting [[war criminal]]s from the conflicts in [[Bosnian Genocide|Bosnia]], [[Serbia]], [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwanda]], and [[War in Darfur|Darfur]] who have sought refuge by coming to the United States.

==Organization==
The last Director of OSI was [[Eli Rosenbaum]], who worked for OSI on and off since 1980. In 1995, he was appointed Director of the office after having served as its Principal Deputy Director since 1988.  Rosenbaum is now the Director of Strategy and Policy for the new Human Rights and Special Prosecution Section.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.justice.gov/criminal/hrsp/about/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
