In sports, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;offense&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;offence&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-ce, -se|American and British English spelling differences]]; pronounced with first-syllable stress), also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;attack&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is the action of attacking or engaging an opposing team with the objective of scoring points or goals. The term may also refer to the tactics involved in offense, or a sub-team whose primary responsibility is offense.

Generally, [[Goal (sport)|goals]] are scored by teams&amp;apos; offenses, but in sports such as [[American Football]] it is common to see defenses and special teams (which serve as a team&amp;apos;s offensive unit on kicking plays and defensive on returning plays) score as well. The fielding side in Cricket is also generally known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;bowling attack&amp;apos;&amp;apos; despite the batting side being the side that scores runs.

In Britain and elsewhere, the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;offence&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is almost always taken to mean an infraction of the rules, a penalty or foul, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;attack&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is more likely to be used where Americans would use &amp;apos;offense&amp;apos;.
