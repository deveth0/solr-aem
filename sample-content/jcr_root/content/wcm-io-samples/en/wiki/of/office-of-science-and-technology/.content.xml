        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Office of Science and Technology&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;OST&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), later (briefly) named the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Office of Science and Innovation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was a [[non-ministerial government department]] of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|government]] between 1992 and 2007.

The office was responsible for co-ordination of the Government&amp;apos;s [[science and technology]] related activities and policies, and the distribution of some Â£2.4 billion among the seven UK [[Research Council]]s (also see [[Research Councils UK]]). It was headed by the [[Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government|Chief Scientific Adviser]]; initially this was [[William Stewart (scientist)|Sir William Stewart]], then [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Sir Robert (later Lord) May]], and finally [[David King (scientist)|Sir David King]].

The OST was originally formed in 1992 as a merger of the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser with the Science Branch of the [[Department of Education and Science]] (as it then was). Although originally run under the [[Cabinet Office]], it was moved between Departments in 1995 to operate under the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]. In early 2006, the office was renamed to the &amp;quot;Office of Science and Innovation&amp;quot;, and was subsequently absorbed into the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]] in the Summer of 2007 when the Department for Education and Skills was split in two.

The Government Chief Scientific Advisor now heads the [[Government Office for Science]].
