}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Néstor Isaías Chávez Silva&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Major League Baseball]] right-handed [[starting pitcher]] who played for the [[San Francisco Giants]] (1967).

Chávez was born on July 6, 1947 in [[Chacao, Venezuela|Chacao, Miranda State]], [[Venezuela]]. He was signed as an amateur free agent in 1964 after going for a 34–3 record at the college. Chávez was nicknamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;Látigo&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (whip) in his homeland, both for his stunning and sharp [[fastball]].

Listed at 6 feet (1.83 m), 170 pounds (77&amp;amp;nbsp;kg), Chávez was one of the best pitching prospects in the Giants farm system. At nineteen, he was called up to the big club after a combined 47–20 mark in the minors. In two games with the Giants, he compiled a 1–0 record with three [[strike out]]s and a 0.00 [[Earned run average|ERA]] in five innings. After the season he had shoulder surgery and was sidelined for more than a year.

On March 16, 1969, Chávez was ready at the airport in order to start his rehabilitation in the [[Minor league baseball|minors]]. That never happened. He died in [[Maracaibo]], [[Zulia State]], in one of the worst aircraft tragedies in Venezuelan history, [[Viasa Flight 742]] struck power lines while taking off, killing all 84 aboard and 71 on the ground. He was 21 years old.
