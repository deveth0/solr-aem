The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Seven Sisters&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are a series of [[chalk]] [[cliff]]s by the [[English Channel]]. They form part of the [[South Downs]] in [[East Sussex]], between the towns of [[Seaford, East Sussex|Seaford]] and [[Eastbourne]] in southern [[England]].  They are within the Seven Sisters Country Park.  They are the remnants of [[dry valley]]s in the chalk South Downs, which are gradually being eroded by the sea.

The Seven Sisters cliffs are occasionally used in [[filmmaking]] and [[television production]] as a stand-in for the more famous [[White Cliffs of Dover]], since they are relatively free of [[anachronism|anachronistic]] modern development and are also allowed to erode naturally. As a result, the Seven Sisters and Beachy Head remain a bright white colour, whereas the White Cliffs of Dover are protected due to the important port and are therefore increasingly covered in vegetation and are greening as a result. They are also featured at the beginning of the film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]],&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and at the end of the film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Atonement (film)|Atonement]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; where Robbie and Cecilia always wanted to live.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0783233/locations | title=Atonement - Filming Locations |publisher=IMDb |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

From west to east, the sequence starts just east of [[Cuckmere Haven]]. The cliff peaks and the dips between them are individually named.  Listed below, the peaks are in italics.  There are seven hills, with an eighth one being created by the erosion of the sea.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=SgWTuzxzYAQC&amp;amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false |title=Slow South Downs &amp;amp; Sussex Coast |page=177|author=Tim Locke|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|year= 2011|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Just east of the last peak is [[Birling Gap]].  Beyond, on the top of the next hill, is [[Belle Tout lighthouse]] and beyond that [[Beachy Head]].  A lighthouse in the sea marks the latter headland.

The [[South Downs Way]] runs along the edge of the cliffs, taking a very undulating course.

An east-facing photo of the Seven Sisters is included as one of the default landscape wallpapers packaged with [[Microsoft]] [[Windows 7]].

Many landmarks around the area are named after the cliffs, including the [[Seven Sisters Sheep Centre]].
