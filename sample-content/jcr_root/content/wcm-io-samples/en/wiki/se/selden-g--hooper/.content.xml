        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Selden G. Hooper&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (25 December 1904 &amp;amp;ndash; 7 February 1976) was the only [[Admiral]] of the [[United States Navy]] to be convicted by [[court-martial]].

Hooper was the [[ship commissioning|commissioning]] commanding officer of the {{Sclass|Fletcher|destroyer}} {{USS|Uhlmann|DD-687}} on 22 November 1943.

In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;U.S. V. Hooper&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 26 CMR 417 (CMA, 1958), Hooper was tried by general court-martial for [[sodomy]], conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the Armed Forces, and [[conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman]]. Hooper had retired as a [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] in 1950, and the acts for which he was tried were committed after he had retired. The defense questioned the military court&amp;apos;s jurisdiction, but the court explained that &amp;quot;retired personnel are a part of the land or naval forces.&amp;quot; The military retiree, then, is not simply a civilian. The court held that the admiral was &amp;quot;a part of the military forces of this country.&amp;quot; He was described as &amp;quot;an officer of the Navy of the United States, entitled to wear the uniform and to draw pay as such.&amp;quot; He was convicted and sentenced to dismissal and forfeiture of all pay and allowances.

Hooper was the only flag officer of the U.S. Navy to be convicted by court-martial, and strictly speaking, the only Navy flag officer to ever be tried by court-martial.  In 1995 [[Everett L. Greene]] was acquitted of sexual harassment and other related charges; he had been selected for promotion to Rear Admiral but was still a Captain when he was tried.
