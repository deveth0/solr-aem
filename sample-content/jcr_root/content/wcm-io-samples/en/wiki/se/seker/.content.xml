&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Seker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|k|ər}}; also spelled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sokar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[falcon]] god of the [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphite]] [[necropolis]]. Although the meaning of his name remains uncertain, the Egyptians in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pyramid Texts]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; linked his name to the anguished cry of [[Osiris]] to [[Isis]] &amp;apos;Sy-k-ri&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;hurry to me&amp;apos;),&amp;lt;ref name=rout415&amp;gt;The Routledge Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses, George Hart ISBN 0-415-34495-6&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; in the [[underworld]]. Seker is strongly linked with two other gods, [[Ptah]] the chief god of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and Osiris [[Duat|the god of the dead]]. In later periods this connection was expressed as the triple god &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ptah-Seker-Osiris&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Seker was usually depicted as a mummified [[hawk]] and sometimes as mound from which the head of a hawk appears. Here he is called &amp;apos;he who is on his [[Sand|sand&amp;apos;]]. Sometimes he is shown on his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;hennu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; barque which was an elaborate sledge for negotiating the sandy necropolis. One of his titles was &amp;apos;He of Restau&amp;apos; which means the place of &amp;apos;openings&amp;apos; or tomb entrances.

In the [[New Kingdom]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Book of the Underworld&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Amduat]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, he is shown standing on the back of a serpent between two spread wings, as an expression of freedom this suggests a connection with resurrection or perhaps a satisfactory transit of the underworld.&amp;lt;ref name=rout415 /&amp;gt; Despite this the region of the underworld associated with Seker was seen as difficult, sandy terrain called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Imhet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (meaning &amp;apos;filled up&amp;apos;).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Egyptian Amduat&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Erik Hornung]] and [[Theodore Abt]] ISBN 3-9522608-4-3&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Seker, possibly through his association with Ptah, also has a connection with craftsmen. In the [[Book of the Dead]] he is said to fashion [[silver]] bowls&amp;lt;ref name=rout415 /&amp;gt; and a silver coffin of [[Sheshonq II]] has been discovered at [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]] decorated with the iconography of Seker.&amp;lt;ref name=tcggoae&amp;gt;The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt, Wilkinson ISBN 0-500-05120-8&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In the 1956 movie [[The Ten Commandments]], the [[Pharaoh]] [[Rameses II]] invokes the same deity to bring his deceased firstborn son back to life, while portrayed as wearing dark blue robe with a silver bow.

Seker&amp;apos;s cult centre was in Memphis where festivals in his honour were held in the fourth month of the akhet (spring) season. The god was depicted as assisting in various tasks such as digging ditches and canals. From the New Kingdom a similar festival was held in Thebes.&amp;lt;ref name=tcggoae /&amp;gt;
