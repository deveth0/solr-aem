&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sextans&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a minor [[celestial equator|equatorial]] [[constellation]] which was introduced in 1687 by [[Johannes Hevelius]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for the [[sextant (astronomical)|astronomical sextant]], an instrument that Hevelius made frequent use of in his observations.

==Notable features==
[[Image:SextansCC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The constellation Sextans as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]
Sextans as a [[constellation]] covers a rather dim, sparse region of the sky.  It has only one star above the [[apparent magnitude|fifth magnitude]], namely [[Alpha Sextantis|α Sextantis]] at 4.49&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;m&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;.  The constellation contains a few [[double star]]s, including [[Gamma Sextantis|γ]], [[35 Sextantis|35]], and [[40 Sextantis]].  There are a few notable [[variable star]]s, including [[Beta Sextantis|β]], [[25 Sextantis|25]], [[23 Sextantis]], and [[LHS 292]]. [[NGC 3115]], an edge-on lenticular galaxy, is the only noteworthy deep-sky object. It also lies near the ecliptic, which causes the [[Moon]], and some of the planets to occasionally pass through it for brief periods of time.

The constellation is the location of the field studied by the [[Cosmic Evolution Survey|COSMOS project]], undertaken by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].

[[Sextans B]] is a fairly bright [[dwarf irregular galaxy]] at magnitude 6.6, 4.3 million light-years from Earth. It is part of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=178}}
