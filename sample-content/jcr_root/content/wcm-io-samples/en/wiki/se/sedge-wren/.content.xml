The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sedge Wren&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cistothorus platensis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a small [[songbird]] of the [[Wren]] family. It was formerly known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Short-billed Marsh Wren&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and in South America is often known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grass Wren&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. There are about 20 different [[subspecies]] which are found across most of the [[Americas]]. Some of these forms may be separate species that could be split in the future.

Adults have brown upperparts with a light brown belly and flanks and a white throat and  breast. The back has pale streaks. They have a dark cap with pale streaks, a faint line over the eye and a short thin [[beak|bill]]. They are one of the smallest species of wren at 10–12 cm (3.9-4.7 in) and 10-12 grams (0.35-0.4  oz).

In North America, their breeding habitat is wet meadows and marsh edges of eastern North America and central Canada. The [[bird nest|nest]] is a round lump attached to low vegetation, entered from the side; it is usually well-hidden. The male often builds several unused nests in his territory; he may puncture the [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s of other birds nesting nearby. In South America, they are associated with very different habitats, principally [[páramo]] at very high elevations (3000 meters and above).

North American populations [[bird migration|migrate]] to coastal areas in the [[Southeastern United States]], and the entire [[Gulf Coast]] south through eastern Mexico.

These birds forage low in vegetation, sometimes flying up to catch insects in flight. They mainly eat insects, also [[spider]]s.

The [[bird song|song]] of the male in North American populations is a rattling trill. The song of Central and South American forms is far more variable.

This bird&amp;apos;s numbers are declining, possibly due to [[habitat loss]].
