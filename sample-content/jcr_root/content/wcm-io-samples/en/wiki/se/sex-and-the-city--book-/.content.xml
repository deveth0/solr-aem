&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sex and the City&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a collection of essays by [[Candace Bushnell]] based on her and her friends&amp;apos; lifestyles. It was first published in 1997, and re-published in 2001, 2006, and in 2008 as a 10th anniversary movie tie-in edition.

The book is an anthology of columns that Bushnell began writing in 1994 for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The New York Observer]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The book was loosely adapted into a long-running [[HBO]] television series also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sex and the City]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1998â€“2004), which itself spawned a 2008 [[Sex and the City (film)|film of the same name]] and a 2010 [[Sex and the City 2|sequel]], but written under the fictional version of herself, [[Carrie Bradshaw]].

==Prequel series==
A prequel series of novels, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Carrie Diaries]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was written in 2010 and adapted into a 2013 TV series on CW.
