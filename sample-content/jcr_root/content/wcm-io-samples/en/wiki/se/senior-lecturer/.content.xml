        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Senior lecturer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[academic rank]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Senior Lecturers | work=[[Times Higher Education]] | url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/jobs_category.asp?cc=10233 | location=UK | accessdate=9 August 2012 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]], [[lecturer]] is a faculty position at a university or similar institution. Especially in research-intensive universities, lecturers lead research groups and supervise research students, as well as teach. After a number of years, lecturers might be promoted to senior lecturers with increasing research, leadership, and administrative responsibilities.

In most research-intensive universities (such as those that are part of the [[Russell Group]] and [[1994 Group]]), a senior lecturer position is between a [[lecturer]] and a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]], with a strong focus on research. At the same time, in some universities (for instance Leeds University), the rank of Reader is no longer used for new appointments. A senior lecturer position can be a parallel position to reader in other universities, senior lecturers typically concentrating more on teaching and readers concentrating more on research with a view to promotion to a full [[professor]] position.

In most UK universities, Senior Lecturer is equivalent to the level of &amp;quot;[[associate professor]]&amp;quot; in North American universities, and &amp;quot;Lecturer&amp;quot; is roughly equivalent to the North American &amp;quot;assistant professor&amp;quot;. Some British Universities (for instance, Nottingham and Warwick) have recently decided to adopt the North American ranks of assistant and associate professor instead of lecturer and senior lecturer/reader.

However, in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and other countries influenced by their educational systems, the term is used differently, generally denoting academics without tenure who teach full or part-time but have few or no research responsibilities within the institution where they teach.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=See, for example, Job Description at Univ WA | url=http://www.washington.edu/admin/acadpers/job_descriptions/Senior_Lecturer_FullTime.html | location=US | accessdate=19 March 2013 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Senior lecturers have substantial experience and accomplishments in their field and possess a doctorate or its professional equivalent (see for example, job description at Columbia University, Officers of Instruction webpage.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.columbia.edu/cu/vpaa/handbook/instruction.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Also, in some schools it&amp;apos;s a temporary post for visiting academics of considerable prominenceâ€”e.g. a famous writer may serve for a term or a year, for instance.
