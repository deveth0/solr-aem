The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Second World&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refers to the former [[Socialism|socialist]], [[Developed country|industrial states]] (formally the [[Eastern Bloc]]), the territory and the influence of the [[Soviet Union]]. Following [[World War II]], there were nineteen [[communist state]]s, and after the fall of the Soviet Union, only five [[socialist state]]s remained: [[China]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]], [[North Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]. Along with &amp;quot;[[First World]]&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;[[Third World]]&amp;quot;, the term was used to divide the nations of Earth into three broad categories. In other words, the concept of &amp;quot;Second World&amp;quot; was a construct of the [[Cold War]] and the term has largely fallen out of use since the [[revolutions of 1989]], though it is still used to describe countries that are in between poverty and prosperity, many of which are socialist and former socialist states today. Subsequently, the actual meaning of the terms &amp;quot;First World&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Third World&amp;quot; changed from being based on political ideology to an economic definition (see the terms &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[developed country]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[developing country]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). This might also cause semantic variation of the term between ascribing a region&amp;apos;s political entities and its people.&amp;lt;ref name=Sociology&amp;gt;{{Cite book |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=vbu2gis26C0C&amp;amp;pg=PA42&amp;amp;lpg=PA42&amp;amp;dq=second+world+countries+communist |title = Sociology |author = Giddens, Anthony |publisher = Polity |year = 2006 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
