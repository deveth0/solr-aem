&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zophar&amp;apos;s Domain&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[emulator|emulation]] [[website]] founded on November 9, 1996 by Brad Levicoff. The site&amp;apos;s name comes from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Lunar Eternal Blue]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on [[Sega CD]], [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] and [[PlayStation]]. On September 20, 2000, the site was passed on to Sam Michaels, previously the site&amp;apos;s [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] programmer.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.zophar.net/oldnews/2000_09.html News Archive - September 2000]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Zophar&amp;apos;s Domain was intended as an &amp;quot;emulation hub,&amp;quot; a congregation of wares and enthusiasts. The site was maintained by a number of people with unique [[Screen name (computing)|&amp;quot;handles&amp;quot;]] who focused on a particular area of emulation. The frequency of news updates gradually decreased after the founder was no longer associated with the site. It features news and downloads for [[emulator]]s, translation [[Patch (computing)|patch]]es, utilities, [[ROM hacking|hacks]], and [[video game music]]. Within the online video game emulation community it was often referred to as &amp;quot;ZD.&amp;quot;

==Present state==
From November 2006 to June 17, 2008, Zophar&amp;apos;s Domain was inactive. Michaels has stated that it should be considered an &amp;quot;archive.&amp;quot; In its prime, it was generally regarded as an excellent news resource, reporting on every area of emulation development. It had high coverage and popularity according to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=zophar.net Site Information for: zophar.net]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On November 9, 2006, Zophar&amp;apos;s Domain&amp;apos;s 10-year anniversary, the site was voluntarily closed. Michaels promptly received an outpouring of support, proving that the site has a loyal [[fanbase]], and restored the site for the foreseeable future after approximately 12 hours.

The logo was modified in late September 2006 and a cat was added sitting on the logo, on the insistence of several forumers.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.zophar.net/wwwthreads/showflat.php?Cat=&amp;amp;Board=diaries&amp;amp;Number=288469&amp;amp;page=&amp;amp;view=&amp;amp;sb=&amp;amp;o=&amp;amp;vc=1] (registration required)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On June 17, 2008, a message on the site replaced the one stating archival, claiming that Zophar&amp;apos;s Domain would be re-opening, and anyone interested in helping update the site should contact the webmaster, as well as the addition of a new forum system replacing the outdated WWWThreads{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

==Legal troubles==
On February 19, 2002, [[Nintendo of America]] invoked the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] and sent a letter to Zophar&amp;apos;s Domain demanding that they stop selling [[Game Boy Advance flash cartridge|Game Boy Advance Flash Linkers]] and turn over remaining stock to Nintendo.  They stopped selling the devices, but the stock was never confiscated.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://slashdot.org/yro/02/02/20/1627204.shtml NOA to Sue for Flash Advance Linkers]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.zophar.net/getnews.phtml?num=3857 From: Nintendo of America, To: ZD]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

As of July 2012, Zophar&amp;apos;s Domain no longer provides commercial [[ROM image|ROMs]] and [[ISO image|ISO]]s; they only provide public domain ROMs now.
