        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zosimus the Bearded&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Зосима Брадатый&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Russian language|Russian]]) (died 1494) was [[metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of [[Moscow]] and all [[Russia]] from 1490. He was the author of the [[Third Rome]] conception.

For the first time in Russian history, Zosimus was appointed metropolitan by the decision of the council of the Russian [[bishop]]s by order of the [[Grand Prince]] [[Ivan III]].  He had been archimandrite of the Simonovskii Monastery in Moscow when he was picked to replace Metropolitan Gerontii some six months after Gerontii&amp;apos;s death.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;E. E. Golubinskii, Istoriia russkoi tserkvi, vol. 2, pt. 1, p. 567.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Archbishop of Novgorod|Archbishop]] [[Gennady (Archbishop of Novgorod)|Gennady]] of [[Novgorod]] had uncovered the Judaizer heresy in 1487 and Zosimus&amp;apos;s entire metropolitanate was overshadowed by this crisis.  Gennady wrote a letter in 1490 to Zosimus and other bishops in the Russian church demanding a council be convened and the heresy be dealt with. The council convened less than a month after Zosimus&amp;apos; elevation to the metropolitan throne and condemned the heresy.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Golubinskii, vol. 2, pt. 1, p. 570.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Gennady demanded that the heretics be severely punished - hanged and burned - and not merely incarcerated, but Zosimus and Grand Prince Ivan III opposed these harsher methods.   Zosimus was eventually accused of being a secret heretic and, on May 17, 1494, he was removed from the metropolitan throne on charges of heresy and sodomy.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Golubinskii, vol. 2, pt. 1, p. 577.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  He died before any trial was held.

Zosimus is known for having compiled a list of [[banned books]] and written an [[epistle]] against [[heresy|heretic]]s.
