&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zoo Diaries&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a Canadian documentary television series airing on [[Life Network]]. The series documents the live of animals and people at a zoo with a record of breeding endangered species. 74 episodes have been produced since 2000 by DocuTainment Productions.

Each episode opens with a brief description of the show&amp;apos;s contents. Events in the life of three or four animals are shown, cutting between stories every couple of minutes. Each story focuses on an animal in an interesting situation, and the zoo person responsible for handling the situation. Some situations are resolved over a number of episodes, for example, developing and performing an animal show designed to startle the audience. Topics vary from birth to death. Handlers discuss situations and difficulties in frank terms, and scenes are occasionally shown that might be disturbing for young children.

The series is candid about the zoo employees&amp;apos; behavior and opinions.

It is filmed at the [[Toronto Zoo]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]] and narrated by [[Vince Corazza]].

Episodes 1-37 are available on DVD.
