{{Eastern name order|Tildy Zoltán}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zoltán Tildy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (18 November 1889 – 4 August 1961), was an influential leader of [[Hungary]], who served as [[Prime Minister of Hungary|Prime Minister]] from 1945–1946 and [[President of Hungary|President]] from 1946–1948 in the post-war period before the seizure of power by Soviet-backed communists.

== Biography ==
He was born in [[Losonc]] ([[Lučenec]] now in [[Slovakia]]), in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] to the family of a Hungarian official in the local government. He took a degree in theology from the Reformed Theological Academy in Pápa, afterwards spending a year studying at the Belfast Assembly College in [[Ireland]]. He served as an active minister of the Reformed Church beginning in 1921, and edited the daily paper of the Reformed church in Hungary, the Keresztény Család (Christian Family), as well as other periodicals. In 1929, he joined the [[Independent Smallholders&amp;apos; Party]] (FKgP) with other noted Hungarian political figures, including [[Ferenc Nagy]]. He became executive vice-president of the organization soon afterwards.

He was elected to the Hungarian parliament, being reëlected in 1936 and 1939. He put pressure on [[Horthy]]&amp;apos;s government to pull out of the [[Second World War]]. After Hungary was occupied by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]], Tildy was forced into hiding. After the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] liberated Hungary from the Germans, Tildy became leader of the FKgP. He became [[Prime Minister of Hungary]], serving from 15 November 1945 to 1 February 1946, when Tildy was elected [[President of Hungary]]. He was an ex officio member of the [[High National Council]] from 7 December 1945 to 2 February 1946.

He served as the first President of the Republic of Hungary until 31 July 1948, when he was forced to resign after allegations emerged about his son-in-law being arrested for corruption and adultery. Tildy was held under house arrest in [[Budapest]] until 1 May 1956. He was appointed to the position of a state minister in the coalition government during the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]]. He was eventually arrested by Soviet forces after the revolution was crushed by [[Warsaw Pact]] intervention. On 15 June 1958, he was sentenced by the Supreme Court to six years&amp;apos; imprisonment, in the trial of Imre Nagy and associates. However, he was released under an individual amnesty in April 1959 in view of his advanced years (in fact due to illness). He then lived in complete retirement until he died in [[Budapest]].
