&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zombie Hotel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an animated children&amp;apos;s program about a hotel run by zombies, produced by French production company [[Alphanim]] and shown internationally. The main characters are Fungus and Maggot, two child [[zombie]]s who pretend to be human to get into their local school, and their family and boarders at the hotel run by their parents. They make friends with Sam, a human boy whose mother is away most of the time. Sam soon finds out about their zombie powers and all three make a team of friends. Sam uses an old railway carriage as his haunt. The plot often involves a risk of the discovery of Maggot and Fungus&amp;apos; zombie nature and the three trying to prevent this. The hotel itself is one of several main locations used in the show. Others include the school and Sam&amp;apos;s railway carriage.
