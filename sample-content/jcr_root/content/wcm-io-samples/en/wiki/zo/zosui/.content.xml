&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zōsui&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (雑炊) is a [[Japan]]ese [[rice]] [[soup]] made from pre-cooked [[rice]] and water. [[Okayu]], which is a similar dish to Zosui, is rice cooked to a watery consistency.

Zosui (which is also called ojiya, a name considered to have originated from the Spanish word [[Olla]]) and [[Okayu]], while similar, are two separate dishes. While the two dishes both contain rice, and both are traditionally eaten when people are feeling unwell, okayu is a kind of porridge (similar to oatmeal), while zosui is akin to a vegetable soup with lots of rice.

Leftover soup from [[Nabemono|nabe]] is often re-used for zosui. Instead of rice, [[udon]] and [[ramen]] noodles are recent alternatives.
