&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zond 3&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a 1964 [[space probe]] sent toward [[Mars]] as a [[spacecraft]] test.  It was a member of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Zond program]] sharing designation Zond, while being part of Mars 3MV project. It was unrelated to Zond spacecraft designed for manned circumlunar mission ([[Soyuz 7K-L1]]). Zond 3 completed a successful Lunar flyby, taking a number of good quality photographs for its time. It is believed that Zond 3 was initially designed as a companion spacecraft to [[Zond 2]] to be launched to Mars during the 1964 launch window. The opportunity to launch was missed, and the spacecraft was launched on a Mars trajectory as a spacecraft test, even though Mars was no longer attainable.

== Spacecraft design ==
The spacecraft design was similar to [[Zond 2]], in addition to the imaging equipment it carried a [[magnetometer]], [[ultraviolet]] (0.25 to 0.35 micrometre and 0.19 to 0.27 micrometre) and [[infrared]] (3 to 4 micrometre) [[spectrograph]]s, [[radiation sensor]]s (gas-discharge and scintillation counters), a [[radiotelescope]] and a [[micrometeoroid]] instrument. It also had an experimental [[ion engine]].

== Mission ==

[[Image:Zond3mosaic.jpg|thumb|left|Mosaic of all the Zond 3 images created with modern image processing tools.]]
The spacecraft, a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mars 3MV-4A&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was launched from a [[Tyazheliy Sputnik]] (65-056B) earth orbiting platform towards the [[Moon]] and interplanetary space. The spacecraft was equipped with an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;f/&amp;apos;&amp;apos;106&amp;amp;nbsp;mm camera and TV system that provided automatic inflight film processing. On July 20 lunar flyby occurred approximately 39 hours after launch at a closest approach of 9200&amp;amp;nbsp;km. 23 photographs and 3 ultraviolet spectra of very good quality were taken of the lunar farside from distances of 11,570 to 9960&amp;amp;nbsp;km over a period of 68 minutes. The photos covered 19,000,000&amp;amp;nbsp;km² of the lunar surface. Zond 3 proceeded on a Mars trajectory, but not at a time when planetary encounter would occur. To test telemetry, the images were rewound and transmitted at 2.2 million km, 31.5 million km and possibly again at greater distances, thus proving the ability of the communications system. The mission was ended and radio contact ceased when it was at a distance of 150 million km.
