&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zofia Romer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 16, 1885 – August 23, 1972), née Zofia Dembowska was a Polish painter. She was born in 1885 in [[Estonia]] to well-known physician Tadeusz Dembowski and his wife Matylda. She grew up in [[Lithuania]] and [[Poland]] studying under various painters. As a young woman she was romantically linked with [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Michael Young, Malinowski: Odyssey of an Anthropologist, 1884-1920, Yale University Press, 2004&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Education==
In Lithuania, she studied painting first under [[Trutniev]] in [[Vilnius]] and subsequently under Roth and [[Holoszy]] in [[Krakow, Poland]] and [[Munich, Germany]]. In 1903 and 1904, she continued her studies in Paris with the well known portrait painter [[Jacques-Émile Blanche]] and the historical painter [[Luc-Olivier Merson]]. She completed her formal artistic education back in Krakow with Józef Siedlecki at the [[Baraniecki Museum]].

==Marriage and career==
In 1911 she married Eugeniusz Romer, a wealthy and influential Polish landowner in Lithuania. Mrs. Romer played a significant role in the artistic heritage of Lithuania. During a prolific artistic career spanning almost 70 years and encompassing a variety of media, she produced about 5000 works, of which at least 1200 are catalogued. From 1943 onward she earned her living as a portrait painter.

As a result of her displacement from her home during [[World War II]], in the second half of her life she lived and created in such diverse places as the Russian Federation, Tehran, Cairo, London, the United States, and Montreal, Canada, where she died in 1972.

Her work hangs in the collections of many museums in Eastern Europe including the State Museums of Kaunas, Siauliai, Telsiai, Kelme, and Vilnius, and the National Museum in Warsaw, as well as numerous private collections all over the world.

In 1992 a catalogue of her known work was published in connection with a multiple museum exhibition of her work.
