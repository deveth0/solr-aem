==Biography==
Born in [[Hawthorne, California]], Harkleroad was trained as an [[accordionist]] as a child but switched to [[guitar]] in his teens. In nearby [[Lancaster, California]], he became involved in local bands.  He joined up with future member of the [[Magic Band]], [[Mark Boston]], in a band named B.C. &amp;amp; The Cavemen. Later the two played in the group Blues in a Bottle along with future Magic Band guitarist [[Jeff Cotton]]. He joined the Magic Band in 1968 after the departure of [[Alex St. Clair]]. After recording &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Trout Mask Replica]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and several further albums, he left in 1974, with several other band members, to form [[Mallard (band)|Mallard]].  His book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lunar Notes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; describes some of the tensions that contributed to the split between [[Captain Beefheart]] and the other band members.

After the disbanding of Mallard, he had a limited involvement with the music community as a performer.  He continued his involvement in another capacity, however, as a record [[store manager]] and guitar instructor in [[Eugene, Oregon]].

On November 27, 2001, he released &amp;apos;&amp;apos;We Saw a Bozo Under the Sea&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 2008 [[John French (musician)|John French]] (a.k.a. Drumbo) released an album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;City of Refuge&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in which Harkleroad was featured playing guitar on all twelve tracks.
