        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ZonePerfect&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the manufacturer of health food products, known for their [[energy bar|nutrition bar]]s and shakes, created to comply with the [[Zone diet]].  The brand is a part of the Ross Productions Division of [[Abbott Laboratories]] and is commonly available in grocery stores in the United States.  Their nutrition bars are available in 15 different flavors, each containing at least 15 grams of [[protein]], while their shakes are available in either vanilla or chocolate and contain 19 grams of protein.  The Zone Perfect company is located in [[Columbus, Ohio]].

All ZonePerfect meals are based on the ratio 40:30:30 - in other words, the food they market is 40% carbohydrates, 30% protein and 30% fat.

ZonePerfect frequently sponsors competitive events, such as the [[San Francisco Marathon]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.ktvu.com/news/9599239/detail.html Results Are In For San Francisco Marathon], KTVU.com&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The package claims they are &amp;quot;All-Natural Nutrition Bars&amp;quot;, but note that the Chocolate Mint flavored bar contains [[sorbitan monostearate]], an emulsifier with incompletely researched toxicology.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://physchem.ox.ac.uk/MSDS/SO/sorbitan_monostearate.html MSDS for sorbitan monostearate], Oxford University&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
