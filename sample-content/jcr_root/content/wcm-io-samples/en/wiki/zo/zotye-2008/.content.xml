The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zotye 2008&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small 5-door [[SUV]] produced by [[Zotye International|Zotye Auto]] in [[Zhejiang]], [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China|China]]. A facelifted version is sold as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zotye 5008&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and is known in export markets as Nomad and Hunter. The car is named in honour of the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]] and also goes by the model project number XS6402.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Although it has been alleged that the car is a copy of the [[Daihatsu Terios]] which has been made in China as the [[Huali]] Dario and by the [[Anhui Anchi Motor]] firm, and it has been noted that whilst the front treatment of the grill differs considerably, the rear of the car is nearly identical, the presses for the body panels and associated parts were in fact purchased from [[Daihatsu|Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd.]], Japan, in 2006 when DMC launched the new generation [[Terios]].
