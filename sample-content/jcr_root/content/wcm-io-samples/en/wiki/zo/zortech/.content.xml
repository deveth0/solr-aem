        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zortech Ltd&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a small [[United Kingdom|British]] software [[company (law)|company]] that marketed [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] compilers and associated software.

The company was initially formed with the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zorland Ltd&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to reflect its desire to be a direct competitor of [[Borland]] Inc. This was later changed to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zortech Ltd&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to avoid confusion.

Once established with a [[Europe]]an market for their software, they created a sister company in the [[United States]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zortech Inc&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. At the same time the parent company was renamed again to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zortech International Ltd&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to reflects its expanded market.

The company was eventually taken over in 1991 by [[Symantec]] Inc who wanted access to their compiler technology.

The Zortech compilers are the base on which the [[Digital Mars]] compilers have been developed.
