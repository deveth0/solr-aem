        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zoan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Hebrew: Tso&#x60;an) was according to the [[Hebrew Bible]], a city of Egypt in the eastern [[Nile delta]]. Numbers 13:22 says that it was built seven years after [[Hebron]] was built. Psalm 78:12,43 identifies the &amp;quot;field of Zoan&amp;quot; as where Moses performed miracles before Pharaoh to persuade him to release Israel from his service.  The fields of Zoan are thus considered to be another name for the [[Land of Goshen]]. The city is also mentioned in Isaiah 19:11, 13, Isaiah 30:4 and Ezekiel 30:14.

The Greek [[Septuagint]] in all of these verses uses the Greek name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Tanis]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; both &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tanis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tso&amp;apos;an&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are ultimately derived from the Egyptian name for Tanis, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Djanet&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Djan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Modern Arabic &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tsan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). This city was not actually built until ca. 1075 BC, however references to Zoan existing previously as early as the time of [[Abraham]] are taken to mean the old [[Hyksos]] capital at [[Avaris]] and the nearby Ramesside capital of [[Pi-Ramesses]], about 25 km. from the site of Tanis. The mentions in Isaiah and Ezekiel certainly correspond with the later Tanis.
