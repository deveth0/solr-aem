The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Souhegan River&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a tributary of the [[Merrimack River]] in the northeastern United States. {{Convert|33.8|mi}}&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.granit.sr.unh.edu New Hampshire GRANIT state geographic information system]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; long with a drainage area of {{convert|171|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, it flows north and east through southern [[New Hampshire]] to the Merrimack River.

The river begins in [[New Ipswich, New Hampshire]], at the junction of the river&amp;apos;s [[South Branch Souhegan River|South Branch]] and [[West Branch Souhegan River|West Branch]].  Flowing northeast, it passes through the center of [[Greenville, New Hampshire|Greenville]] and descends through a narrow valley to [[Wilton, New Hampshire|Wilton]], where it turns east.  The river valley broadens below Wilton, and the river passes through the center of [[Milford, New Hampshire|Milford]], crosses the southern portion of [[Amherst, New Hampshire|Amherst]], and enters the town of [[Merrimack, New Hampshire|Merrimack]].  Shortly upstream of the town center, the river passes over Wildcat Falls, then crosses under the [[Everett Turnpike]] and [[U.S. Route 3]] to reach the Merrimack River.  A [[USGS]] river gauge is located [http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?01094000 here].

The river is used for [[water supply|water supplies]], a small amount of [[hydropower]], and recreation. There are 28 threatened or [[endangered species]] sharing the [[drainage basin|watershed]] with 35,000 people. It is part of the New Hampshire Rivers Management Protection Program.

It was one of two rivers studied by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services to reach data and recommendations about allowable &amp;quot;instream flow&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/water/wmb/rivers/instream/souhegan/study_task5.htm NHDES Souhegan River instream flow study]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Etymology==
The name &amp;quot;Souhegan&amp;quot; comes from the language of the Native American [[Algonquin language|Algonquins]], meaning &amp;quot;waiting and watching place&amp;quot;.  Tribal fishermen set [[Fishing weir|weirs]] across the [[rapids]], and then waited and watched for fish, including [[salmon]], [[alewives]], [[sturgeon]], and [[eel]]s.

The name of [[Skowhegan, Maine]] comes from the same term.
