        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Socialist Solidarity Network&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a grouping of [[socialism|socialists]] in the [[United Kingdom]] most of whom are former members of the [[Socialist Party (England and Wales)|Socialist Party]]. They supported the [[Socialist Alliance (England)|Socialist Alliance]] in [[England]] and support the [[Scottish Socialist Party]] in [[Scotland]].

The SSN&amp;apos;s supporters included [[Lesley Mahmood]], a long-time member of the [[Militant tendency]] and Phil Hearse, former editor of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Socialist Outlook]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 2002, the Network absorbed the [[Socialist Democracy Group]]. In 2003, launched the publication &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Socialist Resistance]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; together with the [[International Socialist Group]].

The group ceased to function in the 2000s, as SR transformed itself into the USFI section in Britain, effectively re-absorbing some people such as Phil Hearse, while others such as Lesley Mahmood and Mandy Baker were no longer involved.
