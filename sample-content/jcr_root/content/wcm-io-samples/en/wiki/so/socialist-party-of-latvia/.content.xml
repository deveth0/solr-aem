The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Socialist Party of Latvia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-lv|Latvijas Sociālistiskā partija}}, LSP, {{lang-ru|Социалистическая партия Латвии}}) was formed in 1994 as a successor party to the [[Communist Party of Latvia]], which was banned in 1991. In essence, the party is [[communist]];&amp;lt;ref name=pae /&amp;gt; according to the programme of the party, the LSP was founded as an organization upholding socialist ideas after the 1991 events that the party describes as a &amp;apos;counter-revolutionary bourgeois-nationalist coup&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.latsocpartija.lv/userfiles/LSP%20programma%202005%20RU%281%29.pdf&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The current president of the party is [[Alfrēds Rubiks]], once mayor of [[Riga]] and later leader of the unionist movement and head of the Latvian Communist Party (CPSU platform). He was imprisoned for six years in 1991 on charges of participating in a [[coup d&amp;apos;état]] against the Latvian authorities in August 1991. He is not one of the party&amp;apos;s members in the [[Saeima]] (Latvian Parliament) since he is not allowed to contest elections. However, his son Artūrs Rubiks is a member of Saeima, representing the Socialist Party.

The LSP is more popular among the [[Russian language|Russian-speaking]] population of Latvia. It places a high priority on issues important to ethnic [[Russians]], such as language and citizenship laws. The party also believes that Latvian citizenship should be granted to all citizens of USSR living in Latvia in 1990. This would entail a major change in the current law which only gives automatic citizenship to descendants of people who were citizens of the Republic of Latvia before it was [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940|occupied]] by the Soviet Union in 1940 and requires the Soviet citizens who moved to Latvia between 1940 and 1990 (mainly Russians) to go through a [[naturalization]] process.

In the [[elections in Latvia|election]], on 5 October 2002, the party was part of the [[For Human Rights in United Latvia]] ({{lang-lv|Par cilvēka tiesībām vienotā Latvijā}}) coalition that won 19.0% of the popular vote and 25 out of 100 seats. (5 of those seats went to Socialist Party.) The party was a member of this alliance of predominantly Russian-speaking parties from 1998 to 2003.

Today, the party&amp;apos;s platform is centered on anti-corruption and promoting an independent Latvia that is free from [[European Union|EU]] centralised power. In 2005, the LSP entered the &amp;quot;[[Harmony Centre]]&amp;quot; coalition, which won 17 seats in the 2006 election. 4 of these 17 parliament members are representatives of the Socialist Party. In 2011, HC won 31 seat, with socialists receiving 3 seats (Ar. Rubiks, R. Rubiks and I. Zujevs).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.latsocpartija.lv/lapas_lv/11_saeima.html Sociālisti 11.Saeimā]{{lv icon}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
