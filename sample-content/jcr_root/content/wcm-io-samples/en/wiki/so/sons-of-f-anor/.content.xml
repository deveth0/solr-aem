        text="&lt;p&gt;In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]&amp;apos;s world of [[Middle-earth]], the  seven &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;sons of [[Fëanor]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the eldest prince of the [[Noldor]], led their people from [[Valinor]] to rule over kingdoms in the Northeast of [[Beleriand]]:

* [[Maedhros]] the Tall, who ruled over the &amp;quot;March of Maedhros&amp;quot;, from his base on the hill of [[Himring]]
* [[Maglor]] the Mighty Singer, who ruled over [[Maglor&amp;apos;s Gap]]
* [[Celegorm]] the Fair, who ruled over [[Himlad]] with Curufin
* [[Caranthir]] the Dark, who ruled over [[Thargelion]]
* [[Curufin]] the Crafty, who ruled over [[Himlad]] with Celegorm
* [[Amrod]] and [[Amras]], also known as the Hunters.

They and their father led the Noldor from Valinor to [[Beleriand]] in pursuit of [[Morgoth]], who stole [[Fëanor]]&amp;apos;s greatest work, the [[Silmaril]]s. Since Fëanor died in an early battle, his sons were the driving force behind the ensuing wars. Their heroism was great and they were mighty leaders and foes of Morgoth, but because of the Oath of Fëanor (which they all swore) their actions were also sometimes evil.

Only one survived the [[First Age]]. Because of the nature of their Oath—that they would not permit &amp;apos;&amp;apos;anyone&amp;apos;&amp;apos; else to have the Silmarils, not even other Elves—their deaths were generally not in battle with Morgoth but rather in desperate, Oath-driven assaults on other [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]]. The only three not killed in such a manner were Maedhros, who killed himself at the very end of the First Age, and Maglor, who survived only to wander despondently alone along the shores of Middle-earth, and – in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; – Amras, who perished at [[Losgar]] by a terrible accident.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;...In the morning [after the burning of the ships] the host was mustered, but of Fëanor’s seven sons only six were to be found. Then Ambarussa went pale with fear. ‘Did you not then rouse Ambarussa my brother (whom you called Ambarto)?’ he said. ‘He would not come ashore to sleep (he said) in discomfort.’ But it is thought (and no doubt Fëanor guessed this also) that it was in the mind of Ambarto to sail his ship back [afterwards] and rejoin [[Nerdanel]]; for he had been much [shocked] by the deed of his father.&amp;quot; ({{ME-ref|12|&amp;quot;The Shibboleth of Fëanor&amp;quot;}}).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Silmarillion]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, though, Amras is killed along with Amrod when they, along with Maedhros and Maglor, attack the refugee camp near the [[Mouths of Sirion]].
{{Fëanor}}
Fëanor&amp;apos;s only grandson, [[Celebrimbor]], played a role in creating the [[Rings of Power]].  He refused to collaborate with [[Sauron]], Morgoth&amp;apos;s servant, in making the [[Three Rings]], which were the greatest Rings except for Sauron&amp;apos;s [[One Ring|One]] and which Celebrimbor forged alone in secret.  But the Three were nonetheless subject to the authority of the One, which Sauron in his turn had forged alone in secret.
