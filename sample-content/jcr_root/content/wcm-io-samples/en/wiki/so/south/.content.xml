&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;South&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[noun]], [[adjective]], or [[adverb]] indicating [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] or [[geography]].

South is one of the four [[cardinal directions]] or [[compass]] points. It is the polar opposite of [[north]] and is [[perpendicular]] to [[east]] and [[west]].

By [[Norm (sociology)|convention]], the bottom side of a [[map]] is south.

To go south using a compass for [[navigation]], set a [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] or [[azimuth]] of 180°.

==South Pole==
True south is the direction towards the southern end of the axis about which the [[earth]] rotates, called the [[South Pole]]. The South Pole is located in [[Antarctica]]. [[Magnetic south]] is the direction towards the south [[Earth&amp;apos;s magnetic field|magnetic pole]], some distance away from the south geographic pole.

==Etymology==
The word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;south&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is derived from the name of one of the four dwarves in [[Norse mythology]], [[Norðri, Suðri, Austri and Vestri]], who each represented one of the directions of the world. The [[etymology]] of South can be traced back to the [[Old English language|Old English]] word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;suth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, related to the [[Old High German]] word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;sund&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and perhaps &amp;apos;&amp;apos;sunne&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in Old English with sense of &amp;quot;the region of the sun.&amp;quot;
