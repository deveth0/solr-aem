The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;movement&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of 19th century &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Maharashtra]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a mixed result of indigenous traditions and Western education.  The impact of Western education was evident on the educated people of [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and [[Poona|Pune]].  The mass movement was carried by other leaders inspired by traditions of saints like [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Eknath]], [[Chakradhar Swami|Chakradhar]], [[Tukaram]], etc., and kings like [[Shivaji]].

In 19th century Maharashtra, reformists tried to examine critically their social system and religious beliefs and gave priority to social reform as against political freedom. In their reform efforts, they had to contend with stiff opposition from the conservatives. Foremost among the reformists were [[Acharya Balshastri Jambhekar]] (1810&amp;amp;ndash;1846), who condemned the evil customs of [[Sati (practice)|sati]] and [[female infanticide]], [[Gopal Hari Deshmukh]] (1823&amp;amp;ndash;1892) who, through his shatpatre (a bunch of letters numbering 100 - exact no. is 108) attacked orthodox [[Brahmin|Brahmans]] opposing social and religious reforms and [[Jotirao Govindrao Phule]] (1827&amp;amp;ndash;1890) who revolted against the unjust [[caste system]], and upheld the cause of untouchables and education of women of lower castes.

[[Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar]] (1837&amp;amp;ndash;1925) and [[Mahadev Govind Ranade|Justice Ranade]] (1842&amp;amp;ndash;1901) were the pioneers of [[Prarthana Samaj]], an organisation for general, social and religious reform.  [[Gopal Ganesh Agarkar]] (1856&amp;amp;ndash;1895) gave priority to social reform.  [[Dhondo Keshav Karve]] (1858&amp;amp;ndash;1962) devoted his life to the cause of women&amp;apos;s education.  [[Behramji Malbari]] (1853&amp;amp;ndash;1912), a [[Parsi people|Parsi]] of [[Bombay]], started Seva Sadan for the care of women of all castes.

and so a person named sati came into well being.[[Pandita Ramabai]] (1858&amp;amp;ndash;1922) founded the [[Sharada Sadan]] in 1890 to help upper-class widows.  [[Jyotirao Phule|Mahatma Jyotirao Phule]] established [[Satyashodhak Samaj]], [[Vitthal Ramji Shinde]] (1873&amp;amp;ndash;1944), fought for the eradication of [[untouchability]] through his [[Depressed Classes Mission]].  [[Shahu Maharaj|Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj]] of [[Kolhapur]] (1874&amp;amp;ndash;1922) also plunged into this movement and defied the caste system, championed the cause of the untouchables and promoted education in his state.  [[Bhaurao Patil|Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil]] (1887&amp;amp;ndash;1959), the architect of the [[Rayat Shikshan Sanstha]], followed in the footprints of Phule, Shinde and Shahu Maharaj.

Maharashtra will always remain proud of [[Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar|Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar]] (1891&amp;amp;ndash;1956), the chief architect of the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]] and the creator of a social and political awareness among the [[Scheduled Castes of India]].

The social reform measures brought about a renaissance and social-awakening in Maharashtra. The efforts of DK Karve to improve women&amp;apos;s education, of Bhaurao Patil, [[Babasaheb Ambedkar|Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar]], [[Panjabrao Deshmukh|Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh]] and  Dr. Abasaheb Gopalrao Khedkar who championed the downtrodden people, as well as those of [[Tarabai Modak]] in [[Vidarbha]] and [[Anutai Wagh]] in the [[Adivasi]] areas, have set an example for other [[States of India|states]]. Services rendered to victims of leprosy by [[Shivaji Patwardhan|Dr Shivaji Patwardhan]] and [[Baba Amte]] are unparalleled. [[Vijay Merchant]] fought relentlessly for facilities for the physically handicapped. [[Vinoba Bhave]], the spiritual heir of [[Gandhi]], sacrificed his life for [[sarvodaya]]. DK Karve started the Samata Sangh and he also started the monthly Manavisamata Sangh. DK Karve started a university in 1916 at Pune for women.In 1920 his university got a windfall in the form of 15 lakhs rupees as a donation by Sir Vitthaldas Thackersey and the name of the university was to kept on his mother&amp;apos;s name i.e. SMT.Nathibai Damodar Thackersey which is popularly known as (S.N.D.T.University)

Thus, the works of the saint-poets, social reformers and social constructive workers have made Maharashtra a progressive state.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
