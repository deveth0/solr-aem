The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;South London Theatre&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Community theatre]] in [[West Norwood]] in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]], [[England]].  The first play opened in October 1967, and it is now a busy [[theatre|theatrical]] venue, presenting more than 22 shows annually in two [[auditoria]]: the 100-seater [[proscenium arch]] &amp;quot;Bell Theatre&amp;quot; and a smaller &amp;quot;[[Black box theater|black box theatre]]&amp;quot; called &amp;quot;[[Prompt Corner]]&amp;quot;, it also has a private [[basement]] bar open 363 nights a year which is host to regular social events.

The plays produced include all genres: Shakespeare, comedy, classics, pantomime, musicals and modern cutting-edge drama. New writing is particularly encouraged, as are aspiring directors. There are plenty of available roles behind scenes and help and encouragement is given to new members.

There is a very active youth group&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.nayt.org.uk/youngpeople/youth-theatres/theatres/greater-london/lambeth/south-london-theatre&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; (known as the &amp;quot;South London Youth Theatre&amp;quot;) as well as children&amp;apos;s classes. The children have their own showcases and are also encouraged to participate in the main productions.

The South London Theatre is a member of the [[Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain]] &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.littletheatreguild.org//cgi-bin/PHPTest/LTGTheatreShow.php?theatreid=20 Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;..

==Building==

The [[Gothic revival]] style building was originally a [[fire station]], built in 1881. It retains much of that original character, for example it is the only fire Station for horse-drawn tenders which still has the look-out tower and doors still in place. The building should always retain its historic features as the frontage of the building is Grade II [[listed building|listed]]. It had a short history as a fire station as it was built for horse-drawn fire engines and the new motorised appliances were too big for the doors, which could not be extended. The area behind these doors, where the appliances and horses were kept, is now the Bell [[Theatre]] stage. Between its life as a fire station and its current one as a theatre, the building was used as a hall for the local church and also as an illegal boxing venue.

The design for the conversion to a theatre was by [[Owen Luder]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/3300-south-london-theatre&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; (later to become President of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] on two occasions and a well-known [[Dulwich]] personality), the original design for the building was probably designed by Richard Pearsall, in the Metropolitan Board of Works Architect&amp;apos;s Department.

Like all old buildings, the theatre requires a lot of maintenance and a renovation is planned which should make the building fully [[Handicapped-accessible|accessible]] and able to accept performances from external theatre companies.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://southlondontheatre.co.uk/restoration/ Case for restoration funding]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

For those interested at simply looking around the building, it does tours for a weekend in September as part of [[Open House London]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.londonopenhouse.org/public/london/event.html]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
