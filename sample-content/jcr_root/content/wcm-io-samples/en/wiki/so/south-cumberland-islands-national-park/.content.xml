&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;South Cumberland Islands&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a national park in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], 831&amp;amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Brisbane]]. [[Marine stinger]]s are found in the waters of the park between October and May.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;xqnp&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Islands==
Islands that are protected within the park include [[Keswick Island]], St Bees Island, Cockermouth Island and [[Scawfell Island]], which is the largest in the group. Refuge Bay on Scawfell Island provides good anchorage and fishing is permitted here.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;xqnp&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=Explore Queensland&amp;apos;s National Parks |year=2008 |publisher=Explore Australia Publishing |location=Prahran, Victoria |isbn=978-1-74117-245-4 |pages=17 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Bush camping is permitted on Scawfell Island but visitors must be self-sufficient.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Scawfell Island&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Scawfell Island (located at 20°52&amp;apos;S., 149°37&amp;apos;E.) rises to a peak, 397m high, South East of Duddon Point, the North extremity of the island. The Island lies off the cost of [[Queensland]] [[Australia]], North East of Mackay. The island, lying 60 kilometres off the Australian mainland, is a large horseshoe shape. Granite cliffs line the coast of Scawfell Island, the largest national park island in the South Cumberland group. Large areas of rainforest perch on steep mountain slopes. Access to the island is via Refuge bay, a tree lined 1.3 km white sandy beach. The bay is a wide sheltered bay facing north with all tidal access. The bay has clear blue water, an excellent coral fringing reef, ideal for snorkelling.

The island is officially regarded as the beginning of the [[Whitsunday Islands|Whitsunday group]]. It was originally part of the Cumberland Isles Group identified by Captain James Cook in 1770, but was not named.  The island is one of the Cumberland Isles, later know as Whitsundays, and is now part of the South Cumberland Islands. Designated L Island by Lieutenant [[Matthew Flinders]] of the British  Royal Navy in September 1802 as one of his numerous alpha-numeric designations along the Queensland coast during his circumnavigation of Australia in HMS Investigator in 1802/3. Named as Scawfell Island in 1879 by Staff Commander [[E. P. Bedwell]] of the British Royal Navy  who surveyed and named many islands of the Whitsundays in 1879 in SS Llewellyn. The Island is named after a mountain in Cumbria, England. This mountain is now called [[Sca Fell]], and is part of the [[Scafell Pike]] range.

The island is uninhabited, though camping is allowed, but a permit is required from Queensland National parks. Camping is at sheltered sites in Refuge Bay.
