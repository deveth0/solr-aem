        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sohonet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[community-of-interest network]] for the television, film and media production community.

Founded in 1995 by a group of [[Soho]]-based [[post-production]] companies, Sohonet links many of the British [[film studio]]s to London&amp;apos;s [[post-production]] community. Sohonet also provides access to the [[Internet]], and private wide-area links to other countries.

Sohonet has a global media network with private connectivity to the [[United States]], ([[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[New York]], etc.), [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[France]], [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] ( [[Rome]]) and the ability to provide connectivity to locations worldwide via [[fiber]] and [[satellite]] links.

The leading British film studios, [[Pinewood Studios]], [[Shepperton Studios]], [[Three Mills Studios]], [[Twickenham Film Studios]] and [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden]], have direct [[optical fiber]] connectivity to the Sohonet [[London]] Fiber Ring, with campus connectivity on the sites provided via [[fiber]] and [[VDSL]] technologies. As well as may other studios globally, Australian examples [[Village Roadshow Studios]], [[Melbourne_Central_City_Studios#Melbourne_Central_City_Studios|Melbourne City Studios]], and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] shooting film studios [[Hollywood Center Studios]], and [[Red Studios]], as well as [[Warner Bros.]], [[Universal Studios]], [[HBO]] to name a few.

Sohonet is the winner of numerous industry awards, and was a pioneering user of IP-over-[[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] networking. Sohonet has since moved away from ATM to using [[Gigabit Ethernet]], [[10 Gigabit Ethernet]] and [[Multiprotocol Label Switching|MPLS]] technologies, including the use of [[wavelength division multiplexing]] on backbone connections. It has its own private optical fibre networks in several cities.

Today Sohonet is one of the pioneers of tapeless [[Digital intermediate]], and one of the instigators of the [[Pro-MPEG]] [[media dispatch protocol]], now a [[SMPTE]] standard.

All types of [[list of file formats|media file formats]], from [[QuickTime]] [[DV]] [[MPEG]] [[AES/EBU]] [[MXF]] through [[Serial Digital Interface]], [[OMFi]], [[Advanced Authoring Format|AAF]], [[OpenEXR]], to 4k [[DPX]] files are supported.
