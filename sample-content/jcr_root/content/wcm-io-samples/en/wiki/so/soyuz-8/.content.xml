&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Soyuz 8&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Союз 8&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Union 8&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was part of a joint mission with [[Soyuz 6]] and [[Soyuz 7]] that saw three [[Soyuz spacecraft]] in orbit together at the same time, carrying seven [[astronaut|cosmonaut]]s.

The crew consisted of commander [[Vladimir Shatalov]] and flight-engineer [[Aleksei Yeliseyev]], whose mission was to dock with Soyuz 7 and transfer crew, as the [[Soyuz 4]] (involving, among others, these two cosmonauts) and [[Soyuz 5]] missions did. Soyuz 6 was to film the operation from nearby.

However, this objective was not achieved due to equipment failures. Soviet sources were later to claim that no docking had been intended, but this seems unlikely, given the docking adapters carried by the spacecraft, and the fact that both Shatalov and Yeliseyev were veterans of the previous successful docking mission. This was the last time that the Soviet crewed Moon landing hardware was tested in orbit, and the failure seems to have been one of the final nails in the coffin of the programme.

The radio call sign of the spacecraft was {{lang|ru-Latn|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Granit&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}, meaning &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Granite&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This word is apparently used as the name of a reactive or defensive squadron in Soviet military training, and, just like the [[Soyuz 5]], it was constructed and its crew was trained to be the responsive (not entirely passive) or female spacecraft in its docking. Giving military names to the spacecraft was probably a response to an appeal that the commander of the Soyuz 5 made. Further, the word was probably chosen as it begins with a letter following that sequence  starting with {{lang|ru-Latn|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Antey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}} (meaning &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Antaeus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and {{lang|ru-Latn|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Buran&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}} (meaning &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Blizzard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;); &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Г&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (G) is the fourth letter of the Russian alphabet.
