        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sosumi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of the system sounds introduced in [[Apple Inc.]]&amp;apos;s [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] [[System 7 (Macintosh)|System 7]] [[operating system]] in 1991, an extremely short [[Sampling (music)|sample]] of a [[xylophone]], which gained notoriety in computer folklore as a cheeky response to a long-running &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Apple Corps v. Apple Computer]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; trademark conflict. The sound has been included in all subsequent versions of Mac OS, including [[Mac OS X]].

During the development of [[System 7 (Macintosh)|System 7]], the two Apples concluded a settlement agreement from an earlier dispute when Apple added a sound synthesis chip to its [[Apple IIGS|IIgs]] machine. As a result, Apple Computer was prohibited from using their trademark on &amp;quot;creative works whose principal content is music&amp;quot;.

When new sounds for System 7 were created, the sounds were reviewed by Apple&amp;apos;s legal department who objected that the new sound alert &amp;quot;chime&amp;quot; had a name that was &amp;quot;too musical&amp;quot;, under the [[Apple Corps v. Apple Computer|recent settlement]]. The creator of the new sound alerts for System 7, [[Jim Reekes]], had grown frustrated with the legal scrutiny and first [[quip]]ped it should be named &amp;quot;Let It Beep&amp;quot;, a pun on The Beatles&amp;apos; &amp;quot;[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]&amp;quot;. When someone remarked that that would not pass legal&amp;apos;s approval, he remarked &amp;quot;so sue me&amp;quot;. After a brief reflection, he resubmitted the sound&amp;apos;s name as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;sosumi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (a [[homophone]] of &amp;quot;so sue me&amp;quot;), telling the legal department that the name was [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and had nothing to do with music.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://vimeo.com/9370716 Jim Reekes describing the origins of the sosumi name (Vimeo)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sosumi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; exists as an [[inside joke]]{{fact|date=September 2012}} on Apple Inc.&amp;apos;s website as the name of a [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] [[typography|typographical]] style used for legal notices such as the copyright notice:

  &amp;amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;sosumi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
