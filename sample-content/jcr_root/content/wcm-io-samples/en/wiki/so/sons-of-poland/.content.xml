        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sons of Poland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  is a Polish-American [[Benefit society|fraternal benefit society]] which was organized in 1903. In addition to selling [[life insurance]] to members, it supports charities in the [[United States]] and [[Poland]] as well as activities in the [[Polish-American]] community in [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]].

==History==
{{unreferenced-section|date=March 2011}}
The association was incorporated in 1903. At the onset of its existence the association&amp;apos;s goals were to provide benefits for Polish-American families and to send financial help to their families in Poland. During the First World War, the delegates of the quadrennial convention of the association voted to tax each member 2 cents each month to be sent to feed hungry war victims in Poland. In the 1930s, large sums of money were sent to assist the poor in Polish cities. Just prior to World War II, the association was recognized for being the most active organization in the [[Polish-American]] community and was decorated with the [[Gold Cross of Merit]].
