While less convenient than compression joints and less reliable than flux solder joints, they are useful when fitting in confined spaces and where single handed fitting is required.

==Operation==
To obtain perfect joins, the inside of the fitting and the outside of the copper pipe are cleaned using coarse [[steel wool]], [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] paste is applied, the pipe is inserted into the fitting and heat applied from a portable [[propane]] torch until a ring of solder shows at the edges of the fitting.  To obtain a durable joint, water must not be poured on the solder joint to cool it.  Yorkshire fittings are now made with [[lead]]-free solder.

The fittings come in a great variety of configurations, such as Tee-pieces, straight couplers, elbows or bends, reducers (to join pipes of different diameters), stop-ends, and there are versions with screw threads (male or female) at one end to fit taps and galvanized iron pipes.
