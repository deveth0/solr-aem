Some of the buildings on De Uithof have an unusual architecture. The [[Educatorium| Educatorium Building]], which was designed by [[Rem Koolhaas]], contains a glass-bottomed walking bridge and circular walls. The [[Minnaert building]] contains a large basin that was used to collect rain water, but is being remodeled to house more classrooms. The wall of the canteen is supported by the characters &amp;apos;M&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;I&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;N&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;N&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;A&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;E&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;R&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;T&amp;apos;.
