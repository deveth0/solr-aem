&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zapiekanka&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (derived from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zapiekać&amp;apos;&amp;apos; – &amp;quot;to scorch&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;to roast&amp;quot;) is a [[Poland|Polish]] halved [[baguette]] or bread topped mainly with [[mushrooms]] and [[cheese]], also [[ham]] or other types of meat, and vegetables. Beside some basic versions there are several recipes like: &amp;quot;zapiekanka na ostro&amp;quot; (spicy Zapiekanka) and &amp;quot;zapiekanka z mięsem&amp;quot; (Zapiekanka with meat). They are usually placed in an oven until the cheese melts and the [[baguette]] or bread is crispy. It is served scalloped and usually topped with dressings like [[ketchup]] and chives. It’s a very popular fast food in Poland. Sidewalk sale prices range between 3 and 7 [[Polish złoty|zł]] for an approx. 25–50&amp;amp;nbsp;cm long Zapiekanka.

A very popular type of Zapiekanka is a &amp;quot;student&amp;apos;s Zapiekanka&amp;quot;, sometimes also called &amp;quot;whatever Zapiekanka&amp;quot;. It is made of whatever is at home at the moment, and the only compulsory ingredients are bread and cheese. It&amp;apos;s very commonly served (as an alternative to sandwiches) to unexpected guests if the host has nothing else to serve. It&amp;apos;s also a quick dish for students, sometimes taking even less time to make than an instant soup. As it can be stored in the fridge before baking, many students prepare a full plate of them at the weekend so that they have something quick and nutritious to eat for the whole week.
