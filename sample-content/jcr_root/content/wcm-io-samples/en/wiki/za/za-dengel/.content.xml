&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Za Dengel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Emperor of Ethiopia|{{unicode|negusä nägäst}}]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (throne name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Asnaf Sagad II&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or As.naf Seged or Atsnaf Seged, [[Ge&amp;apos;ez alphabet|Ge&amp;apos;ez]] አፅናፍ ሰገድ, &amp;quot;to whom the peaks bow&amp;quot;; 1603–1604) of [[Ethiopia]], and a member of the [[Solomonic dynasty]]. He was the son of Lesana Krestos, the brother of [[Sarsa Dengel]].

Za Dengel may have been married to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Woizero&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Wangelawit, eldest daughter of his second cousin [[Susenyos I|Susenyos]] (later emperor) and lady Wolde Saala of Walaqa and Marabete (later Empress Sultan Mogassa).

Sarsa Dengel had intended to make his nephew as his heir, recognizing that to avert the civil war that would likely follow his death an adult would be needed, and the emperor&amp;apos;s own sons were quite young. These plans were changed primarily through the influence of Empress Sena Maryam, stepmother of Emperor&amp;apos;s eldest surviving son Prince [[Yaqob]], who was made emperor in 1597. The empress had Za Dengel seized and confined in a religious retreat on the island of [[Dek Island|Dek]] in [[Lake Tana]]. Za Dengel eventually managed to escape, taking refuge in [[Gojjam]].

In 1603 Za Dengel was made Emperor by [[Ras (title)|Ras]] [[Za Sellase]], who intended Za Dengel to be little more than a figurehead. He was crowned as Asnaf Segad (&amp;apos;He to whom the horizons bow&amp;apos;). However, Za Dengel summoned the [[Jesuit]] [[Pedro Páez]] to his court at [[Dankaz]], who persuaded him to embrace [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]].

This religious conversion led to Za Sellase not only withdrawing his support, but actively working against him and stirred up a revolt in Gojjam. Za Dengel marched to the plain of [[Bartcho]] to put down this revolt, but despite the help of 200 [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[musketeer]]s Za Dengel perished in battle on &amp;lt;!-- 16 Tekemt --&amp;gt;October 24. According to [[James Bruce]], Za Dengel&amp;apos;s corpse lay unclaimed on the battlefield for three days, until some peasants buried it &amp;quot;in a little building, like a chapel (which I have seen), not above six feet high, under the shade of a very fine tree, in Abyssinia called sassa.&amp;quot; The body was reinterred 10 years later in [[Daga Estifanos]] monastery on [[Daga Island]] in Lake Tana.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;James Bruce, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1805 edition), vol. 3, pp. 270f&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
