&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zaptié&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the designation given to locally raised [[gendarmerie]] units in the Italian colonies of [[Tripolitania]], [[Cyrenaica]], [[Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]] between 1889 and 1942.

The word &amp;quot;zaptié&amp;quot; was derived from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zapiteh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was used to refer to the Turkish members recruited for the [[Cyprus Military Police]] during the period of British rule on the island.

The Italian colonial governments in the territories listed above modelled the various zaptié [[constabulary]] forces on [[Italy]]&amp;apos;s own &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[carabinieri]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The first of these units was raised in Eritrea in 1882, drawing from existing companies of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bashi-bazouk|basci bazuks]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Irregular military|irregular]] troops).

Zaptié troopers were armed with 1874 model [[revolver]]s, [[cavalry]] [[carbine]]s, and 1871 model [[sabre]]s. Officers and some non-commissioned officers were Italian, but the rank and file were recruited from the colony in question. As an example, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Somali Zaptié Corps&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1927 numbered 1,500 [[Somali people|Somali]] and 72 [[Italian people|Italian]] personnel. Uniforms varied from colony to colony, but usually comprised [[Fez (hat)|fez]]s, red [[sash]]es and [[khaki]] or white clothing. A common feature was the white and red collar [[insignia]] of the carabinieri.

In Italian Somaliland, the zaptié provided a ceremonial escort for the Italian [[Viceroy]] (Governor) as well as the territorial police: there were nearly one thousand of them in 1922, when [[Benito Mussolini]] took control of the Italian government and started a policy of &amp;quot;pacification&amp;quot; and assimilation of the Italian colonies.

Three hundred zaptié took part in the Italian conquest of northern Somalia in 1925. As part of the &amp;quot;colonna Musso&amp;quot;, they assisted in the occupation of the [[Sultanate of Obbia]] (Hafun and Ordio). Other zaptìé units served with the &amp;quot;colonna Bergesio&amp;quot; in the Elemari region (Gallacaio, Garad and Sinedogò). In 1926 zaptìé served in the [[Majeerteen#The_Majeerteen_Sultanates|Majeerteen Sultanate]] (Bender Ziada, Candala and Bender Cassim).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.mudugonline.com/MajertainSaltanates/Sultanate.htm Italian conquest of north-eastern Somalia]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Zaptìé detachments participated in the [[Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian conquest of Ethiopia]] in 1936 and in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] of [[World War II]].

In 1941 in Somalia and Ethiopia 2,186 zaptìé (plus 500 recruits under training) formed part of the [[Carabinieri]]. They were organised in a battalion commanded by Major Alfredo Serranti that defended [[:it:Battaglia di Culqualber|Culqualber]] (Ethiopia) for three months until this military unit was destroyed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. After heavy fighting the Italian Carabinieri received &amp;quot;full military honors&amp;quot; from the British.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Arma/Curiosita/Non+tutti+sanno+che/Z/2+Z.htm &amp;quot;Non tutti sanno che... Zaptié&amp;quot; (in Italian)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In this battle, Muntaz (corporal) Unatù Endisciau of the LXXII Zaptié (I° Gruppo [[Carabinieri]]) Battalion was the only &amp;quot;soldier of colour&amp;quot; to be awarded the Italian [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Editoria/Carabiniere/2004/01-Gennaio/Militaria/   Article of Arnaldo Grilli on the first two years of World War II (in Italian)].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

After [[World War II]] a former member of the zaptìé corps, [[Siad Barre]], became President of Somalia from 1969 to 1991&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.libri.de/shop/action/productDetails/12704374/praesident_somalia_1159277117.html President Siad Barre life (German)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
