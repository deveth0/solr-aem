&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zacatepec de Hidalgo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Zacatepec from nahuatl Zacatl meaning grass and tepetl meaning hill, thus loosely meaning &amp;quot;grassy hill&amp;quot;) is a town in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Morelos]]. It stands at {{coord|18|41|N|99|11|W|}}. Bordered by Puente de Ixtla, Tlaltizapan,Tlaquiltenango and Jojutla.

The town serves as the municipal seat for the municipality, with which it shares the name.
The municipality reported 33,331 inhabitants in the year 2000 census.

The main industry in the town and its surrounding countryside is that of sugar cane cultivation and processing. The most noticeable feature of the town is the sugar mill located in its centre and during operating hours the air of the settlement is laden with the sickly-sweet smell of sugar.

Students come from surrounding parts of Morelos to study at the public university, the Instituto Tecnológico de Zacatepc, which is located on a site adjacent to the sugar mill.

==History==

In precolumbian times Zacatepec was under the Tlahuica lordship of Cuauhnahuac(Cuernavaca). After the conquest it fell under the jurisdiction of the Count of Oaxaca. Once the independence of Mexico was won Zacatepec was part of the State of Mexico, until the creation of the State of Morelos.

==Sports==

Zacatepec de Hidalgo has a soccer team, named [[Zacatepec]], nicknamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cañeros&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Sugarcane growers). Their colors are white and green. Their uniform color is a white shirt with a big green line in the middle and white shorts and socks. Their greatest achievements were in the 1950s when Club Zacatepec won two titles in [[Primera División de México|First Division]]. They won their first league title in the 1954–1955 season and their second in the 1957–1958 season. They were runner-ups in the 1952–1953 season when they lost the league championship to Tampico. Zacatepec won the [[Copa Mexico|Mexican Cup]] in the 1958–1959 season.

The head coach of Zacatepec during the 1950s was the Mexican coach Ignacio Trelles, who later became head coach of the Mexican National Team in the [[1962 FIFA World Cup]] in Chile and [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] in [[England]].

Nowadays the team plays in [[Tercera División de México|Third Division]].

[[Estadio Coruco Díaz|Agustin &amp;quot;Coruco&amp;quot; Diaz]] stadium is the home of Zacatepec. It was founded in November 1954. It was inaugurated by then president of Mexico [[Adolfo López Mateos]]. The stadium is nicknamed la selva cañera (the sugarcane jungle), due to Zacatepec&amp;apos;s humid weather conditions.

Zacatepec&amp;apos;s motto is “Hacer Deporte es Hacer Patria” which means doing sports is to be a patriot.
