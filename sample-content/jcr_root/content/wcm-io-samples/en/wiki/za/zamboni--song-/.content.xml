&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zamboni&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; is a song written by Martin Zellar and recorded by his band [[Gear Daddies]]. The song tells the story of a man&amp;apos;s desire to drive an [[ice resurfacer]], popularly known by the brand name &amp;quot;Zamboni&amp;quot;, and his request to drive the Zamboni for his local [[ice hockey]] team. Since its release, it has sometimes been played between periods at hockey games while the [[Ice resurfacer|Zamboni]] cleans the ice.

It originally appeared as a [[hidden track]] on the band&amp;apos;s 1990 CD, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Billy&amp;apos;s Live Bait]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The song also appeared on the [[soundtrack]]s for the following [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] movies:
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[D2: The Mighty Ducks]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1994) &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Sound Track at Amazon listed as &amp;quot;8.

* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Mystery, Alaska]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1999) &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;IMDB sound track listed 4th as &amp;quot;(I Wanna Drive the) Zamboni&amp;quot; [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134618/soundtrack Soundtracks for Mystery, Alaska (1999)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
