&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zaretan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zarethan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zeredathah&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a city mentioned in the [[Bible]], as near the location where the [[Hebrews]] crossed the [[Jordan River|Jordan]].  In the books of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Joshua&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;2 Kings&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, it is called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zarethan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;2 Chronicles&amp;apos;&amp;apos; it is called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zeredathah&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Zaredathah stood in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], on the east bank of the river, a few kilometres northwest of [[Sukkot (place)|Succoth]] and approximately 70 kilometres north-northeast of [[Jerusalem]].  These clay grounds were where the bronze castings for the [[Solomon&amp;apos;s Temple|Temple]] of [[Solomon]] were made by [[Hiram I]].

As soon as the feet of the priests were dipped in the water, the flow of the stream was arrested. The point of arrest was the &amp;quot;[[city of Adam]] beside Zaretan,&amp;quot; probably near [[Sukkot|Succoth]], at the mouth of the [[Jabbok]],
some 30 miles up the river from where the people were encamped.
Apparently the water &amp;quot;stood and rose upon an heap.&amp;quot; Thus the whole
length of 30 miles of the riverbed was dry, so that the tribes
might pass over (Joshua 3:16, 17; compare Psalms 104:3).
