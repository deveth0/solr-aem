&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zavitinsk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an air base in [[Amur Oblast]], [[Russia]] located 9&amp;amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Zavitinsk]].  It was a major nuclear bomber base of the [[Long Range Aviation]] (a sister of [[Ukrainka]]).  A revetment area exists on the far side of runway with 18 large stands.

It began operating the [[Tupolev Tu-16]] aircraft late in the 1960s, serving a close/medium range facility as opposed to its long-range sister base Ukrainka.

Units stationed at Zavitinsk included:
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;303 TBAP&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (303rd Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment) flying [[Tupolev Tu-16|Tu-16s]] beginning in 1955 and upgrading to [[Tupolev Tu-16#Variants|Tu-16Ks]] in 1972, and [[Tupolev Tu-22|Tu-22Ks]] around the 1980s.&amp;lt;ref name=DA&amp;gt;{{cite web| title = Dal&amp;apos;nyaya Aviatsiya | publisher = Aviabaza KPOI | url = http://airbase.ru/squad/russia/da/ }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The 303rd was formed 1941 as the 303rd Long-Range Bomber Aviation Regiment. In 1946 it was renamed the 303rd Bomber Aviation Regiment, and in 1951 renamed 303rd Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment. Disbanded 1994.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Holm, http://www.ww2.dk/new/air%20force/regiment/bap/303tbap.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
