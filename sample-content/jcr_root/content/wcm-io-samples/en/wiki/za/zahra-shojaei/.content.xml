        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zahra Shojaei&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an Iranian politician. An outspoken advocate of women&amp;apos;s rights, she was advisor on women&amp;apos;s affairs under President [[Khatami]], and as such a member of his cabinet from 1997-2005.

==Center for Women&amp;apos;s Participation==
In 1997, Khatami created the [[Center for Women&amp;apos;s Participation]], which then became the main institution responsible for handling women&amp;apos;s affairs in the country, affiliated with the presidency. When Ahmadinejad took the presidency in 2005, he renamed it [[Center for Women and Family Affairs]] (Markaz-e Omor-e Zanan va Khanevadeh Riasat-e Jomhuri).

==Appointment to Iranian Cabinet==
President Khatami appointed Zahra Shojaei as his advisor on women&amp;apos;s affairs (a position formerly held by [[Shahla Habibi]]) and the head of the [[Center for Women&amp;apos;s Participation]]. This appointment made her a member of the Iranian Presidential Cabinet.  Zahra Shojaei, along with [[Masoumeh Ebtekar]], participated in the first cabinet since the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] to include women.

==Transition==
With the election of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] 2005, [[Nasrin Soltankhah]] was appointed to Shojaei&amp;apos;s post. The center was renamed [[Center for Women and Family Affairs]], as opposed to [[Center for Women&amp;apos;s Participation]] as it was called under Khatami. Participation was no longer a policy emphasis.
