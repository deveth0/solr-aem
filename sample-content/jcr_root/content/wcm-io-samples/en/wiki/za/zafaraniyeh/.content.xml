&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zafaraniyeh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (main street: Shahid Sarlashkar Fallahi) is a neighbourhood in the north of [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]. The name&amp;apos;s origin lies in the fact that it was the residence of many [[saffron]] traders long ago, thus the name Zafaraniyeh (the Persian version of Saffronia). The [[Islamic Azad University]] of [[Tehran]], Languages branch is located at the beginning of Zafaraniyeh that teaches [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and other foreign languages. The museum of [[Sa&amp;apos;dabad Palace]] is situated at the end of this street, which also contains a [[culture]] house. There are plans to build a [[shopping center]] in Asef [[Junction (road)|crossroad]]. The Moghaddas Ardebili Street connects Zafaraniyeh to [[Velenjak]] from east and to [[Valiasr Street]] from west. Egypt&amp;apos;s embassadorial residence is also located there.  There is also a [[synagogue]] in this neighbourhood. Zafaraniyeh is classed as being one of the best areas of Tehran, with many rich Iranians and non-Iranians living here. The area has many millionaires and many of the residents also live abroad. The area consists of nearly all apartment blocks with only a few houses. It is near the longest city road in Asia called Vali-asr Street. This area of Vali-asr street has many foreign boutiques which is the only area in Iran that has shops such as Gucci, Rolex and Armani boutiques.
