        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zaban&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the [[Lombards|Lombard]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[dux]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or duke) of [[Pavia]] (Ticinum) during the decade-long interregnum known as the [[Rule of the Dukes]] (574 &amp;amp;ndash; 584). Pavia had been the capital of the Lombard kingdom, but after the death of King [[Cleph]], it became the centre of a great duchy, one of thirty five into which the Lombard state was then divided. It seems that, as the ruler of the ancient capital, Zaban held a certain superiority of rank over his fellow &amp;apos;&amp;apos;duces&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and may have acted as their commander-in-chief.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.fernweb.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/mf/lombards.htm The Conquest of Italy.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 574, Zaban invaded the lands of [[Guntram]], [[King of Burgundy]], in what is today [[Switzerland]], but was repulsed and had to return to Italy.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Hodgkin, V, p 219.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 575, Zaban and his fellow dukes [[Amo (duke)|Amo]] and [[Rodanus]] invaded the valleys of the [[Rhône River|Rhône]] and [[Saône]]. Amo passing by [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]] encamped near [[Manosque]], a city of [[Mummolus]], the Gallo-Roman general of Burgundy. Rodanus besieged [[Grenoble]] and Zaban passing down the valley of the [[Durance]] by [[Die, Drôme|Die]], laid siege to [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]]. Amo successfully subdued the regions of [[Arles]] and [[Marseilles]], while Mummolus rescued the city of Grenoble and sent Rodanus and his army of 500 to the protection of Zaban&amp;apos;s forces. The two then marched on Embrun, plundered it, and met an army of Mummolus&amp;apos;. Defeated, they retreated back to [[Susa]], in Italy, which was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] possession of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[magister militum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Sisinnius. Mummolus invaded Italy and forced Zaban and Rodanus to return to their own duchies, while Amo had to abandon his booty while crossing the [[Alps]]. Guntram&amp;apos;s kingdom was extended at the expense of the Lombard to include the cisalpine cities of [[Aosta]] and Susa. The Lombards hereafter ceased their Gaulish invasions.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Hodgkin, V, p 223.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
