There are texts dating back to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era that mention Pelion by the name Zagora. During the Byzantine Empire, Zagora, through its harbor, Chorefto, developed significant trading activity and was ruled as a [[Maritime Republics|Merchant Republic]], with direct ties to [[Venice]]. The mayor of Zagora is still called &amp;quot;the President&amp;quot;. Zagorian sailors, merchants, missionaries and explorers have travelled as far as China and South America. [[Marco Polo|Silk merchant]] Angelo di Stamo was one of the first people to meet Marquis de Parana, Prime Minister of the [[Brazilian Empire]]. In 1897 the author Yohannes Lazarres won [[gold medal|first price]] in Tsangarada book contest for his masterpiece &amp;quot;Eis meros skieron&amp;quot;.
