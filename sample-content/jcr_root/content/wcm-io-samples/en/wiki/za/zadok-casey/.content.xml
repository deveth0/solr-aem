&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zadok Casey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (March 7, 1796&amp;amp;nbsp;â€“ September 4, 1862) was an [[Politics of the United States|American politician]] who served as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Illinois]] from 1833 to 1843. He founded the city of [[Mount Vernon, Illinois|Mount Vernon]] around 1817. He was elected to the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] in 1822 and to the [[Illinois State Senate]] in 1826, and was elected the [[List of lieutenant governors of Illinois|fourth]] [[Lieutenant Governor of Illinois|Lieutenant Governor]] in 1830. He served in the [[Twenty-third United States Congress]] (1833) through the [[Twenty-seventh United States Congress]] (1843). He was a [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian Democrat]]. He again served in the Illinois House from 1848 to 1852, serving as speaker in 1852, and in the State Senate from 1860 to 1862.

Zadok Casey was born in [[Greene County, Georgia]]. Not much is known about his early life. One story is that, as a young man, he witnessed a murder. Because he did not wish to testify, he fled to the frontier. He died in [[Caseyville, Illinois]] at age 66, and was interred at Old Union Cemetery in Mount Vernon.

[[Casey Creek (Illinois)|Casey Creek]], a tributary of the [[Big Muddy River]], is named in honor of Zadok Casey. Casey Middle School and Casey Avenue in Mount Vernon are also named after him.
