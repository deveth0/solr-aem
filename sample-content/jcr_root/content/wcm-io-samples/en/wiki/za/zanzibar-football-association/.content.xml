The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zanzibar Football Association&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ZFA) ({{lang-sw|Chama cha Mpira wa Miguu Zanzibar}}) is the governing [[football (soccer)|football]] association for [[Zanzibar]], [[Africa]].

The ZFA are an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;associate member&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the African governing body, the [[Confederation of African Football]]. Following a rejection from FIFA in 2005,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/4330361.stm|title=FIFA turns Zanzibar down|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-01-19 | date=2005-03-08}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; the ZFA were removed from CAF and after much lobbying were reinstated as an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;associate member&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This meant that the club sides associated with the ZFA can participate in the continental club competitions organised by [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] but the [[Zanzibar national football team|Zanzibar national team]] could not. The ZFA are not entitled to vote in CAF affairs due to their associate member status.
Players from Zanzibar are eligible to play in international competition for the [[Tanzania national football team|Tanzania]] team, the representative of the sovereign territory.

As a nation state, it has competed in regional competitions since 1949. It currently competes in [[CECAFA]] organised tournaments.
