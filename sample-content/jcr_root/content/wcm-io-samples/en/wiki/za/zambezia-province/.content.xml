&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zambezia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the second most-populous province of [[Mozambique]], located in the central coastal region south-west of [[Nampula Province]] and north-east of [[Sofala Province]]. It has a population of 3,85 million (census 2007).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ine.gov.mz/Map.aspx |title=Estatísticas Regionais - População total - 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |work=[[Instituto Nacional de Estatística]] |date= }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The provincial capital is [[Quelimane]] on the [[Bons Sinais River]].

Zambezia has a total area of 103,127&amp;amp;nbsp;km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, much of it drained by the [[Zambezi River]]. Much of the coast consists of [[mangrove]] swamps, and there is considerable forest inland.

Agricultural products include [[rice]], [[maize]], [[cassava]], [[cashew]]s, [[sugarcane]], [[coconut]]s, [[citrus]], [[cotton]], and [[tea]]; the country&amp;apos;s largest tea estates are at [[Gurúè]]. [[Fishing]] is especially productive of [[shrimp]], and [[gemstone]]s are mined at several sites.

[[Vasco da Gama]] landed at the site of Quelimane in 1498. Shortly after, the Portuguese established a permanent presence, and many moved up the Zambezi into the interior, for many years the farthest inland European presence (although over time there was much intermarrying, and few residents were of purely Portuguese descent).

==Districts==
The sixteen districts of Zambezia Province comprise:
*[[Alto Molocue District]] - with an area of 6,386&amp;amp;nbsp;km² and 278,064 population,

== Stamps and postal history of Zambezia ==

[[Image:Stamp Zambezia 1903 25r.jpg|left|130px|thumb|25-reis value of the King Carlos issue of 1898, along with the hexagonal postmark typical of the Portuguese postal system.]]

Although Zambezia was a part of the [[Portuguese East Africa Colony]], the Portuguese government issued separate [[postage stamp]]s for it starting in 1894, with the standard design depicting King [[Charles of Portugal|Charles]], and likewise in 1898. A [[provisional issue]] came in 1902 to reflect changed rates, then after the revolution of 1910 there were several issues [[overprint]]ed &amp;quot;REPUBLICA&amp;quot;.

The postal districts of [[Quelimane]] and [[Tete]] were created from parts of Zambezia in about 1913, and then stamps of [[Mozambique]] replaced stamps of Zambezia around 1920.
