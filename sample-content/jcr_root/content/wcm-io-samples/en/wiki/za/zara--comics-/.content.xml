&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zara, Priestess of the Crimson Flame&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a villain who battled the Golden Age [[Wonder Woman]]. She was also a member of the super-villain team [[Villainy Inc.]] She first debuted in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Comic Cavalcade]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; #5.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
The true past of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zara&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is unknown, however she claimed to be &amp;quot;an [[Arab]] girl,&amp;quot; (although she had a French accent), and wore belly dancer attire. According to her tales, she was sold into slavery as a child; which created in her an intense hatred of mankind. Using a flair for [[pyrotechnic]]s, she eventually created a new religion (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Cult of The Crimson Flame&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), which had swept the globe. Zara rigged various fire-based effects to dazzle her followers and keep them in thrall to her. After her initial defeat by [[Wonder Woman]], the Cult went underground; and Zara was able to scare up at least one follower to do her bidding when she joined [[Villainy Inc.]]

The lovely red-haired high priestess of the mystic Cult of the Crimson Flame, a &amp;quot;new religion&amp;quot; that has begun &amp;quot;sweeping the world&amp;quot;. Its symbol is an eerie &amp;quot;crimson flame&amp;quot; that appears out of nowhere at the behest of the high priestess, hanging suspended in midair and inscribing mysterious flaming messages to cow the members of the cult - the so-called &amp;quot;flame slaves&amp;quot; - into abject obedience.

{{cquote|I am the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;crimson flame of life&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;quot; intones a grim voice from within the flame,&amp;quot;- I burn within the breasts of all who obey me!  Whosoever opposes me shall be &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;consumed&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;!}}

Anyone daring to oppose the cult falls mysteriously ill and dies soon afterward.

When Helen Armstrong, a U.S. Senator&amp;apos;s daughter who has been intimately involved with the flame cult, disappears mysteriously, Wonder Woman, [[Steve Trevor]], [[Etta Candy]], and the [[Holliday Girls]] follow her to Arabia, site of the Crystal Temple of the Crimson Flame, the &amp;quot;international headquarters&amp;quot; of Zara and her sinister &amp;quot;flame forces.&amp;quot;  Ultimately, Wonder Woman and her companions defeat the flame cultists, rescue Helene Armstrong from their clutches, and capture Zara.

{{cquote|I&amp;apos;m an Arab,&amp;quot; explains Zara, &amp;quot;-my father sold me as a slave!  Oh, how I hated heem!  I swore I&amp;apos;d get &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;revenge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on men of power!  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Revenge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - that ees my crimson flame!}}

It was to wreak vengeance on Helene&amp;apos;s father that Zara had had her abducted.

The much-feared &amp;quot;crimson flame,&amp;quot; confesses Zara, was actually nothing more than &amp;quot;floating, burning, liquid hydrogen,&amp;quot; while the voice seeming to speak from inside it was actually an illusion created with movie projector sound equipment.

{{cquote|To destroy enemies,&amp;quot; continues Zara, &amp;quot;I put &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ideas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in zair mind, zen zay make &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;zemselves&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sick, poor fools!}} &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Comics Cavalcade&amp;apos;&amp;apos; #5 (Winter 1943): &amp;quot;Mystery of the Crimson Flame&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Zara escapes from Transformation Island which works to rehabilitate female criminals along with seven other villainesses and joins them in forming Villainy Incorporated &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wonder Woman&amp;apos;&amp;apos; #28:  &amp;quot;Villainy Incorporated!&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Trap of Crimson Flame&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;In the Hands of the Merciless!&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

===Post-Crisis===
Post-Crisis, Zara has been depicted as an Arabian woman and her flame-powers were inborn rather than produced by gadgets (originally, she used a fire-gun). However, [[Queen Hippolyta (comics)|Hippolyta]] referred to her flames as &amp;apos;scientific trickery.&amp;apos; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wonder Woman: Our Worlds at War&amp;apos;&amp;apos; #1&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Recently, Zara has been mentioned as one of the inhabitants of [[Alan Scott]]&amp;apos;s Emerald City on the dark side of the moon.  She is mentioned as being a &amp;quot;fire girl&amp;quot; and an &amp;quot;old enemy of Wonder Woman.&amp;quot; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Justice Society of America&amp;apos;&amp;apos; #43 (November 2010)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Pre-Crisis, she used a fire-gun and rigged effects to appear to have a mastery over flames. Post-Crisis, her powers are internal, but may have been the result of scientific engineering rather than from natural sources (e.g., magic, meta-human, etc.).
