==Professional career==

In 1991, he returned to boxing and went on a nine fight winning streak, which included victories over future champion [[James Page (boxer)|James Page]] and former champion [[Roger Mayweather]], before challenging for a world title. In 1993, he captured the WBO Light Welterweight Title in an upset unanimous decision victory over undefeated [[Carlos González (boxer)|Carlos Gonzalez]]. Later that year, he was named the [[Ring magazine]] [[Ring Magazine comeback of the year|comeback fighter of the year]]. Padilla successfully defended his title four times with victories over Efrem Calamati (35-0-1), [[Ray Oliveira]], Harold Miller, and former champion [[Juan Laporte]]. His fight with Olivera in 1993 once held the [[Compubox]] record for the most punches thrown in a fight at 3,020.

==Retirement==
During a sparring session with [[Shane Mosley]], Padilla was hit with a hard punch which aggravated a head injury from his last fight. Padilla&amp;apos;s boxing license was then suspended indefinitely, and he never fought again. He had a career record of 24-1-1 with 14 KO&amp;apos;s.

On June 25, 2012, Padilla was inducted into the California Boxing Hall of Fame.  This is in addition to having a street in his hometown of Azusa named in his honor.
