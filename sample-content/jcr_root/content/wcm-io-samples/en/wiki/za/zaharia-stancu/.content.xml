&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zaharia Stancu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-ro|zahaˈri.a ˈstanku}}; October 7, 1902 &amp;amp;ndash; December 5, 1974) was a [[Romanian people|Romanian]] prose writer, novelist, poet, and philosopher.

Stancu was born in 1902 in [[Salcia, Teleorman|Salcia]], a village in [[Teleorman County]], [[Romania]]. After leaving school at the age of thirteen he worked at various jobs. In 1921, with the help of [[Gala Galaction]], he became a journalist. In 1933 he finished his studies in literature and philosophy at the [[University of Bucharest]].

His fist volume of poetry, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Poeme simple&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Simple Poems&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), appeared in 1927, receiving the Romanian Writers&amp;apos; Prize. During [[World War II]], he was imprisoned for his opposition to the [[Fascism|fascist]] government of [[Ion Antonescu]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;see [[Romania during World War II]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), and spent time in the [[Târgu Jiu]] [[Internment|internment camp]] for [[political prisoner]]s.

In 1946, he became a director of [[National Theatre Bucharest|Romania&amp;apos;s National Theater]]. After the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] was established, he was a member of the [[Romanian Academy]] and the President of the [[Writers Union of Romania|Writers&amp;apos; Union of Romania]] (1966&amp;amp;ndash;1974). He won the Romanian State Prize for Literature and, in 1971, he was awarded the [[Herder Prize]] by the [[Austria]]n government.

Between 1926 and 1944 Stancu published six volumes of poetry. In 1948 his first important novel, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Desculț&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Barefoot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), was published. It has been translated into thirty languages. Other important novels are &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Şatra&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Gypsy Tribe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jocul cu moartea&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Gamble with Death&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).
