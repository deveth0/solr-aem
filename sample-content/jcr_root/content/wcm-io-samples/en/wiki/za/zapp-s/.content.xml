&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zapp&amp;apos;s&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a brand of [[potato chip]] made in the [[United States]]. The chips are cooked and packaged in [[Gramercy, Louisiana]]. The chips are [[kettle]]-cooked in [[peanut oil]] (instead of [[vegetable oil]], which many other companies use). Zapp&amp;apos;s market themselves with their [[Cajun]] heritage,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Donald J. Boudreaux, [http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/columnists/boudreaux/s_314030.html &amp;quot;A chip off the energy industry block&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, March 17, 2005.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; using names such as &amp;quot;Spicy Cajun Crawtator&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Sour Cream and Creole Onion&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Cajun Dill Gator-tators&amp;quot;. Others, in addition to the &amp;quot;Regular Flavored&amp;quot; include &amp;quot;Hot N&amp;apos; Hotter Jalapeño&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Lisa Belkin, [http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/01/garden/at-the-nation-s-table-houston.html At the Nation&amp;apos;s Table: Houston&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[New York Times]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, June 1, 1988.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  and &amp;quot;Mesquite BBQ&amp;quot;.  They have also marketed numerous chips such as a limited edition [[Mardi Gras]] chip.

The company was founded by Ron Zappe, who graduated from [[Texas A&amp;amp;M University]] with a degree in industrial engineering and became a distributor of pumps and other oil-field equipment. His four companies went bankrupt during the [[1980s oil glut|1980s oil bust]] and he moved from Houston to Louisiana and started a potato chip business.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Mary Fonseca, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1154/is_n5_v78/ai_8980531/ &amp;quot;Cajun crunchies - Ron Zappe&amp;apos;s potato chip business&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nation&amp;apos;s Business&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, May 1990.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  (Zappe later received national attention for his [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]] campaign appearance on behalf of Republican vice presidential candidate [[Dan Quayle]], crediting a jobs program co-created by Quayle with enabling him to start his factory in Gramercy.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Bob Secter, [http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-01/news/mn-4585_1_dan-quayle &amp;quot;Strategists Craft Positive Image: Quayle Campaign Turns From Survival to Offense&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Los Angeles Times]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, September 1, 1988.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Michael Kranish, [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/59665289.html?dids=59665289:59665289&amp;amp;FMT=ABS&amp;amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;amp;type=current&amp;amp;date=Sep+11%2C+1988&amp;amp;author=Michael+Kranish%2C+Globe+Staff&amp;amp;pub=Boston+Globe+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;amp;desc=BELEAGUERED+JOB+PROGRAM+COULD+BE+THORN+IN+QUAYLE+CAMP&amp;amp;pqatl=google &amp;quot;Beleaguered Job Program Could Be Thorn In Quayle Camp&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Boston Globe]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, September 11, 1988 (pay site).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;)  Zappe&amp;apos;s first creation, the Cajun Crawtator, was introduced in 1985 as the nation&amp;apos;s first spicy Cajun chip. Zapp&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Tiger Tators&amp;quot; were the first food product licensed by [[Louisiana State University]], and it also sold &amp;quot;[[Who Dat?]]” chips in honor of the [[New Orleans Saints]].

In 2006 Zapp&amp;apos;s acquired the California Chip Company in Oxnard, CA which manufactures California Chips brand potato chips. Zappe appeared on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1997, and the chips were profiled in national publications such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[People (magazine)|People]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Wall Street Journal]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Zappe died in [[Houston, Texas]] on June 1, 2010 at the age of 67.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/95368104.html &amp;quot;Zapp&amp;apos;s Potato Chips founder dies&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Advocate]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Baton Rouge, La.), June 1, 2010.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Anna Brown, [http://www.wbrz.com/news/zapps-creator-owner-dies-at-age-67/ &amp;quot;Zapp&amp;apos;s creator, owner dies at age 67&amp;quot;], [[WBRZ-TV]], June 1, 2010.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  In January 2011, it was reported that the company would be sold to [[Utz Quality Foods]] of [[Hanover, Pennsylvania]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2011/01/zapps_being_sold_to_pennsylvan.html &amp;quot;Zapp&amp;apos;s of Gramercy being sold to Pennsylvania company&amp;quot;], [[Associated Press|AP]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Times-Picayune]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, January 7, 2011.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The sale to Utz was completed in April 2011.
