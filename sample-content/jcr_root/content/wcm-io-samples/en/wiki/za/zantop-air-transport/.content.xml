&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zantop Air Transport&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[United States]] airline formed from [[Zantop Flying Service]] in 1962.  The [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] approved transfer of the operating certificate of [[Coastal Airlines]] to Zantop Air Transport, which had incorporated and become a supplemental air carrier.  The former company had been a hauler for the [[Big Three automobile manufacturers|Big Three]] automakers.  With the new arrangement Zantop could provide individually waybilled services.  The original founders of Zantop Flying Services, the Zantop brothers, all sold their stock and resigned from the company in 1966, at which time it became [[Universal Airlines (US)|Universal Airlines]], Inc.

The airline was based at Wayne County Airport, Inster, Michigan.&amp;lt;ref name=ZAT&amp;gt;{{cite book |last=|first=|title=American Aviation|date=June 23, 1969|publisher=Ziff-Davis Pub. Co.|location=|pages=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
