&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zach Stevens&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[fictional character]] in the second season of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The O.C.]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, portrayed by [[Michael Cassidy (actor)|Michael Cassidy]].

==Background==
{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}
Zach comes fom a rich political family. His father is congressman of the Orange County.

==Conception==
Creator Josh Schwartz described Zach as someone &amp;quot;who&amp;apos;s sort of the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] Seth, a.k.a. the anti-Cohen, and a formidable potential opponent for Seth&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teenhollywood.com/d.asp?r=82329&amp;amp;cat=1035&amp;amp;p=7|title=&amp;quot;O.C.&amp;quot; creator Josh Schwartz: California Dreamin&amp;apos;|last=Barker|first=Lynn|date=2004-10-25|publisher=TeenHollywood.com|pages=7|accessdate=2008-07-27}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

===Season 2===
Zach joined Seth&amp;apos;s fledgling comic book club, becoming close friends with Seth. However, their friendship was tested when Seth learned that Zach was dating his ex-girlfriend, [[Summer Roberts]].

Zach and Seth decided to create a comic book together, called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Atomic County&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was centered on Orange County teenagers who had super powers and related to the core four. During the creation of the comic, Summer realized that she still had feelings for Seth, and went back to him.

Hurt, Zach made up a story that he had met an Italian girl while in Italy for his sister&amp;apos;s wedding; Seth and Summer quickly learned that the story was false. Zach and Seth physically fought over Summer at their comic book launch party, much to the chagrin of both Summer and book publisher [[List of recurring characters in The O.C.#Reed Carlson|Reed Carlson]]. After Summer told them that she would not date whomever was involved with the comic, Zach left Newport Beach to work with [[George Lucas]] on the comic, and Seth became involved with Summer again.
