The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zane family&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was important to the early history and settlement of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]].  The brothers [[Ebenezer Zane|Ebenezer]] (1747&amp;amp;ndash;1811) and Isaac Zane laid out sections of the [[Ohio Territory]], including the municipalities of [[Zanesville, Ohio|Zanesville]] and [[Zanesfield, Ohio|Zanesfield]].  Their sister was [[Betty Zane]] (1759–1823), heroine of the Revolutionary War.

* [[Isaac Zane]] (1753&amp;amp;ndash;1816) was kidnapped at age nine as a child by [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] Indians about 1762 from his family home near Moorefield, Virginia.  He was adopted into the tribe and lived with them for 17 years.  He married &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Myerrah&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (“White Crane”), the daughter of Chief [[Tarhe]], so had a prominent position within the tribe.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.wyandot.org/tarhe.htm Thelma Marsh, &amp;quot;Tarhe&amp;quot;], Wyandot Nation of Kansas Website&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
* Hannah Zane, mother of Elizabeth Burton Zane.
* Elizabeth Burton (Zane) Conley (1838–1879), Isaac&amp;apos;s granddaughter, was a multi-racial member of the Wyandots and mother of the [[Lyda Conley|Conley sisters]], born in Logan County, OH.  They saved the [[Wyandot National Burying Ground]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.wyandot.org/tarhe.htm &amp;quot;Burials at Huron Indian Cemetery&amp;quot;], Wyandot Nation of Kansas&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
* [[Zane Grey]] (1872&amp;amp;ndash;1939), a popular author of [[Western (genre)|Western]] novels, was the latest notable figure of the family.  Grey&amp;apos;s mother was a Zane descendant.  She named him Zane in honor of this maternal line.

Other places named for the family include:
* [[Zane Township, Logan County, Ohio]]
* [[Zane&amp;apos;s Trace]], an early road running through Ohio from [[Wheeling, West Virginia]] to [[Maysville, Kentucky]].
