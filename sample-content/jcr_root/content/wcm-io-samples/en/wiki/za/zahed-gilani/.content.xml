&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Taj Al-Din Ebrahim ibn Rushan Amir Al-Kurdi Al-Sanjani&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or Sinjani) (1216&amp;amp;ndash;1301) ({{lang-ar|تاج الدين ابراهيم الكردي السنجاني}}), titled [[Sheikh]] [[Zahed]] (or Zahid) Gilani, was Grandmaster ([[Murshid]] Kamil) of the famed [[Zahediyeh]] [[Sufi Order]] at [[Lahijan]]. He was of [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] descent.

Since the mid 13th century, Sheikh Zahed is revered as a spiritual authority and his tomb near [[Lahijan]] in [[Iran]]&amp;apos;s [[Gilan]] Province, on the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]], draws numerous pilgrims  to the picturesque village of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sheikhanvar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  His ancestors hailed from the ancient Iranian city of [[Sanjan (Khorasan)|Sanjan]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (located in present day Turkmenistan). Fleeing the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] [[invasion]] that would eventually conquer large parts of [[Iran|Persia]], his ancestors settled in Gilan in the late 11th century. Taj Al-Din Zahed Gilani was able to attain cultural and religious influence on the [[Ilkhanid]] rulers (1256–1353), descendants of [[Genghis Khan]], who followed Seljuq rule.

His most notable disciple was [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili]] (1252–1334), the [[Eponym]] of the [[Safavid Dynasty]] (1501–1736). He wed Zahed&amp;apos;s daughter [[Bibi Fatima]] and, overgoing the interest of Taj Al-Din Zahed&amp;apos;s firstborn son, Gamal Al-Din Ali, was entrusted with the Grand Master&amp;apos;s [[Zahediyeh]] [[Sufism|Sufi]] Order, which he transformed into his own, the [[Safaviyya]] (Sufi order) Order. Some 170 years after Safi Al-Din&amp;apos;s death, [[Safaviyya]] had gained sufficient political and military power to claim the Throne of (Northern) Iran for the [[Safavid]] Heir, [[Shah]] [[Ismail I]] Safavi. His second-born son, Sadr al-Dīn, wed [[Safi Al-Din]]&amp;apos;s daughter from a previous marriage. The two families were to be intertwined for many centuries to come, by blood as well as mutual spiritual causes.

The [[Sil-silat-al-nasab-e Safaviyeh]] or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Genealogy]] of the Safavids&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was written by [[Pir (Sufism)|Pir]] Hossein Abdul [[Zahedi]], a 17th century descendant of Zahed Gilani. This [[hagiography]] in praise of the [[Safavid Dynasty|Safavid]] forebears, was devoted to the genealogy of the Safavid Sufi masters.

The [[Turkish peoples|Turkish]] [[Bayrami]] and [[Jelveti]] orders also  had their origin in Zahed Gilani&amp;apos;s [[Zahediyeh]] [[Sufism|Sufi]] Order.
