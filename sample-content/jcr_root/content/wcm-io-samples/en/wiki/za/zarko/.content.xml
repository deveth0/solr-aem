==History==
Zarko&amp;apos;s initial name was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fayttos&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Φαϋττός), however still it is not clear at which exactly point the name changed to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zarko&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. There is also much speculation regarding the source of the name Zarko. Some people say that many [[roe deer]] (zarkadia, Greek: ζαρκάδια) used to live around the area, while others believe that this is actually the name (Zarko) of a [[Serbia]]n leader who ruled the area in the 14th century.

The fact is that it all started thousands of years ago as [[archaeological]] excavations in the wider area brought up buildings of a prehistoric settlement, probably of around 6500-5800 BC.

During the Turkish occupation years Zarko was one of the main centres of the wider [[Thessaly]] area. It had more than 5000 inhabitants and there was a [[Greeks|Greek]], a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and a [[Jewish]] area. Zarko&amp;apos;s people were mainly working in the fields producing cotton and they were quite capable of producing fabrics of the highest quality; in the late 19th century the &amp;apos;Zarkina pania&amp;apos; (cotton fabrics of Zarko) were well known in the area.

With most of [[Thessaly]], Zarko joined Greece in 1881. Nowadays you can still see the Turkish and the Greek forts that were built in the 19th century in order to define the borders between the 2 countries.

In the mid 1950’s Zarko was the very first village in the area to start modernising the traditional way of [[agriculture]]. It introduced the first ‘fabric made water-pipes’ that were used in order to water the cotton fields, as well as bringing in the area the first [[tractors]].

A special note needs to be done regarding the 12th century St. John’s [[monastery]] which is located around 2 kilometres north of Zarkos. Deserted for many years it is now reconstructed and occupied with nuns.
