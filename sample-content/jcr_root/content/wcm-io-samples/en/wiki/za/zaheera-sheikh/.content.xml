&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zaheera Sheikh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-gu|જ઼્આહીરા શેખ}}), aka Zahira Sheikh, is the [[Wikitionary:key|key]] [[witness]] in India&amp;apos;s [[Best Bakery case]]. She is the daughter of the owner of the bakery involved in the Best Bakery case.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

On March 1, 2002, 12 Muslims and 2 others were burnt alive in the premises of the bakery, &amp;quot;allegedly by a Hindu mob&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name =BBC/&amp;gt;

She has indicated her desire to contest elections for the [[Gujarat]] elections if she was fielded by a political party.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/06/20/stories/2007062051350100.htm Zahira wants to contest elections]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In January 2005, the [[Supreme Court of India]] ordered an inquiry into the repeated change of statement by Zaheera. In August 2005, a Supreme Court committee indicted Sheikh as a &amp;quot;self-condemned liar&amp;quot; falling to &amp;quot;inducements&amp;quot; by &amp;quot;certain persons&amp;quot; to give &amp;quot;inconsistent&amp;quot; statements during the trial of the case.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/aug/29best.htm Supreme Court panel calls Zahira a liar]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The sister-in-law of Zaheera claimed that Zaheera was lying.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-07-20/india/27187846_1_zahira-madhu-shrivastav-yasmin-banu-sheikh Sister-in-law says Zahira is lying]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In March 2006, the [[Supreme Court of India]] found her guilty of [[perjury]] in the same case. She was sentenced to a year in prison and was also fined an amount equal to Rs. 50,000 (approximately $1,000).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/india-news/full_story.php?content_id=89389 Zaheera Sheikh turns herself in, says don’t send me to Gujarat]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The court also instructed tax authorities to investigate her assets since the start of the infamous trial as she is widely suspected of having accepted numerous bribes to change her testimony in court. She was ordered to undergo her term in a [[Mumbai]] prison.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

The Indian newspaper, [[Tehelka]], aired a secretly-filmed video in which the politician Madhu Srivastava is alleged to have paid 1.8 million rupees ($36,000) to Zaheera. Both have denied giving or receiving the bribe.&amp;lt;ref name =BBC&amp;gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4117875.stm Politician denies bribing witness]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The Majlis-e-Shura, an apex decision making body of Muslims in India, declared Zaheera an outcast after it learned of the Tehelka reports, and Zaheera&amp;apos;s false statements. Islamic scholars denounced &amp;quot;lying&amp;quot; as against &amp;quot;the principles of Islam and Koran&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://in.rediff.com/news/2004/dec/24best.htm Masjlis-e-Shura declares Zaheera an outcast]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
