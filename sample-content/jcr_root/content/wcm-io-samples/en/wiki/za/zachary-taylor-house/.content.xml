The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zachary Taylor House&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Springfield&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was the boyhood home of the twelfth [[President of the United States]], [[Zachary Taylor]]. Located in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], Taylor lived there from 1790 to 1808, held his marriage there in 1810, and returned there periodically the rest of his life.

==History==
Zachary Taylor&amp;apos;s father, Colonel [[Richard Taylor (colonel)|Richard Taylor]], purchased a {{convert|400|acre|km2|sing=on}} farm on the Muddy Fork of [[Beargrass Creek]] in 1785, while Zachary was eight months old.  They initially lived in a log cabin on the property, but within the first five years Richard Taylor built a house at the highest point on his property, dubbing it &amp;quot;Springfield&amp;quot;.  By 1800 Richard Taylor purchased an additional three hundred acres, making his property {{convert|700|acre|km2}} in total.  The property was adjacent to [[Historic Locust Grove|Locust Grove]], the farm where [[George Rogers Clark]] lived from 1809 until his death in 1818.  Before he began his military career in 1808, Zachary Taylor lived twenty years in the house.  He would later return to the house to be married on June 18, 1810, and have five of his six children born in the house.  In 1829 the house was sold upon Richard Taylor&amp;apos;s death, due to debts he had acquired.  Zachary Taylor would be buried in the family cemetery located on the property; the cemetery would later become [[Zachary Taylor National Cemetery]].&amp;lt;ref name=Hayne&amp;gt;Hayne, Hugh. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/66000359.pdf Zachary Taylor House]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1974) pg.2,3,6&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Kleber, John E.  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Encyclopedia of Louisville&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. (University Press of Kentucky). pg.868,869.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Much of the original Taylor property remained together until the 1950s, when it was divided. Of the original {{convert|400|acre|km2}}, the Taylor property is only 3/4 of an acre in size.&amp;lt;ref name=autogenerated1&amp;gt;Hayne pg.2&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

During the [[Super Outbreak]] of tornadoes on April 3â€“4, 1974, Springfield suffered major wind and water damage, including the two porches and the roof being blown off.&amp;lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&amp;gt;

There have been attempts to make the house a [[National Historic Sites (United States)|National Historic Site]], but these attempts have failed due to the required demolition of surrounding buildings needed to make it a National Historic Site.&amp;lt;ref name=autogenerated2&amp;gt;[http://www.presidentialavenue.com/zt.cfm Presidential Avenue: Zachary Taylor&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Construction==
[[Image:Taylorhomerear.jpg|left|thumb|The rear side of the home]]
Springfield is a {{frac|2|1|2}}-story Georgia Colonial red brick L-shaped house. The western section of the house is the oldest, built around 1790.  The eastern section was built between 1810 and 1830.  It features a gable roof, a double-parlor, and fireplaces in each room.  It was constructed by Richard Taylors and the slaves he owned.&amp;lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&amp;gt;

After the Taylors left, major additions included two Victorian porches, an altering of a staircase&amp;apos;s direction, and the eaves improved with a bracketed cornice.  Two bathrooms were added to the first floor in the 1930s.&amp;lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&amp;gt;

Today, the address of the house is 5608 Apache Road, Louisville, Kentucky.&amp;lt;ref name=Hayne /&amp;gt;
