&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zacky Vengeance&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zachary James Baker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ; December 11, 1981)  is the [[rhythm guitar]]ist and [[backing vocalist]] for the American [[heavy metal music|metal]]/[[rock music|rock]] band [[Avenged Sevenfold]].

==Biography==
[[File:Avenged-Sevenfold-BergenCalling-2011-Christian Misje-5503.jpg|thumb|left|Zacky Vengeance with Synyster Gates live in Bergen, Norway - 2011]]
Baker attended [[Huntington Beach High School]], and formed Avenged Sevenfold there with [[M. Shadows]] and [[The Rev]]. Before Avenged Sevenfold, his first band was a [[crust punk]] band called Society Down. He&amp;apos;s said before that a demo exists, but lost it years ago. After Society Down, he formed a [[punk rock|punk]] band called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;MPA*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which stands for Mad Porno Action. He implied that they were both not successful. Baker came up with his stage name &amp;quot;Zacky Vengeance&amp;quot; because he wanted to get back at all the people from his youth who doubted his potential. He also came up with Jonathan Seward&amp;apos;s stage name &amp;quot;[[Johnny Christ]],&amp;quot; saying it suited him. Vengeance was also responsible for the creation of the initialism &amp;quot;[[A7X]]&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[All Excess]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Avenged Sevenfold DVD (2007)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Despite playing the guitar left handed, Vengeance recalls the first guitar he learned to play on was actually a right-handed his parents had bought him for his thirteenth birthday. He learned by playing upside-down, watching his favorite bands and other people he knew who played, and practiced as much as he could. He would also read each edition of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Guitar World]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; cover to cover, learning the tabs of the songs published there and watching the professionals perform them until he could play them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
