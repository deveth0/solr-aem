&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zayed Sports City Stadium&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ZSC Stadium&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]].&amp;lt;ref name=zsc&amp;gt;[http://www.zsc.ae/en/12/facilities/zayed-sports-city-stadium Zayed Sports City Stadium]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches but can also stage [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], large events, [[Rugby football|rugby]] and other grass sports. It is named after the late Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], the founder and first president of the UAE.

==History==
The construction of the stadium was completed in 1979 and it originally was designed to hold 60,000 people. However, after renovations to make the stadium comply with FIFA safety standards, its capacity diminished to 43,000 people. It has hosted many international and regional events such as the FIFA Club World Cup in 2009 and 2010 and the GCC football tournament in 1982, 1994, and in 2007. It was also a venue for the Asian Federation Cup final in 1996 between the host UAE, and Saudi Arabia when the latter won the championship from the penalty spot. A major event held in this stadium was the opening and final match of the FIFA Youth World Cup in 2003. Every year, the UAE cup final is played here.

This was also the venue for the game between Manchester City Football Club and the UAE National Team on November 12, 2009. The final score was 1–0 to the UAE National Team.

The stadium hosted the [[2009 FIFA Club World Cup|2009]] and [[2010 FIFA Club World Cup]]s with [[Al Jazira Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium]]. It hosted 5 of the 8 matches of the tournament including the finals.
