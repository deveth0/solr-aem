&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hwaeom&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  is the name of the [[Korea]]n transmission of the [[Huayan school]] of [[Chinese Buddhism]].

The greatest lasting impact of the Huayan school was to be seen in Korea, where it was transmitted by [[Uisang]] ([[hangul]]:의상대사 625-702), who had been, along with [[Fazang]], a student of [[Zhiyan]]. After Uisang returned to Korea in 671, he worked vigorously toward the establishment of the Hwaeom school on [[Korea]]. In this effort, he was greatly aided by the powerful influences of his friend [[Wonhyo]] ([[hangul]]:원효대사, [[hanja]]:元曉), who although not an official representative of the school, relied deeply on Hwaeom metaphysical principles to establish his concept of interpenetrated Buddhism (通佛教).

After the passing of these two early monks, the Hwaeom school became strongly established under the influence of a long series of Hwaeom masters. The Hwaeom school remained in the position of predominant doctrinal school up until the end of the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty, when it was placed into a forced merger with the [[Korean Buddhism#Seon|Seon]] school ([[hangul]]:선종, [[hanja]]:禪宗). Within the Seon school, Hwaeom thought would continue to play a strong role, and continues as such to modern times.
