&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eriador&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a large region in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]&amp;apos;s fictional world of [[Middle-earth]]. In the [[Second Age]], and possibly much earlier, it was largely forested, but the [[Dúnedain]] felled most of the forests to build [[ship]]s. Much of it was encompassed in the early [[Third Age]] by the kingdom of [[Arnor]], which later split into the rival kingdoms of [[Rhudaur]], [[Arthedain]] and [[Cardolan]]. [[Shire (Middle-earth)|The Shire]] occupies part of the former kingdom of Arthedain, while [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]] and its neighbouring villages lie on the border with the former Cardolan. The [[Barrow-wight]]s dwell within ancient burial mounds constructed in the [[First Age]] by the [[Edain]] as they journeyed to [[Beleriand]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Other important places in Eriador are [[Rivendell]], the [[Grey Havens]] and the abandoned kingdoms of [[Eregion]] and [[Angmar]]. By the time of the [[War of the Ring]], Eriador was sparsely populated, save for the Shire, Bree-land, Rivendell, the Grey Havens, the Angle south of Rivendell, and villages in western Eriador. Communities of [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] still mined the Ered Lindon, and a small population of former enemies of [[Númenor]] survived in southern [[Minhiriath]]. Eriador was protected by the [[Rangers of the North]].

Its boundaries were:
* To the east, the [[Misty Mountains]].
* To the north, the Ice-bay of [[Forochel]], which flooded part of the lands of [[Morgoth]] after the [[War of Wrath]].
* To the west, the mountains of Ered Lindon (also known as Ered Luin or Blue Mountains)
* To the south, the rivers [[Glanduin]] and [[Greyflood]] and the land of [[Enedwaith]]. After the War of Wrath, part of the southwestern border lies along the shores of [[Belegaer]].

Eriador extended for some 600 miles north-south and 700 miles west-east. It was traversed by the [[East Road|East-West Road]] running from Rivendell to the Grey Havens and by the [[Greenway (Middle-earth)|Greenway]] (former [[List of Middle-earth roads|North-South Road]] connecting the kingdoms of Arnor and [[Gondor]]). Important rivers were the Lune ([[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Lhûn]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), the Brandywine (Elvish &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Baranduin]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and the Greyflood (Elvish &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Gwathló]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

==Depictions in adaptations==
Eriador was the initial setting of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Lord of the Rings Online]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; video game. Notably, both narrator (Gandalf) and characters in-game refer to various dangers as &amp;quot;The Doom of Eriador&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;A Threat to all of Eriador&amp;quot; instead of Middle-earth as a whole. The game was later expanded to include other Regions of Middle-earth, such as [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], [[Lothlorien]] and [[Mirkwood]].
