&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ermanaric&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-got|Aírmanareiks}}; {{lang-la|Ermanaricus}};  {{lang-ang|Eormenric}}; {{lang-on|Jörmunrekkr}}; died 376) was a [[Greuthungi|Greuthungian]] [[Goths|Gothic]] [[Germanic kingship|King]] who before the [[Huns|Hunnic]] invasion evidently ruled a sizable portion of [[Oium]], the part of [[Scythia]] inhabited by the Goths at the time. He is mentioned in two Roman sources; the contemporary writings of [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] and in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Getica]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by the 6th-century historian [[Jordanes]].

According to Ammianus, Ermanaric was &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;a most warlike king&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; who eventually committed suicide, faced with the aggression of the [[Alani]] and of the [[Hun]]s, who invaded his territories in the 370s. Ammianus says he &amp;quot;ruled over extensively wide and fertile regions&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Kulikowski&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{citation|author=Michael Kulikowski |title=Rome&amp;apos;s Gothic Wars |year=2007 |pages=111,112 |id=ISBN 0251846331}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Ammianus&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{citation |author=[[Ammianus Marcellinus]]| url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/31*.html#3 |title=Res Gestae XXXI 3 |editor=Thayer}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Ammianus also says that after Ermanaric´s death, a certain [[Vithimiris]] was elected as a new king.

According to [[Jordanes]]&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Getica]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Ermanaric ruled the realm of [[Oium]]. He describes him as a  &amp;quot;Gothic Alexander&amp;quot; who &amp;quot;ruled all the nations of [[Scythia]] and [[Germania]] as they were his own&amp;quot;. Jordanes also states that the king put to death a young woman named [[Sunilda]] with the use of horses, because of her infidelity. Thereupon her two brothers, Sarus and [[Ammius]], severely wounded Ermanaric leaving him unfit to defend his kingdom from Hunnic incursions. Variations of this legend had a profound effect on medieval Germanic literature, including that of [[England]] and [[Scandinavia]] (see [[Jonakr&amp;apos;s sons]]). Jordanes claims that he successfully ruled the [[Goths]] until his death at the age of 110.

==In Germanic legend==
Ermanaric also appears  in [[Norse mythology|Scandinavian]] and [[Anglo-Saxon]] legend.
Here, Ermanaric is ill-advised by Bicke, Bikka or Sifka, who wants revenge for the rape of his wife by Ermanaric. Also in some tales of [[Dietrich von Bern|Dietrich of Bern]], Ermanaric is Dietrich&amp;apos;s uncle who stole the kingdom. This adviser advised Ermanaric to kill those closest to him.

== Name ==
Ermanaric&amp;apos;s name in his native [[Gothic language|Gothic]] was probably &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aírmanareiks&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. However, because he is referred to in literature throughout the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] world right up until the 13th century his name takes many forms:

Latin names:
* in [[Jordanes]]&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Getica]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, he is called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ermanaricus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hermanaricus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but some of the manuscripts even have &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Armanaricus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hermericus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hermanericus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; etc.
* in [[Ammianus]]&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Res gestae&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, he is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ermenrichus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (his name occurs only once).

Germanic names:
* in the [[Old English language|Old English]] epic &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Beowulf]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, he is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eormenric&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; the alternative spelling &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eormanric&amp;apos;&amp;apos; occurs in the poems &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Deor]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Widsith]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,
* in [[Old Norse]] he is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jörmunrekkr&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,
* in [[Middle High German]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ermenrîch&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

He is also called Hermanaric, Erminrich, Emmerich, Ermanrik and many other names.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~dlemrick/Emmerich1.htm The Name of Emmerich Pt. 1&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Since the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Heiðrekr&amp;apos;&amp;apos; may have been confused with Ermanaric{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} through folk etymology he is possibly identical to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Heiðrekr Ulfhamr&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the [[Hervarar saga]], who was said to have ruled the Goths for a long time.
