&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Erlestoke&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a village and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] about {{convert|6|mi|km}} southwest of the [[market town]] of [[Devizes]] in [[Wiltshire]].

==History==
The current form of the village of Erlestoke is largely due to [[Joshua Smith (English politician)|Joshua Smith]], a [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Devizes]]. Between the 1780s and the 1810s Smith was responsible for replacing the existing Elizabethan house with one higher up the hill east of the village, landscaping the park, and moving the houses of the village to the current High Street, where he added picturesque estate cottages incorporating pieces of sculpture and architectural fragments from the old [[manor house]].

Erlestoke House was seriously damaged by a fire in 1950. It is now part of [[Erlestoke (HM Prison)|HM Prison Erlestoke]].

==Local government==
Erlestoke has an elected [[Parish councils in England|parish council]]. It is in the area of [[Wiltshire Council]] [[unitary authority]], which is responsible for all significant [[local government]] functions.

Erlestoke was in the [[Kennet (district)|District of Kennet]] until the four Wiltshire [[Districts of England|district councils]] were dissolved in 2009.

==Prison==
HM Prison Erlestoke is the only prison in Wiltshire. It has a capacity of 410 men.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/global/contacts/noms/prison-finder/erlestoke/ |title=Erlestoke Prison |publisher=[[HM Prison Service]]
