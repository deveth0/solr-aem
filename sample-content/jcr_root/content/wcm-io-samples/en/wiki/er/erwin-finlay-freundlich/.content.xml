        text="&lt;p&gt;[[Image:Babelsberg Einsteinturm.jpg|thumb|[[Einstein Tower]] in [[Potsdam]]]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Erwin Finlay-Freundlich&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (May 29, 1885 – July 24, 1964) was a [[Germany|German]] [[astronomer]], a pupil of [[Felix Klein]]. He was born in [[Wiesbaden-Biebrich|Biebrich]], Germany to Friedrich Freundlich and Ellen Finlayson.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58485.html}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;   Freundlich was a working associate of [[Albert Einstein]] and introduced experiments for which the [[general theory of relativity]] could be tested by astronomical observations based on the [[gravitational redshift]].

After finishing his thesis with Felix Klein at the [[University of Göttingen]] in 1910, he became assistant at the Observatory in Berlin, where he became associated with Einstein. During a solar eclipse expedition in 1914 to verify general relativity, [[World War I]] broke out and he was interned in Russia. After the war, he was engaged in construction of a solar observatory in Potsdam, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Einsteinturm&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and he was director of the Einstein-Institut. In 1933 Hitler came to power and Freundlich was forced to leave Germany; he had a Jewish grandmother and his wife was Jewish. He was appointed professor at the [[University of Istanbul]], which was reformed by [[Kemal Atatürk]] with the help of many German scholars.  In 1937 he left Istanbul to take up the post of professor of astronomy at the [[Charles University of Prague]], but this appointment was terminated by the German occupation. On the recommendation of [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]] he went to [[St. Andrews University]] in Scotland. From 1951 to 1959 he was [[John Napier]] professor of Astronomy. On his retirement he returned to his native town Wiesbaden and was appointed professor at the [[University of Mainz]]. Freundlich died in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany.

Freundlich researched the deflection of light rays passing close to the Sun. He proposed an experiment, during an eclipse, to verify the validity of Einstein&amp;apos;s theory of general relativity. Freundlich&amp;apos;s demonstration would have proven [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]&amp;apos;s theories incorrect. He did conduct inconclusive tests on the prediction by Einstein&amp;apos;s theory of gravitation-induced red shift of spectral lines in the Sun, using the solar observatories he had constructed in Potsdam and Istanbul.
In 1953 he proposed with [[Max Born]] an alternative explanation of the red shifts observed in galaxies by a [[tired light]] model.
