&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ernest George Jansen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1881–1959) was the second-last [[Governor-General of the Union of South Africa]], holding office from 1950 to 1959.

Born in 7 August 1881, he graduated with a law degree from the [[University of South Africa|University of the Cape of Good Hope]] in 1905, and was admitted as an advocate (the South African equivalent of a [[barrister]]) in 1913.

An ardent champion of [[Afrikaner]] interests, he joined the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] in 1915 and was a member of Parliament from 1915 to 1920, from 1921 to 1943, and from 1947 to 1950.

In 1919, he was a member of a delegation which tried unsuccessfully to persuade American president [[Woodrow Wilson]] to call for independence to be restored to the former [[Boer]] republics of the [[Orange Free State]] and the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]].

In Parliament, Jansen was [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the House of Assembly from 1924 to 1929, Minister of Native Affairs and of Irrigation from 1929 to 1934, and Speaker again from 1934 to 1943.  He was highly regarded for his firm and impartial speakership.

He was Minister of Native Affairs again from 1948 to 1950, but was thought to be too soft on the new policy of [[apartheid]], for which his department was primarily responsible. He was subsequently replaced by hardliner [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] and formally promoted by Prime Minister [[Daniel Malan]] to the politically neutral post of Governor-General once vacant. As an [[Afrikaner nationalist]] and stout republican, Jansen declined to wear the ceremonial uniform, or to take the oath of allegiance to the monarch whom he represented.  He held office until his death in 1959, when he was succeeded by Minister of Justice [[Charles Robberts Swart]].

Jansen married Martha Mabel Pellissier in 1912.  Both were prominent figures in Afrikaner cultural circles.  Jansen was a founder member of the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns (the &amp;quot;South African Academy for Science and Art&amp;quot;) in 1909, of the Saamwerk-Unie (&amp;quot;Co-operation Union&amp;quot;) in 1917, of the Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge (&amp;quot;Federation of Afrikaner Cultural Associations&amp;quot;) in 1929, and of the [[Voortrekkers (youth organization)|Voortrekkers]] (the Afrikaner equivalent of the [[Scouting in South Africa|Boy Scouts]] and [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Girl Guides]]) in 1930, and was master of ceremonies at the laying of the foundation stone of the [[Voortrekker Monument]] in 1938 and at its dedication in 1949.
