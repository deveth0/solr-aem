&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ernst Engel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (March 26, 1821 – December 8, 1896) was a [[Germany|German]] [[statistician]] and [[economist]], famous for the [[Engel curve]] and the [[Engel&amp;apos;s law]].

==Biography==
Ernst was born in [[Dresden]] in 1821. He studied at the famous [[Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg|mining academy of Freiberg]], in [[Saxony]], and on completing his curriculum traveled in Germany and France.

Immediately after the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|revolution of 1848]], he was attached to the royal commission in Saxony appointed to determine the relations between trade and labor. In 1850, he was directed by the government to assist in the organization of the German Industrial Exhibition of [[Leipzig]] (the first of its kind). His efforts were so successful that, in 1854, he was induced to enter the government service, as chief of the newly instituted statistical department. He retired, however, from the office in 1858. He founded at Dresden the first Mortgage Insurance Society (Hypotheken-Versicherungsgesellschaft), and as a result of the success of his work, was summoned in 1860 to [[Berlin]] as director of the statistical department, in succession to [[Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Dieterici]]. In his new office, he made himself a name of worldwide reputation. Raised to the rank of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Geheimer Regierungsrat&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, he retired in 1882 and lived henceforward in Serkowitz, today part of [[Radebeul]] near Dresden, where he died in 1896. Engel was a voluminous writer on the subjects with which his name is connected, but his statistical papers are mostly published in the periodicals which he himself established, namely, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Preuss. Statistik&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (in 1861); &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zeitschrift des Statistischen Bureaus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zeitschrift des Statistischen Bureaus des Königreichs Sachsen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
