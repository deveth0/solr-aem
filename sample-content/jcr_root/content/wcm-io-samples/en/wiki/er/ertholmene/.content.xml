&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ertholmene&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, generally called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Christiansø&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a small archipelago situated approximately 18&amp;amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Bornholm]] in the [[Baltic Sea]]. Its permanent population is 96 ({{As of|2008|lc=on}}) and its area is {{convert|39|ha|km2}}. Ertholmene belongs to [[Denmark]] and has the country&amp;apos;s [[Extreme points of Denmark|easternmost point]].

Ertholmene consists of three main islands, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Christiansø&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (named after [[Christian V of Denmark|King Christian V]]), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Frederiksø]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (named after [[Frederick IV of Denmark|King Frederick IV]]) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Græsholm]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, plus a number of minor rocks and [[skerry|skerries]]. The best known of the latter are [[Tat (skerry)|Tat]] and [[Østerskær]], Denmark&amp;apos;s easternmost point. Christiansø makes up 22.3 [[hectare]]s, Frederiksø 4, and [[Græsholm]] 11 hectares. Only Christiansø and Frederiksø are inhabited, while Græsholm is a bird reserve. The sound between Christiansø and Frederiksø, a well-sheltered natural harbour, is crossed by a pedestrian bridge that is pulled aside to accommodate larger vessels.

==History==

Fishermen from Bornholm have used Ertholmene for temporary shelter since the [[Middle Ages]]. The first permanent inhabitation was the result of the Danish-Swedish conflicts in the late 17th century. As Denmark needed a naval base in the central Baltic Sea, a [[fort]] was built on Christiansø and Frederiksø in 1684 which served as an outpost for the [[Royal Danish Navy|Danish Navy]] until 1855. [[Christiansø Church]] originally served the garrison.&amp;lt;ref name=natmus&amp;gt;[http://danmarkskirker.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Bornholm_532-555.pdf Otto Norn, C. G. Schultz, Erik Skov, &amp;quot;Christiansø Kirke&amp;quot;]: Bornholms Nørre Herred, Danmarks Kirker, Bornholm, Nationalmuseet, Gad, 1954, pp. 576–583. {{da icon}} Retrieved 2 October 2012&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The population peaked at the census in 1810 which showed 829 inhabitants. Many of the historical buildings now serve as living quarters for the local population, and some are rented, year after year, to regular summer residents. The islands&amp;apos; external appearance has changed very little in over 300 years. Girdled by thick granite walls with old cannons pointed seaward, Christiansø is a picturesque tourist spot seemingly frozen in time.  A former part of the fort, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Store Tårn&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has housed the [[Christiansø Lighthouse]] for the past 200 years,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Anker E. Kofoed: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Christiansøs Historie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Christiansøs Museum, 1984. {{da icon}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and a small round tower on Frederiksø, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lille Tårn,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; serves as a museum.

==Administrative status==

The islands are state property - an [[unincorporated area]] - and do not belong to either a municipality or a region, instead, they are governed by an administrator appointed by the Danish ministry of defence which is responsible for carrying out the tasks normally performed by municipalities. Major sources of income are [[fishery]] and [[tourism]]. There are 80,000 tourists per year, mostly day visitors arriving via Bornholm. Ertholmene is also a popular destination for [[yachting|yachts]].

The islanders will be exempt from the central government 8% &amp;quot;Health Contribution&amp;quot; tax (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sundhedsbidrag&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) introduced with [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipal Reform 2007|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kommunalreformen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;The Municipal Reform&amp;quot; of 2007)]], because it is anticipated the relatively isolated islets would otherwise be abandoned. This tax replaced the [[Counties of Denmark|county]] tax, which the islanders were also exempt from paying, not being part of a county.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.bornholm.nu/?Id=10317 Bornholm.nu » Christiansø » Ingen sundhedsskat på Chr.ø&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.bornholm.nu/?Id=7904 Bornholm.nu » Christiansø » Bornholm kan få Christiansø&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
