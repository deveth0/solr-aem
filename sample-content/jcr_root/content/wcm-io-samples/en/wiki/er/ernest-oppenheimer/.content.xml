        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sir Ernest Oppenheimer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (22 May 1880 – 25 November 1957) was a [[diamond]] and [[gold]] mining entrepreneur, [[financier]] and [[philanthropist]], who controlled [[De Beers Consolidated Mines|De Beers]] and founded the [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American Corporation]] of [[South Africa]].

==Career==

He was born in [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]], Germany, the son of Edward Oppenheimer, a [[cigar]] merchant. Oppenheimer began his working life at 17, when he entered Dunkelsbuhler &amp;amp; Company, a diamond brokerage in [[London]]. His efforts impressed his employer and in 1902, at the age of 22, he was sent to South Africa to represent the [[company (law)|company]] as a buyer in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], where he eventually rose to the position of mayor.

In 1927, he managed to wrest control of [[Cecil Rhodes]]&amp;apos; [[De Beers]] empire, building and consolidating the company&amp;apos;s global monopoly over the world&amp;apos;s diamond industry until his retirement. During this time, he was involved in a number of controversies, including price fixing, [[antitrust]] behaviour and an allegation of not releasing industrial diamonds for the US war effort during [[World War II]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=raO8jHBdDhYC|title=Glitter &amp;amp; Greed|author=Janine P. Roberts|isbn=0-9713942-9-6|publisher=The Disinformation Company|year=2003|accessdate=2008-11-27}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8le1AAAAIAAJ|title=Ernest Oppenheimer and the Economic Development of Southern Africa|author=Theodor Emanuel Gregory|publisher=Arno Press|year=1977|accessdate=2008-11-27}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He died in [[Johannesburg]] in 1957. He was born into a [[Jew]]ish family, but as an adult converted to [[Christianity]] and was buried at St George&amp;apos;s Church, [[Parktown, Gauteng|Parktown]]. He was succeeded in the business by his son [[Harry Oppenheimer]]. Oppenheimer&amp;apos;s brother, [[Bernard Oppenheimer|Sir Bernard Oppenheimer]], was also heavily involved in the diamond industry.

In 1964, the [[Oppenheimer Diamond]] was named in his honour by its owner, [[Harry Winston]], who donated the stone (not a [[Gemstone|gem]] as it remains uncut and unpolished) to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] as a memorial.
