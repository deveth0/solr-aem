The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ertl Company&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an American [[toy]] company best known for its die-cast metal alloy collectible replicas (or [[scale models]]) of [[farm equipment]] and vehicles. The company is based in Dyersville, Iowa, home of the [[National Farm Toy Museum]]. In the 1990s, Ertl also began production in Mexico and laid off employees of the original Ertl factory, which became a distribution facility and outlet store.

==Plastic model kits==
In the late 1970s, Ertl offered a series of plastic model kits of tractors, plows, and farm wagons. Although these kits never achieved the hoped-for popularity, they apparently led to the 1981 acquisition of [[Aluminum Metal Toys|AMT.]]

==American muscle diecast==
In the early 1990s Ertl started the American Muscle line up of diecast collectible cars and trucks.  These were 1:18 scale replicas that quickly found a dedicated following of baby boomers.  Limited editions of 2,500 were especially sought after.  Many of the earliest releases have fetched upwards of $500.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The most popular and desirable is the [[1957 Chevrolet|1957 Chevy]] [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]] known as Peggy Sue.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==History==
Ertl has been producing farm toy replicas since 1945. For over 60 years, the company has produced farm toys for industry brands such as: [[John Deere]], [[Case IH]], [[New Holland Ag|New Holland]], and [[AGCO]]. Ertl has also, on different occasions, acquired the licenses to produce die-cast vehicles and [[figurine]]s as well as [[scale model|model kits]] for [[Garfield]], [[Thomas the Tank Engine]], [[Super Mario Bros (film)| Super Mario Bros.]] [[DC Comics]], and [[Star Wars]].  In 1999 Ertl was purchased by [[Racing Champions]]. Ertl is currently a brand under the [[RC2 Corporation]] umbrella.
