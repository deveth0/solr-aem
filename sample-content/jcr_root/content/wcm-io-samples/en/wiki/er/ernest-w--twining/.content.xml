        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ernest W. Twining&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (March 29, 1875 - September 10, 1956) was a modelmaker, artist, and engineer.

==Biography==
Ernest Twining was born in [[Bristol]], [[England]], and was trained as a [[telephone]] engineer. He also took art lessons at night school. After working on the [[Glasgow]] telephone system for a while, he established a commercial [[art studio]] in [[London]], where, as a side-line, he branched out into designing and making [[model aircraft]] for sale, in due course expanding to the manufacture of full size [[Glider aircraft|gliders]].

==Twining Models==
His model-making work brought him into contact with [[Bassett-Lowke]], the Northampton model making firm, for whom he did sub-contract work. In 1920 he founded [[Twining Models]] at Northampton, which manufactured glass-case models of industrial, architectural, advertising and transport themes.

==Other interests==
Twining was polymathic in his interests, and was active in the worlds of model railways, art and design, aeronautics, astronomy and photography, ships and ship models, and stained glass.

In Northampton, his windows can be found at Holy Trinity Church Hall, St Edmunds, Hardingstone, St Francis de Sales, Wolverton and the Northhampton Museum.

==Writing==
Twining was also a prolific author, writing for numerous hobby magazines, and wrote several books, the most notable being:
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Art and Craft of Stained Glass&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1928), long regarded as the best text book available.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Art in Advertising&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1931) (with Dorothy E. M. Holditch).
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Indoor Model Railways&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1937)

==World War II==
Twining sold out his interest in his business in 1940, and moved back to Bristol where he spent the [[World War II|war years]] on the staff of the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]], working as a [[draughtsman]]. After the war he worked for a Bristol [[stained glass]] firm, helping repair damaged glass in bombed churches. Twining died at Bristol in 1956.

==In Japan==
A 15-inch gauge miniature steam locomotive named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ernest W. Twining&amp;apos;&amp;apos; exists in Japan at the [[Shuzenji Romney Railway]] in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]. This originally worked at [[Dudley Zoo]] in the [[UK]] before moving to the [[Fairbourne Railway]] in 1961. It was a freelance 4-6-2 (2-C-1) Pacific tender loco designed by Twining and built by G &amp;amp; S Light Engineering &amp;amp; Maintenance Co., Ltd. in [[Stourbridge]], West Midlands, in 1950 to Works No. 10. Although the worksplate which it has states year built as 1949, this is incorrect, and the plate was fitted by the Fairbourne Railway, not by the builder.{{Fact|date=February 2009}} Driving wheels are 20&amp;quot; diameter, with two cylinders of 5 1/16&amp;quot; diameter, 8&amp;quot; stroke and piston valves. The locomotive is equipped with steam brakes, and hand brakes on the tender. Bogie tender air brakes and a new boiler were fitted in 1961.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Brown, Colin. &amp;quot;Ernest W. Twining&amp;quot; in Bullet-In issue 56, October - December 2005&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
