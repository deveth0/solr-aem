&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eric Stenkilsson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a contender for the Swedish kingship 1066–67. After the death of King [[Stenkil]], he made war on [[Eric the Pagan]] for the Swedish throne. Both died in the war. The two rival Eriks are only known by their first name and from one source ([[Adam of Bremen]]). Thus, the idea that he was the son of King [[Stenkil]] and the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Erik Stenkilsson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as well as the opponent&amp;apos;s pagan belief, are purely conjectural.

Referring to him as King Eric VII or VIII are later inventions, counting backwards from [[Eric XIV of Sweden|Eric XIV]] (1560–68). He and his brother [[Charles IX of Sweden|Charles IX]] (1604–1611) adopted numerals according to a fictitious history of Sweden. The number of Swedish monarchs named Eric before Eric XIV (at least seven) is unknown, going back into [[prehistory]], and none of them used numerals. It would be speculative to try to affix a mathematically accurate one to this king.
