&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ntare V of Burundi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (b. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Charles Ndizeye&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 2 December 1947 — 29 April 1972) was the [[king of Burundi]] from June to November 1966. Until his accession, he was known as Crown Prince &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Charles Ndizeye&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He deposed his father, [[Mwambutsa IV]] (d. [[Switzerland]], 1977) in 1966. King Ntare himself was deposed in a [[military coup]] led by [[Michel Micombero]] in 1966; the King went into exile in [[West Germany]].

He once made a short visit to Denmark because of his great interest in the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]].

Ntare V returned to [[Burundi]] in April 1972. Soon afterwards the [[Hutu]]s began an uprising against the government. On April 29, reportedly at the behest of President Micombero, Ntare was executed at the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ibwami]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; royal palace in [[Gitega]], though little information is available on the exact circumstances. The Hutu uprising was quelled by Micombero&amp;apos;s forces. About 150,000 people, mostly [[Hutus]], died in the ensuing inter-tribal fighting.

Ntare V was educated at [[Institut Le Rosey]] in [[Switzerland]].  His mother was Queen Baramparaye (1929—2007); he had one brother (Prince [[Louis Rwagasore]], assassinated 1961 whilst Prime Minister, and two sisters; Princess Rose Paula Iribagiza (b. 1934) and Princess Regina Kanyange (d. 1987).
