An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;NTFS junction point&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a feature of the [[NTFS]] [[file system]] that provides the ability to create a [[symbolic link]] to a [[Directory (file systems)|directory]] which then functions as an alias of that directory. This has many benefits over a [[Windows shell]] [[Computer shortcut|shortcut]] (.lnk) file, such as allowing access to files within the directory via [[Windows Explorer]], the [[Command Prompt (Windows)|Command Prompt]], etc.

Junction points can only link to directories on a local volume; junction points to remote shares are unsupported.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;junction&amp;quot;&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Junction points are a type of [[NTFS reparse point]]; they were introduced with NTFS 3.0, the default file system for [[Windows 2000]] (Windows NT 5.0). The Windows 2000 and [[Windows 2003]] [[Resource Kit]]s include a program called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;linkd&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; which provided more complete functionality. Windows XP includes &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;fsutil reparsepoint&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;. [[Windows NT 6.0]] and later operating systems include an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;mklink&amp;apos;&amp;apos; command-line utility for creating junction points.

==Examples of use==

===Program redirection===
By setting a junction point that points to a directory containing a particular version of a piece of software, it may be possible to add another version of the software and redirect the junction point to point to the version desired.

===Saving disk space===
Since the contents of a junction do not take up any space (they simply point to the original files in the original directory) if you need to have multiple points of entry to a large directory, junction points will serve that purpose well. Do not confuse junction points with a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;copy&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of something as it simply points to the original. If directories need to be modified separately a junction cannot be used as it does not provide a distinct copy of the directory or files within.

===Circumventing pre-defined paths===
Since reinstalling Windows (or installing a new version) often requires deleting the contents of the C: drive, it is advantageous to create multiple [[Disk partitioning|partition]]s so only one partition needs to be deleted during the installation. However, some programs don&amp;apos;t let the user choose the installation directory, or install some of their files to the C: drive even when they are installed to a different drive. By creating a junction point, the program can be tricked into installing to a different directory.

==Obtaining a list of junction points==
A list of all the junctions present in the current directory can be obtained from an elevated Command Prompt as Admin by executing &amp;quot;dir /aL&amp;quot;, and a list of all the junctions present on a disk volume, by executing &amp;quot;dir /aL /s C:\&amp;quot;, where &amp;quot;C:&amp;quot; is the volume to scan.

==Creating or deleting a junction point==
A junction point can be created in XP (after installing; Server2003 Resource Kit) with
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;LINKD Source Destination&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

To delete it in XP, use:
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;LINKD Source /D &amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

A junction point can be created in Vista or 7 with
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;mklink /J &amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

To delete it in Vista or 7, use:
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;fsutil reparsepoint delete PATH&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

==Limitations==
Junction points aren&amp;apos;t supported by [[Windows NT startup process|Windows boot]] [[Windows Vista startup process|process]], so it&amp;apos;s impossible to redirect certain system folders:
*folder containing hiberfil.sys (if it&amp;apos;s configured to be outside root directory)
*\Windows
*\Windows\System32
*\Windows\Config
However it is possible to redirect non-critical folders:
*\Users
*\Documents and Settings
*\Program Files
*\Program Files (x86)
