        text="&lt;p&gt;{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eiko Kadono&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|角野 栄子|Kadono Eiko}} {{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eiko Watanabe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|渡辺英子|Watanabe Eiko|born January 1, 1935}} is a [[Japanese author]] of [[children&amp;apos;s literature]], [[picture books]], non-fiction and essays in [[Shōwa period|Shōwa]] and [[Heisei period]] Japan.

==Biography==
Kadono was born in [[Tokyo]], and attended the Nihon Fukushi University in [[Aichi prefecture]], followed by a degree in [[English literature]] from [[Waseda University]].

After graduation in 1960 at the age of 25, she emigrated to [[Brazil]], where she spent two years. She wrote a nonfiction story called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Brazil and My Friend Luizinho&amp;apos;&amp;apos; based on her experience at that time, about a Brazilian boy who loves dancing [[samba]]. This was her maiden work, but it was not published until 1970.

Most of her works are books for children. Her first successful children&amp;apos;s book published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ôdorabô Bula Bula shi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [The Robber Bla-Bla] was published in 1981.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Encyclopedia of Children&amp;apos;slit&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first= Peter |last=Hunt|coauthors=Ray, Sheila G.

Both the novel and the film are known by the English title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Kiki&amp;apos;s Delivery Service]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The book was awarded the Noma Children’s Literature Award, and she followed on this success with four sequels in the same series.
