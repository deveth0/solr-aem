&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eijsden should not be confused with the village of [[Eisden]] in the Belgian province of Limburg.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
----

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eijsden&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Pronunciation|130 Eijsden.ogg}}) ({{lang-li|Èèsjde}}) is a place situated in the southern part of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]. Until January 1st, 2011 it was the main village in a municipality with the same name. On that date this municipality merged with a neighbouring one, which resulted in the new [[Eijsden-Margraten]] municipality.

Eijsden is one of the most southerly places in the Netherlands. For in its south the village is extending up to the border between the Netherlands and [[Belgium]]. On its west side the river [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] (named Maas in Dutch) forms the frontier between both mentioned countries.

==History==
Eijsden is one of the older places in the country. Its name is supposed to be derived of the Germanic word for aspen forest. Excavations have revealed a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] settlement. In the Middle Ages, this settlement developed to a village. After the (feudal) Middle Ages, in the seventeenth century Eijsden gained in economic strength because of its position near the Dutch-Belgian frontier on the Meuse river. Its function as a trading and shipping centre attracted settlement of well-to-do merchants from [[Holland]]. This period of prosperity ended in the Napoleonic era when, for a time, the area ceased to be a frontier.

===Former municipality===
The former Eijsden municipality was composed of several population centres, of which the one named Eijsden was the largest, with 7000 inhabitants.
The other population centres (now all part of &amp;quot;Eijsden-Margraten&amp;quot;) were:
*[[Gronsveld]]
*[[Mariadorp]]
*[[Mesch]]
*[[Oost-Maarland]]
*[[Rijckholt]]
*[[Withuis]]

==Economy==
Apart from trading and shipping, the Eijsden economy has had an agricultural character, with a focus on fruit growing. At one time, in Eijsden  the Netherland&amp;apos;s largest local fruit tree area was situated.
In 1870, a  [[Zinc oxide|zinc white]] factory brought industrial activity to the municipality, along with jobs and air pollution. The number of jobs originally was about 700; by now some 300 are left.
In the second half of the 20th century, many orchards were replaced by housing, dairy farming, industry and water (as a result of extended gravel extraction). Nowadays Eijsden is largely residential.

==Sights==
*The seventeenth century Renaissance style castle of Eijsden (according to the Unesco-list) is one of the top hundred buildings in the country.

==Music==
In the municipality of Eijsden two military bands are based (&amp;apos;the blue&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;the red&amp;apos;), of which the first mentioned belongs to the second highest national division and the last mentioned to the highest.

==Famous natives of Eijsden==
*[[Eugène Dubois]]- Anatomist/Anthropologist

*[[Jo Maas]], former cyclist, stage winner and seventh in end-classification of 1978 [[Tour de France]].
