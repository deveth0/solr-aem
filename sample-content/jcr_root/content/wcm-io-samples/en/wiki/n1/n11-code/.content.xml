An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;N11 code&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;N11 number&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (said as n-one-one) is a special [[abbreviated dialing]] [[telephone number]] within the [[North American Numbering Plan]], which allows access to special [[Service (economics)|service]]s.  Each of these eight numbers prevents 10,000 telephone numbers (from N11-0000 to N11-9999) from being used.  Only non-[[geographic]] [[area code]]s, such as [[toll-free telephone number|toll-free]] 800/888/877/866/855 numbers and [[900 number]]s may use N11 as the [[telephone exchange]] [[Telephone prefix|prefix]], since the area code must always be dialed for these numbers.

Usage is generally assigned as follows:
*[[2-1-1]]: [[community]] services, [[United Way of America|United Way]]
*[[3-1-1]]: [[municipal government]] services, non-emergency
*[[4-1-1]]: [[directory assistance]]
*[[5-1-1]]: [[traffic]] [[information]] or police non-emergency services
*[[6-1-1]]: [[telephone company|telephone company (telco)]] [[customer service]] and repair
*[[7-1-1]]: [[Telecommunications devices for the deaf|TDD]] [[Telecommunications Relay Service|relay]] for the [[deaf]]
*[[8-1-1]]: underground public [[utility location]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;See FCC Doc. [http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-257293A1.doc No. 92-105]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; in Canada 8-1-1 is assigned for non-emergency health information and services
*[[9-1-1]] emergency medical, police, or fire

9-1-1 and 4-1-1 work from nearly every telephone in the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]], while the others vary from place to place.  Generally, only 4-1-1 calls incur a fee.  9-1-1 access is mandated by [[law]], even on lines with no service (a &amp;quot;soft&amp;quot; [[dial tone]]).  6-1-1 (formerly 8-1-1) may also be accessible to activate service on such lines, and 3-1-1 may be available as well for urgent (but non-emergency) calls to [[police]], or any call to local government in some places.

Other community services are provided through 2-1-1, but only if a [[non-profit]] organization such as the [[United Way of America|United Way]] operates it locally.  Likewise, local or state/provincial government may or may not operate traffic information through 5-1-1.  8-1-1 was made mandatory in the U.S. in 2007, as is 7-1-1.  Unlike 9-1-1, these may or may not be available on a phone without paid service.

[[0-1-1]] followed by a [[country code]] is used to dial internationally, but this use is not considered an N11 code. 1-1-1 is not available in the NANP, because 11 is the prefix used to access [[vertical service code]]s from [[rotary phone]]s, and is essentially meaningless to the system otherwise.
