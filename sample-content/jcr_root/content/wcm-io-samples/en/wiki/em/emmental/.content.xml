The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Emmental&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a region in west central [[Switzerland]], forming part of the canton of [[Bern (canton)|Bern]]. It is a hilly landscape comprising the basins of the [[Emme (river)|Emme]] and [[Ilfis]] rivers. The region is mostly devoted to farming, particularly dairy farming. Its notable cities are [[Burgdorf, Switzerland|Burgdorf]] and [[Langnau im Emmental|Langnau]].

Comprising the  [[districts of Switzerland|district]]s of [[Burgdorf (district)|Burgdorf]], [[Trachselwald (district)|Trachselwald]] and [[Signau (district)|Signau]] of the [[canton of Berne]], the Emmental became part of the administrative &amp;apos;&amp;apos;region&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Emmental-Oberaargau]] on 1 January 2010. The district of [[Fraubrunnen (district)|Fraubrunnen]] is divided between Emmental and [[Bern-Mittelland]].

==Geography==
{{see|Bernese Mittelland|Swiss Plateau}}
The region comprises relatively low mountains on the right bank of the [[Aare River]] . It includes the basins of the Emme and the [[Ilfis]] between Burgdorf and the boundary with the canton of [[Solothurn (canton)|Solothurn]].

The landscape is dominated by meadows and pastureland, with forest interspersed.

==Economy==
The original [[Emmental cheese]] is produced there, and the dairy industry still dominates the local economy. Pottery from the region is also prized, and the ceramics of the region have endured practically unchanged since the 17th century.

Tourism has had less impact on the region than on other parts of Switzerland.

==Culture==

The novelist [[Jeremias Gotthelf]] (1797-1854) was a pastor in the Emmental and wrote about the region.

The Emmental also played a dominant role in the history of the [[Mennonites]].

===Architecture===
The typical Emmental farmhouse has a steep roof with a large [[Overhang (architecture)|overhang]] that almost reaches the ground.
