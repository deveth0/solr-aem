&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Emission&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; may refer to:
* [[Flue gas]], also:
** [[Exhaust gas]], flue gas occurring as a result of the combustion of a fuel
* Emission of [[Air pollution|air pollutant]]s
* [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|Emission of greenhouse gases]], a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range
* [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)]], the process by which the energy of a photon is released by another entity
* [[Emission (radiocommunications)]], the radio signal (usually modulated) emitted from a radio transmitter
* [[Emission coefficient]], a coefficient in the power output per unit time of an electromagnetic source
* [[Emission factor]]
* [[Emission line]], or &amp;quot;spectral line&amp;quot;, a dark or bright line in an otherwise uniform and continuous spectrum
* [[Emission nebula]], a cloud of ionized gas emitting light of various colors
* [[Emission spectroscopy]], photoemission spectroscopy, flame emission spectroscopy and other types of spectroscopy
* [[Emission standard]], requirements that set specific limits to the amount of pollutants that can be released into the environment
* [[Emission theory]], a competing theory for the special theory of relativity, explaining the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment
* [[Emission theory (vision)]], the proposal that visual perception is accomplished by rays of light emitted by the eyes
* [[Emissions trading]], a market-based approach used to control pollution by providing economic incentives for achieving reductions in the emissions of pollutants
* [[Ejaculation]], the ejecting of semen from the penis; also, specifically:
** [[Nocturnal emission]], ejaculation experienced during sleep
* [[Light emission]]
* [[Thermionic emission]], the flow of charged particles called thermions from a charged metal or a charged metal oxide surface, archaically known as the Edison effect
* Noise emission; see [[Noise]]
* [[Exhalation]], especially where the velocity of exhaled air can influence the harmonic generating properties of a vibrating body, such as the reed of a musical instrument like the saxophone
