&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Emma Verona Johnston&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (née &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Calhoun&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (August 6, 1890 – December 1, 2004) was an [[United States|American]] [[supercentenarian]] recognized as the &amp;quot;oldest living American&amp;quot; from May 2004 until her death at age 114 years. Verona was born in [[Indianola, Iowa]] as one of a large family. She was the oldest living graduate of [[Drake University]], where she was a member of the Class of 1912.

At age 98, she moved from [[Iowa]] to [[Ohio]] in order to live with her daughter and son-in-law. She continued to be in good health even when she attained supercentenarian status, able to walk up steps and alert and able to engage in conversations.

By March 2004, she became the fifth-oldest documented person in the world and second-oldest documented in the United States, but still not the [[oldest people|oldest person]] in the state of Ohio, since that state was also home to [[Charlotte Benkner]].

Benkner&amp;apos;s death in May 2004 left Johnston [[list of the verified oldest people|the oldest documented person]] in the United States, and that of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[Ramona Trinidad Iglesias-Jordan]] later that month left her third-oldest recognized person in the world. She died in [[Worthington, Ohio]].
