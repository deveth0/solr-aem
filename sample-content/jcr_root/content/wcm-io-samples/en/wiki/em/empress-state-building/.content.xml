The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Empress State Building&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a skyscraper on the [[West Brompton]]/[[Earl&amp;apos;s Court]] border in the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]]. It was built in 1961 and was {{convert|100|m|ft|0}} tall with 28 floors, designed by Stone, Toms &amp;amp; Partners. It was renovated in 2003 to a design by [[Wilkinson Eyre|Wilkinson Eyre Architects]]. Three floors and {{convert|17.3|m|ft|0}} were added to its height. &amp;apos;Orbit&amp;apos; is the name given to the private revolving bar on the top floor which offers panoramic views of London.

The building is named after the [[Empress Hall]] which formerly stood on the site, and in tribute to the [[Empire State Building]].

The building is occupied by staff from the [[Metropolitan Police Service]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |title=Earls Court redevelopment: grasping the scale |author=Dave Hill |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/davehillblog/2011/apr/01/earls-court-project-masterplan-exhibition |publisher=The Guardian |date=1 April 2011 |accessdate=4 December 2011|quote=Empress State Building next to Earls Court 2 (currently given over to police business that entrance security staff won&amp;apos;t specify)}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; who refer to it as ESB&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Student placement year with the Performance Directorate|publisher=Metropolitan Police|url=http://www.met.police.uk/pdstudents/location.htm|quote=ESB is also within an easy walking distance of Earls Court underground station}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;. Some of the upper floors were occupied by staff from [[Transport for London]] until 2010.

This building was originally designed as a hotel but was first used by the [[Admiralty]] and [[GCHQ]].
The Directorate of Naval Shore Telecommunications (formerly the Naval Shore Telecommunications Authority) had their National HQ office here in the 80&amp;apos;s &amp;amp; 90&amp;apos;s.
