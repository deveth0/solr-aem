&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;XO sauce&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a spicy [[seafood]] [[sauce]] that originated from [[Hong Kong]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book | last=Vos | first=Heidemarie | title=Passion of a Foodie | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-934925-63-8 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=spY3ct9PBxEC&amp;amp;pg=PA591 | page=591}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is commonly used in [[Chinese cuisine]], most notably in southern Chinese regions like [[Guangdong]] province.

==History==
Developed in the [[1980s in Hong Kong|1980s]] in [[Hong Kong]] for [[Cantonese cuisine]], it is made of roughly chopped dried seafoods, including scallops, dried fish and shrimp, and subsequently cooked with chili peppers, onions, and garlic. Spring Moon, [[the Peninsula Hong Kong]]&amp;apos;s Chinese restaurant is often credited with the invention of XO sauce, although others claim the sauce&amp;apos;s origin in the urban area of [[Kowloon]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://gourmettraveller.com.au/xo-sauce.htm |title=XO sauce |publisher=http://gourmettraveller.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Etymology==
The name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;XO sauce&amp;apos;&amp;apos; comes from fine XO (extra-old) [[Cognac (drink)|cognac]], which is a popular Western [[liquor]] in Hong Kong and considered by many to be a chic product there. In addition the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;XO&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is often used in the popular culture of Hong Kong to denote high quality, prestige, and luxury. In fact, XO sauce has been marketed in the same manner as the French liquor, using packaging of similar colour schemes.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://info.vogue.com.cn/food-wine/20100125/2878.html Vogue China: XO sauce]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In [[Hong Kong English]], XO is pronounced exactly the same.

==Uses==
XO sauce can be used as a condiment on the side of main dishes or used in cooking to enhance the flavour of fish, meats, vegetables, and otherwise bland foods such as [[tofu]] or [[Chinese noodles|noodles]]. Home cooks often use this sauce as the chief flavorant for fried rice.

==Ingredients==
