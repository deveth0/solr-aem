        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;very high-level programming language&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (VHLL) is a [[programming language]] with a very high level of [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], used primarily as a professional programmer productivity tool.

Very high-level programming languages are usually limited to a very specific application, purpose, or type of task. For this reason, very high-level programming languages are often referred to as goal-oriented programming languages.

An example of a very high-level programming language is the [[mIRC scripting language]], which is designed to extend [[mIRC]], a popular [[IRC client]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].
