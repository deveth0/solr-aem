        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vesper George School of Art&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[USA]], closed in 1983.
For many years the school contributed to the Boston art community, training many talented artists, many of whom are still active in both commercial art and fine arts. In addition to training artists, it served to allow many artists to maintain a living as instructors while they were building their careers.
