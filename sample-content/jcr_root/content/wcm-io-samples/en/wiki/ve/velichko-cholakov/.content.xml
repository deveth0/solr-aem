&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Velichko Cholakov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-bg|Величко Чолаков}}, born January 12, 1982 in [[Smolyan]]) is an ethnically [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] [[Azerbaijan]]i [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifter]].&amp;lt;ref name=london&amp;gt;[http://www.london2012.com/athlete/cholakov-velichko-1060068 Velichko Cholakov profile at the 2012 Summer Olympics official site]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He competed in the over 105&amp;amp;nbsp;kg class at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], his first Olympics, winning an Olympic bronze medal. After missing two [[clean and jerk]] attempts at 245&amp;amp;nbsp;kg, he managed to lift a total of 447.5&amp;amp;nbsp;kg, placing him behind [[Latvia|Latvia&amp;apos;s]] [[Viktors Ščerbatihs]] and [[Iran|Iran&amp;apos;s]] [[Hossein Reza Zadeh]].

Velichko won the European weightlifting title in [[Kiev, Ukraine]] in 2004, and finished second at the World championship in [[Vancouver]] in 2003. In 2002, he won gold medals at both the European and World Youth Weightlifting championships.

He is also 2.05 meters tall, this makes lifting more difficult both in regard to distance of elevation and less than ideal limb proportions.

Cholakov tested positive for a [[steroid]] in 2008 during an out-of-competition test, along with ten other weightlifters, and therefore Bulgaria&amp;apos;s weightlifting federation withdrew its team from the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. Apart from Cholakov the athletes who tested positive were [[Ivailo Filev]], [[Alan Tsagaev]], [[Mehmed Fikretov]], [[Ivan Stoitsov]], [[Ivan Markov (weightlifter)|Ivan Markov]], [[Georgi Markov (weightlifter)|Georgi Markov]], [[Demir Demirev]], [[Milka Maneva]], [[Donka Mincheva]] and [[Gergana Kirilova]].
