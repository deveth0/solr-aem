==History==
Vetlanda was still nothing more than a village for several centuries. With the 1840s population boom in Småland, and the industrial revolution winning grounds in Sweden, the industry expanded and people settled in the village. With the railways crossing Vetlanda in the late 19th century the population further blossomed, and Vetlanda got the title of a [[cities in Sweden|city]] on New Year&amp;apos;s Day 1920, at which time its population amounted to 3,015.

The [[coat of arms]] was selected as an ear of wheat, a derivation of the arms for the old jurisdiction [[Östra Härad]], wherein &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vitala&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was rumoured to have been the centre, that depicted three ears of [[wheat]]. The present spelling &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vetlanda&amp;apos;&amp;apos; did not come into use until the 1920s, before that it was known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hvetlanda&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a form that can be found in several companies and organizations.

In the 19th century, wood [[industry]] got a stronghold in Vetlanda, a seat it still has today. Manufacturing is large in Vetlanda, besides wood industries there are also a strong metal industries and other factories.

==Sport==
Vetlanda also has two sports teams that compete in the highest league in their sports, Elit Vetlanda [[Speedway]] and [[Vetlanda BK|Vetlanda bandyklubb]]. VBK has won the [[List of Swedish bandy champions|Swedish bandy championship]] three times, 1986, 1991 and 1992 and [[European Cup (bandy)|European Cup]] once, 1991.

In 2013 the B-pool of the [[Bandy World Championships]] will be played in Vetlanda.[http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;sl=sv&amp;amp;u=http://iof1.idrottonline.se/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Bandynyheter/Senastenytt/VetlandarustarforVM/&amp;amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://iof1.idrottonline.se/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Bandynyheter/Senastenytt/VetlandarustarforVM/%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1024%26bih%3D545%26prmd%3Dimvns&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=NOmLULSYAqqj4gTrzICQCw&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=0CCEQ7gEwAA]
