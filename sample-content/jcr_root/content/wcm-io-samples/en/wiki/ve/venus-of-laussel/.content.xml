[[File:Venus-de-Laussel-detail-bras.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Detail of the left arm and hand.]]The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Venus of Laussel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Venus figurines|Venus figurine]], a 1.5 foot high [[limestone]] [[bas-relief]] of a nude female figure, painted with red [[ochre]]. It was carved into a large block of fallen limestone in a rock shelter (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;abri de Laussel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[:fr:Abri de Cap Blanc]]) in the commune of [[Marquay, Dordogne|Marquay]], in the [[Dordogne]] department of southwestern [[France]]. The carving is associated with the [[Gravettian]] [[Upper Paleolithic]] culture (approximately 25,000 years old). It is currently displayed in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Musée d&amp;apos;Aquitaine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Bordeaux]], France.

==Description==
The figure holds a [[wisent]] horn, or possibly a [[cornucopia]], in one hand, which has 13 notches. According to some researchers, this may symbolize the number of moons or the number of [[menstrual cycle]]s in one year.

[[Alexander Marshack]] said about the Venus of Laussel that &amp;quot;One cannot conjecture on the basis of one engraved sequence any meaning to the marks, but that the unusually clean horn was notated with storied marks is clear.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Marshack, p. 335.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

She has her hand on her abdomen (or womb), with large [[breast]]s and [[vulva]]. There is a &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; on her thigh and her faceless head is turned toward the horn.

==Discovery and display==
The figure was discovered in 1911 by [[Jean-Gaston Lalanne|J. G. Lalanne]], a physician. It was carved into large block of limestone in a rock shelter (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;abri de Laussel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) at the commune of [[Marquay, Dordogne|Marquay]] in the [[Dordogne]] department of southwestern [[France]]. It is now in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Musée d&amp;apos;Aquitaine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Bordeaux]], France.
