Vera Chatzman was born in the town of [[Rostov]], [[Russia]], the daughter of Isaiah and Feodosia Chatzman. She initially studied music before taking up medical training in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.semp.us/publications/biot_reader.php?BiotID=406 SEMP: Evidence-based disaster management: preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; There she met Chaim Weizmann at the University&amp;apos;s Zionist Club.

She married Chaim Weizmann at [[Zoppot]], Germany, in 1906; they had two sons, Benjamin born in 1907, and Michael born in 1916. The Weizmann family lived in [[Manchester]], [[England]], for thirty years (1906–1937). In 1913, Vera Weizmann received her English medical license and worked as a doctor in the [[public health]] service at clinics for infants, developing advanced techniques for infant supervision and nutrition.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/weizmann-vera Jewish Women Encyclopedia, Vera Weizmann]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The Weizmanns’ younger son, Michael, served as a pilot in the British [[Royal Air Force]] during [[World War II]] and was killed when his plane was shot down over the [[Bay of Biscay]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/weizmann-vera Jewish Women Encyclopedia, Vera Weizmann]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1916, Weizmann gave up her work as a [[pediatrician]] when she joined her husband upon his appointment as the scientific adviser in [[chemistry]] to the [[British Admiralty]] during [[World War I]]. In 1920, Weizmann was among the founding members of [[Women&amp;apos;s International Zionist Organization]] (WIZO), and served as its president, alternating with Lady Sieff, for forty years. When [[World War II]] began, she devoted all of her efforts to [[Youth Aliyah]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aliyat Hanoar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), an organization that she established in England and continued to head in Israel as honorary president.

During [[1948 Arab-Israeli War|Israel&amp;apos;s War of Independence]], Weizmann focused on the treatment and rehabilitation of wounded soldiers. Immediately after the war, she established the Association of the War of Independence Handicapped Veterans and served as its president. She also established two centers for the rehabilitation of wounded soldiers, Beit Kay in [[Nahariya]] and the Department of Rehabilitation at Sheba&amp;amp;mdash;[[Tel Hashomer Hospital]].

In addition to her activity in these organizations, Weizmann gave her support to many voluntary organizations such as [[Israel InterUniversity Computation Center|ILAN]], [[Magen David Adom]], for which she served as President, and dozens of other private and institutional [[Charitable organization|charitable]] endeavors.

==Weizmann House==
As [[first lady]], Weizmann insisted on designing the interior of the [[Weizmann House|house]] built for the couple at [[Weizmann Institute]]—to the dismay of the architect. All the furniture and art were originals, most of them imported from England or France.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/site/en/weizman.asp?pi=457&amp;amp;doc_id=2833&amp;amp;date=0 Weizmann House, [[Weizmann Institute]]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
