&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vengara&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a village in [[Kannur District]], [[Kerala]], [[India]] that is known for its landscapes and lush greenery.
The village is between the [[Arabian Sea]] and [[Ezhimala Hill]].

The word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;vengara&amp;apos;&amp;apos; comes from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ven kara&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  meaning &amp;quot;white land&amp;quot; created by moving sea.  This village is surrounded by [[Kannur|Kannur town]], [[Taliparamba]] and [[Payyanur]].

Protected by Ezhimala and Madaippara, the Village Vengara has witnessed many historical events. Ezhimala was the Capital of ancient Ezhimala Kingdom and now this place the Head Quarters of the proposed Naval Academy (The biggest one in its kind in Asia). The history reveals that Tipu Sultan, the Lion of Mysor has passed through this place during his battle forward to Kerala. He attacked ‘Madaikkavu’ and ‘Vadukunda Temples’ located on nearby hill Madayippara, for the sole object of looting the enormous wealth kept in those places. Still the remains of a fort belongs to Tipu lying on Madayippara. He made a canal between Payangadi River and Moolakkeel River, called ‘Sultan Thodu’ (Sultan Canal) for the easy movement of cargo. Now, this canal has an important role to do with the proposed ‘Malabar Tourism Promotion Program.’ Historians say that once this place was a part of Arabian Sea hundreds of years ago. When the sea withdrew at last, there remained sandy land which people called ‘Ven Kara’ (White land in local tongue). Later ‘Ven Kara’ became Vengara by use.

==Sree Muchilot Kavu , Vengara==
Vengara , a village near Payayangadi enters into the tourism map of Kerala as a result of the proposed Perumkaliyattam at Sree Muchilot Kavu in January 2009.  describes how the Perumkaliyattams becomes a festival of the people irrespective of caste, class, creed or religion. The perumkaliyattam consistes of several customs and rituals like Varachuvekkal, kalnattu karmam, kalavara niraykkal, upadevadha theyyattams, vellattam and then the thirumudi nivaral of Muchilot Bagavathi. As prasadam feast is organised in a grand manner by giving food to more than a lakh devotees. It symbolises the marriage of Muchilottamma.
