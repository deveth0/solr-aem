The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;veiling-glare laser&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a proposed [[Dazzler (weapon)|laser dazzler]], a [[Non-lethal force|non-lethal weapon]] which would use light in the [[ultraviolet]] (UV) range. The intended effect would be to cause [[fluorescence]] in the [[lens (anatomy)|lens of the eye]], producing intense [[light pollution#Glare|glare]] and making clear vision impossible. In September 2002, the [[Joint Nonlethal Weapons Directorate]] announced the proposal was under development.

It is intended to have three key advantages over previous laser dazzlers which operate in visible wavelengths:
* the power levels used can be lower, so there is in theory less risk of eye damage;
* the location of the laser is not apparent to the target; and
* it has a wide angle of effectiveness.

However, the proposal has been seriously questioned. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[New Scientist]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; quoted two experts, Tom van den Berg of the [[Netherlands]] Ophthalmic Research Institute and Bill Stark of [[Saint Louis University]], as suggesting that at the requisite power levels the use of UV wavelengths is in itself questionable and could damage the lens, almost definitely causing [[cataract]]s.

In addition Professor Stark (an expert in the effects of UV light on eyes) questioned whether the idea could work at all: &amp;quot;My experience suggests that such fluorescence does not cause significant amounts of glare.&amp;quot;
