&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vementry&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Old Norse: &amp;quot;Vemunðarey&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=saga/&amp;gt;) is an uninhabited [[island]] in [[Shetland]], [[Scotland]], on the north side of the West Mainland, lying south of [[Muckle Roe]].

The island is known for its well-preserved [[chambered cairn]], and the two [[First World War]] [[gun]] emplacements which overlook the narrow entrance into the former [[naval]] [[anchor]]age of [[Busta Voe]].

The island was last inhabited in the 1840s, and is now the largest uninhabited island of Shetland.

Vementry is also the name of a small [[farm]] on [[Mainland, Shetland]], immediately south of the island.  For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as the &amp;quot;Isle of Vementry&amp;quot;. There is no [[ferry]] service to the island, although the shepherd on the mainland farm occasionally makes the short trip to work with stock on the island.

The Isle of Vementry is separated from the mainland Vementry by a narrow channel or &amp;quot;[[Sound (geography)|sound]]&amp;quot;, consisting of Uyea Sound to the east and Cribba Sound to the west. Cribba Sound is famed for the quality of [[mussels]] produced at the mussel farms located there.
