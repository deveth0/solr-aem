The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vector W2&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[concept car]] created by [[Vector Motors]] in 1980. It has a twin-turbocharged 350 [[cubic inch displacement|cid]] (5.7 L) Donovan V8 engine that produced over 600&amp;amp;nbsp;hp (450&amp;amp;nbsp;kW) and over 600&amp;amp;nbsp;ft·lbf (800&amp;amp;nbsp;N·m) of torque. The top speed was a claimed 242&amp;amp;nbsp;mph (389&amp;amp;nbsp;km/h).

The name comes from the &amp;quot;W&amp;quot; for [[Jerry Wiegert]] (designer and founder of Vector) and &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; for the number of turbos. Even though this car was a [[prototype]], the car was repainted to verify different paint schemes prior to production and was photographed by many magazines after being repainted several different colors.  Between 1982 and 1987, Wiegert attempted to raise the money to start production of his car. In its lifetime, the car has covered over {{Convert|100000|mi|km}} in testing, more than any other [[concept car]]. In 1989, a modified version of the W2 went in production as the [[Vector W8]].

Currently, the Vector W2 prototype is owned by Wiegert. The car is currently dismantled, and stored alongside other Vector equipment in the current Vector headquarters in Wilmington, California.

==Notes==
A Vector W2 was used in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Remington Steele]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; episode &amp;quot;[[License to Steele]]&amp;quot;; portrayed as the product of a fictional car company, it was called the Hunter Jet Star 6000.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{imdb episode|0684855|License to Steele}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
