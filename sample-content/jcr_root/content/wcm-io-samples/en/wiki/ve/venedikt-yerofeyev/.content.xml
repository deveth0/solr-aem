&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Venedict Vasilyevich Yerofeyev&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Erofeev&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Erofeyev&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Венеди́кт Васи́льевич Ерофе́ев}}) (24 October 1938 – 11 May 1990) was a [[Russia]]n writer.

==Biography==
Yerofeyev was born in the small settlement [[Niva-2]], a suburb of [[Kandalaksha]], [[Murmansk Oblast]]. His father was imprisoned during [[Great Purge|Stalin&amp;apos;s purges]] but survived 16 years in the [[gulags]]. Most of Yerofeyev&amp;apos;s childhood was spent in [[Kirovsk, Murmansk Oblast]]. He managed to enter the philology department of the [[Moscow State University]] but was [[Expulsion (academia)|expelled]] from the University after a year and a half because he did not attend compulsory military training. Later he studied in several more [[institute]]s in different towns, including [[Kolomna]] and [[Vladimir]], but he never managed to graduate from any, usually being expelled due to his &amp;quot;amoral behaviour&amp;quot; ([[freethinking]]). Between 1958 and 1975, Yerofeyev lived without [[propiska in the Soviet Union|propiska]] in various towns in Russia, [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and [[Lithuania]], also spending some time in [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tadjikistan]], doing different low-level and underpaid jobs; for a time he lived and worked in the [[Muromtsev Dacha]] in Moscow. He started writing at the age of 17; in the 1960s he unsuccessfully submitted several articles on [[Ibsen]] and [[Hamsun]] to literary magazines.

==Literary legacy==
Yerofeyev is best known for his 1969 poem in prose &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Moscow-Petushki]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (several English translations exist, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Moscow to the End of the Line&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Moscow Stations&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). It is an  account of a journey from [[Moscow]] to [[Petushki]] ([[Vladimir Oblast]]) by train, a journey soaked in alcohol. During the trip, the hero recounts some of the fantastic escapades he participated in, including declaring war on [[Norway]], charting the drinking habits of his colleagues when leader of a cable-laying crew, and obsessing about the woman he loves. Referred to by [[David Remnick]] as &amp;quot;the comic high-water mark of the Brezhnev era&amp;quot;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | date=2008-12-02 | publisher=[[Village Voice]] |title= Susan Orlean, David Remnick, Ethan Hawke, and Others Pick Their Favorite Obscure Books | url =http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-12-03/books/susan-orlean-david-remnick-ethan-hawke-and-others-pick-their-favorite-obscure-books/}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; the poem was published for the first time in 1973 in [[Jerusalem]] immediately making Yerofeyev famous throughout the world. It was not published in the [[Soviet Union]] until 1989.

Of note is his smaller 1988 work, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;My Little Leniniana&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Моя  маленькая  лениниана, Moya malenkaya Leniniana), which is a collection of quotations from [[Vladimir Ilyich Lenin|Lenin]]&amp;apos;s works and letters, which shows the unpleasant parts of the character of the &amp;quot;leader of the proletariat&amp;quot;.

Yerofeyev also claimed to have written in 1972 a novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shostakovich&amp;apos;&amp;apos; about the famous Russian composer [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], but the manuscript was allegedly stolen in a train. The novel has never been found. Before his death of throat [[cancer]] Yerofeyev finished a play called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Walpurgisnacht, or the Steps of the Commander&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Вальпургиева ночь или Шаги командора&amp;quot;) and was working on another play about [[Fanny Kaplan]].
