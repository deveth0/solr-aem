&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vela&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky. Its name is [[Latin]] for the [[sail]]s of a ship, and it was originally part of a larger constellation, the ship &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Argo Navis]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was later divided into three parts, the others being [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] and [[Puppis]].

==Notable features==
Argo was sub-divided in 1752 by the French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]], forming Vela. Despite the division, Lacaille kept Argo&amp;apos;s [[Bayer designation]]s. Therefore Carina has the α, β and ε, Vela has γ and δ, Puppis has ζ, and so on.

===Stars===
The brightest star in the constellation, [[Gamma Velorum|γ Velorum]], is a [[apparent magnitude|bright]] 1.75&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;m&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; [[supergiant]] star. The star is actually [[star system|quintuple]], and the primary component is famous for being the brightest [[Wolf–Rayet star]] in the sky. γ Velorum is also sometimes called Regor.

[[Kappa Velorum|κ Velorum]] is also called Markeb.

===Brown dwarfs===

The discovery of a binary [[brown dwarf]] system named [[WISE  1049-5319]] only 6.6 light years away, the third closest system to [[Solar system|Sol]], was announced on 11 March 2013.

===False Cross===&amp;lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Crux]] --&amp;gt;
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;False Cross&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] formed of the [[star]]s [[Delta Velorum|δ Velorum]] and [[Kappa Velorum|κ Velorum]] and [[Iota Carinae|ι Carinae]] and [[Epsilon Carinae|ε Carinae]]. It is so called because it is sometimes mistaken for the [[Crux|Southern Cross]], causing errors in [[astronavigation]].

===Deep-sky objects===
Of the deep-sky objects of interest in Vela is a [[planetary nebula]] known as the [[NGC 3132]] (nicknamed Eight-burst Nebula). This constellation has 32 more [[planetary nebula]]e.

Also of interest is the [[Vela Supernova Remnant]].  This is the [[nebula]] of a [[supernova]] explosion that is believed to have been visible from Earth around 10,000 years ago.  The remnant contains the [[Vela Pulsar]], the first [[pulsar]] to be identified optically.

The [[Gum Nebula]] is a faint emission nebula, believed to be the remains of a million-year-old supernova.

Vela is called out in NASA&amp;apos;s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) for 5 September 2011.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110905.html &amp;quot;HH 47: A Young Star Jet Expands&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[NGC 2670]] is an [[open cluster]] located in Vela. It has an overall magnitude of 7.8 and is 3200 light-years from Earth. The stars of NGC 2670, a Trumpler class II 2 p and Shapley class d cluster, are in a conformation suggesting a bow and arrow. Its class indicates that it is a poor, loose cluster, though detached from the star field. It is somewhat concentrated at its center, and its less than 50 stars range moderately in brightness.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=87}}
