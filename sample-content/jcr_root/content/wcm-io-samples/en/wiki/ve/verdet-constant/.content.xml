The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Verdet constant&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[optical]] &amp;quot;constant&amp;quot; that describes the strength of the [[Faraday effect]] for a particular material.

The Verdet constant for most materials is extremely small and is [[wavelength]] dependent.  It is strongest in substances containing [[paramagnetic]] [[ion]]s such as [[terbium]]. The highest Verdet constants are found in terbium [[Doping (Semiconductors)|doped]] dense flint glasses or in [[crystal]]s of [[terbium gallium garnet]] (TGG). This material has excellent [[Transparency (optics)|transparency]] properties and is very resistant to [[laser]] damage.

The Faraday effect is chromatic (i.e. it depends on wavelength) and therefore the Verdet constant is quite a strong function of wavelength. At 632.8&amp;amp;nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]], the Verdet constant for TGG is reported to be -134&amp;amp;nbsp;[[radian|rad]]/[[tesla (unit)|T]]·m, whereas at 1064&amp;amp;nbsp;nm it falls to -40&amp;amp;nbsp;rad/T·m.  This behavior means that the devices manufactured with a certain degree of rotation at one wavelength, will produce much less rotation at longer wavelengths.  Many [[Faraday rotator]]s and [[Faraday isolator|isolators]] are adjustable by varying the degree to which the active TGG rod is inserted into the [[magnetic field]] of the device.  In this way, the device can be tuned for use with a range of lasers within the design range of the device. Truly [[broadband]] sources (such as ultra-short [[pulse laser]]s and the tunable [[vibronic laser]]s) will not see the same rotation across the whole wavelength band.

The Verdet constant is named after the French physicist [[Émile Verdet]].
