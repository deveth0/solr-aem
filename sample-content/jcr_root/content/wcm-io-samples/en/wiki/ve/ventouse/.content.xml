&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ventouse&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[vacuum]] device used to assist the delivery of a [[baby]] when the second stage of [[childbirth|labour]] has not progressed adequately.  It is an alternative to a [[forceps in childbirth|forceps delivery]] and [[caesarean section]].  It cannot be used when the baby is in the [[breech birth|breech position]] or for [[premature birth]]s.  This technique is also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;vacuum extraction&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (VE).  The use of VE is generally safe, but it can occasionally have negative effects on either the mother and the child.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3389.htm eMedicine - Vacuum Extraction : Article by Christian S Pope, DO] Retrieved December 16, 2006&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Technique==

The woman is placed in the [[lithotomy position]] and assists throughout the process by pushing.  A [[suction]] cup is placed onto the head of the baby and the suction draws the skin from the scalp into the cup. Correct placement of the cup directly over the [[flexion point]], about 3&amp;amp;nbsp;cm anterior from the occipital (posterior) [[fontanelle]], is critical to the success of a VE.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Vacca|first=Aldo|title=Handbook of Vacuum Extraction in Obstetric Practice, 3rd edition|year=2009|publisher=Vacca Research|isbn=978-1-920818-03-6}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Ventouse devices have handles to allow for traction.  When the baby&amp;apos;s head is delivered, the device is detached, allowing the accoucheur and the mother to complete the delivery of the baby.

For proper use of the ventouse, the maternal cervix has to be fully dilated, the head engaged in the birth canal, and the head position known. If the ventouse attempt fails, it may be necessary to deliver the infant by [[forceps]] or [[caesarean section]].

===Indications for use of vacuum===

There are several indications to use a ventouse to aid delivery:
*Maternal exhaustion
*Prolonged second stage of labor
*Foetal distress in the second stage of labor, generally indicated by changes in the foetal heart-rate (usually measured on a [[cardiotocography|CTG]])
*Maternal illness where prolonged &amp;quot;bearing down&amp;quot; or pushing efforts would be risky (e.g. cardiac conditions, blood pressure, aneurysm, glaucoma). If these conditions are known about before the birth, or are severe, then an elective [[caesarean section]] may be performed.

==Comparisons to other forms of assisted delivery==
===Positive aspects===
* An [[episiotomy]] may not be required.
* The mother still takes an active role in the birth.
* No special [[anesthesia]] is required.
* The force applied to the baby can be less than that of a forceps delivery, and leaves no marks on the face.
* There is less potential for maternal trauma compared to forceps and caesarean section.

===Negative aspects===
*The baby will be left with a temporary lump on its head, known as a [[chignon (medical term)|chignon]].
*There is a possibility of [[cephalohematoma]] formation, or subgaleal hemorrhage.
