&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ventersburg&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small town in the [[Lejweleputswa District Municipality]] of the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] province in [[South Africa]]. It was established on the farm Kromfontein which was owned by PA Venter who died in [[1857 in South Africa|1857]]. His son allowed a Reform Church to be established on the farm in [[1864 in South Africa|1864]] and by [[1871 in South Africa|1871]], the first plots of the original farm were sold. Ventersburg was declared on 6 May 1873. The Dutch Reform Church was built in Ventersburg in [[1891 in South Africa|1891]]  but it was burnt down in [[1900 in South Africa|1900]] by the British forces during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]]. The church was later re-built in [[1912 in South Africa|1912]]. Municipality was also burnt down by the British forces during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]]. Is located 148.09 kilometers from Bloemfontein (Capital City of the Free State).

In [[1903 in South Africa|1903]], Ventersburg became a municipality but on the 5 December 2000 it was incorporated into the [[Matjhabeng Local Municipality]] along with the city of [[Welkom]] and the towns of [[Allanridge]], [[Hennenman]], [[Odendaalsrus]], and [[Virginia, Free State|Virginia]].

During the [[apartheid]] era, black people were forced to live outside Ventersburg in the location of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mamahabane&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The location has expanded into two districts, the second is Tswelangpele.
