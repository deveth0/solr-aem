        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Verdaccio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[Italian language|Italian]] name for the mixture of black, white, and yellow pigments resulting in a grayish or yellowish (depending on the proportion) soft greenish brown.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Verdaccio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; became an integral part of [[fresco painting]], in which this color is used for defining tonal values, forming a complete monochromatic [[underpainting]]. Often architectural details in frescoes are left in verdaccio without any additional color layers; a notable example is the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]], where verdaccio underpainting can be clearly seen, left as is on all architectural details of the composition.

In oil painting, a similar technique is used by [[Flemish painters]], referred to as the &amp;quot;dead layer,&amp;quot; is applied over the traditional bone colour (1 part raw umber to 1 part yellow ochre) priming to refine the values and remove the warm tone of the primer. The resulting &amp;quot;white to olive green to black&amp;quot; underpainting is &amp;quot;like being illuminated by moonlight.&amp;quot; It does not affect the tonality of the final painting.
