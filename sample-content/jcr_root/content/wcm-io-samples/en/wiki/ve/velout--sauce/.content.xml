A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;velouté sauce&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, pronounced {{IPA-fr|və.lu&amp;apos;te}}, along with [[Tomato sauce|tomato]], [[Hollandaise]], [[Béchamel]] and [[Espagnole sauce|espagnole]], is one of the sauces of [[French cuisine]] that were designated the  [[Sauce#French_cuisine|five &amp;quot;mother sauces&amp;quot;]]  by [[Auguste Escoffier]] in the 19th century, which was a simplification of the &amp;quot;Sauce Carême&amp;quot; list of [[Marie-Antoine Carême]]. The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;velouté&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is from the French adjectival form of  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;velour&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, meaning [[velvet]].

In preparing a velouté sauce, a light [[stock (food)|stock]] (one in which the bones used have not been previously roasted), such as chicken or fish stock, is thickened with a blond [[roux]]. Thus the ingredients of a velouté are equal parts by mass butter and flour to form the roux, a light chicken or fish stock, and salt and pepper for seasoning. The sauce produced is commonly referred to by the type of stock used e.g. chicken velouté.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=The Escoffier Cookbook and Guide to the Fine Art of Cookery: For Connoisseurs, Chefs, Epicures Complete With 2973 Recipes |last=Escoffier |first=Auguste |coauthors=Adams, Charlotte |year=2000 |publisher=Crown Publishers, Inc |location=New York |isbn=978-0-517-50662-2 |pages=19–21|accessdate=13 April 2010 |edition=55 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
