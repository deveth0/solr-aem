&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Very Proud of Ya&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the second studio album by American [[rock music|rock]] band [[AFI (band)|AFI]]. It was released on June 18, 1996 through [[Nitro Records]].

==Background==
The liner notes of the album state that all the tracks are copyrighted to Anthems For Insubordinates, the band&amp;apos;s name at the time. It is the last album to feature bassist [[Geoff Kresge]], who illustrated the album cover as well. The album features future band member [[Jade Puget]] performing back-up vocals.

The tracks &amp;quot;Two of a Kind&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Yürf Rendenmein&amp;quot; were re-recorded from their debut album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Answer That and Stay Fashionable]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The title of &amp;quot;Love is a Many Splendored Thing&amp;quot; is a reference to [[Love is a Many-Splendored Thing (song)|the song of the same name]] by [[Sammy Fain]] and [[Paul Francis Webster]], although it is not a cover. A music video directed by Darren Doane and Ken Daurio was made for the track &amp;quot;He Who Laughs Last&amp;quot;.
