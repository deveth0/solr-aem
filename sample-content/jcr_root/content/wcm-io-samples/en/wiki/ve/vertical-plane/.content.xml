&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vertical plane&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is used in radio to plot an antenna&amp;apos;s relative [[field strength]] perpendicular to the ground (which directly affects a station&amp;apos;s coverage area) on a [[polar coordinate system|polar graph]].

Normally the maximum of 1.000 or 0 [[Decibel|dB]] is at the side (unless there is [[beam tilt]]), which is labeled 0°, to 90° at the top and &amp;amp;minus;90° at the bottom. Other field strengths are expressed as a decimal less than 1.000, a percentage less than 100%, or [[decibel]]s less than 0 dB.

Most broadcast antennas use either [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] or [[Surface wave|ground wave]] propagation (a slight refraction towards the ground) to reach their nearby listeners, and thus want a low angle in the vertical plane.  Short wave transmitters want a somewhat higher elevation angle in the vertical plane to encourage [[skywave]] propagation, which would refract or reflect radio waves off the [[ionosphere]] and back to the ground at a great distance from the transmitter.

[[Omnidirectional antenna]]s typically try to limit the range of their vertical plane radiation pattern to concentrate energy over a smaller range and increase [[Antenna gain|gain]].
