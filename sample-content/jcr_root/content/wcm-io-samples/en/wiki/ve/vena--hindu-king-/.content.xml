In [[Hindu mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vena&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a great king. However, he became evil and corrupt. The world became so gloomy and dark that the earth-goddess [[Bhumidevi]] decided that she would not provide crops to humans anymore. She took form as a cow and went into hiding. Meanwhile, a group of [[Rishi]]s killed Vena out of anger. They then rubbed the thigh of his corpse, and took out all the evil from his body. Afterwards they rubbed Vena&amp;apos;s arm, and the good [[Prithu]] emerged. This being was [[Vishnu]] incarnate, and as soon as he was born, Vishnu&amp;apos;s [[Sharanga (Hindu mythology)|Sharanga]] bow fell from heaven into his hands. However, Bhumidevi still refused to give crops to people. As soon as Prithu, son of Vena, threatened to kill her, she gave in, but in return Prithu would be her eternal guardian. This is why Bhumidevi is also known as Prithvi.

In the [[Rigveda]] ([[Mandala 10|10]].123), Vena is a personification of a celestial being, perhaps the [[rainbow]]. The name of the hymn is also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vena&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as is the name of the author of [[Mandala 9|RV 9]].85.
