&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vetralla&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a town and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[comune]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the [[province of Viterbo]], in central [[Italy]], 11 km to the south of that city, located on a shoulder of Monte Fogliano.

==History==
Vetralla&amp;apos;s dominating fortified position in the heart of [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] territories has been continuously occupied since the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The Roman site, two kilometers distant, was a posting station on the [[Via Cassia]]; some ruins of walls and paving at S. Maria di Forcassi still mark the Roman [[Forum Cassii]].  The site was depopulated in the later Empire, when a smaller population retreated to the present strategic position commanding the valley, where it remained exposed to attack, in spite of the imposing walls that encircled it.

The little fortress had been incorporated into the [[Papal States]] from their historic beginnings with the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Liutprand the Lombard|Liutprand]]&amp;apos;s [[Donation of Sutri]] (728) to [[Pope Gregory II]], but the lords of [[Viterbo]] held it from 1110 to 1134. By 1145, [[Pope Eugene III]] was installed at Vetralla, apart from the violence and party strife of Rome; from here he issued his bull &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Quantum praedecessores]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, calling for the [[Second Crusade]].

The territory was given extensive woodlands by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1206, which brought it into fierce contention with the lords of Viterbo who coveted the land. To this day, in the annual ceremonial &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sposalizio dell&amp;apos;albero&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;marriage of the tree&amp;quot;), the mayor of Vetralla reaffirms the commune&amp;apos;s   rights of possession on Monte Fogliano. The [[fief]] was entrusted through the centuries to various noble families associated with the Papacy, as lords of Vetralla: first the [[Orsini]], then the Di Vico until 1435, when the last lord [[Giacomo di Vico]] was forcibly ousted by the cardinal-condottiere [[Giovanni Vitelleschi]], confined in the fortress of Soriano, then beheaded. Vetralla then passed in rapid succession among a series of Papal nobles, to Cardinal [[Giovanni Borgia (1474)|Giovanni Borgia]], to Lorenzo Cybo (1529), and to Cardinal [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Alessandro Farnese]] in 1534.
