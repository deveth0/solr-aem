&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vennesla&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in [[Vest-Agder]] [[Counties of Norway|county]], [[Norway]].  Vennesla was separated from [[Øvrebø]] in 1861. Øvrebø and [[Hægeland]] were merged with Vennesla again on 1 January 1964.  It lies about {{convert|17|km}} north of [[Kristiansand]] and it is the third-largest municipality of the county.

==General information==
===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vennesla&amp;apos;&amp;apos; farm ([[Old Norse]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vendilslá&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), since the first church was built there. The first element is the [[genitive case]] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;vendill&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which means &amp;quot;small twig&amp;quot; (maybe used as a name of an arm of [[Venneslafjorden]]) and the last element is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;lá&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which means &amp;quot;swamp&amp;quot;.

===Coat-of-arms===
The [[Coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] is from modern times.  They were granted on 15 May 1971.  The wavy bend in the arms symbolises the [[Otra]] river, which runs through the municipality. The trees symbolize [[forestry]] and the [[Gear|cogwheel]]s symbolize [[industry]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/nor/v/vennesla.htm|author=Norske Kommunevåpen|year=1990|title=Nye kommunevåbener i Norden|accessdate=27 September 2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Geography==
Vennesla is bordered in the west by the municipalities of [[Marnardal]] and [[Songdalen]], in the east by [[Birkenes]] and [[Iveland]]. In the northeast by [[Evje og Hornnes]], and in the south by [[Kristiansand]].

==Economy==
Vennesla has mainly been considered an industrial small town, with Hunsfos Fabrikker AS, a paper mill, as the cornerstone of the community. During recent decades, however, the number of employees has drastically declined from around 1,200 in the 1970s, to 200 in 2005 and 120 in 2007.In 2010 there is 135 employees at the paper mill.
In 2011 Hunsfos Fabrikker AS will celebrate their 125 years as a paper mill.

==Vikeland hovedgård==
There is a mansion in Vennesla, Vikeland hovedgård, which is said to be haunted by a ghost known as &amp;quot;the Blue Lady&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;(den Blå Dama)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Mari, the Blue Lady, was a worker on the farm located there, and fell in love with the farm owner&amp;apos;s son. They were not allowed to marry, so it is said Mari committed suicide by hanging herself in the &amp;quot;blue room&amp;quot;, hence the title &amp;quot;the Blue Lady&amp;quot;. Today, when weddings are held in the mansion, the owners of the property allow the Blue Lady&amp;apos;s ghost to join the wedding festivities by setting an extra place for her at the table.

==Vindbjart Football club==
The local team in Vennesla is [[Vindbjart FK]]. They are currently playing in the [[Norwegian Second Division]] and have their [[stadium]] at Moseidmoen.
