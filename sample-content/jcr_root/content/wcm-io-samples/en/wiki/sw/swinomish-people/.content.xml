The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Swinomish&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (pronounced with the accent on the first syllable){{citation needed|date=January 2011}} are an historically [[Lushootseed language|Lushootseed]]-speaking [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]] [[tribe]] in western [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state in the [[United States]]. The tribe lives in the southeastern part of [[Fidalgo Island]] near the [[San Juan Islands]] in [[Skagit County, Washington]]. Skagit County is located about {{convert|70|mi|km}} north of [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]. The federally recognized &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Swinomish Indians of the Swinomish Reservation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Swinomish Indian Tribal Community&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is headquartered in [[La Conner, Washington|La Conner]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.swinomish-nsn.gov/ Swinomish Indian Tribal Community.] (retrieved 28 July 2009)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Swinomish Indian Reservation==
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Swinomish Indian Reservation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, at {{coord|48|24|05|N|122|31|38|W|scale:100000}}, has a land area of 12.116 sq mi (31.381&amp;amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) and a [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]] resident population of 2,664 persons, with 23% being full-blood Native Americans.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;amp;-context=dt&amp;amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&amp;amp;-CHECK_SEARCH_RESULTS=N&amp;amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;amp;-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_P001&amp;amp;-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_P003&amp;amp;-tree_id=4001&amp;amp;-transpose=N&amp;amp;-all_geo_types=Y&amp;amp;-redoLog=true&amp;amp;-_caller=geoselect&amp;amp;-geo_id=25000US4075&amp;amp;-geo_id=NBSP&amp;amp;-search_results=01000US&amp;amp;-format=&amp;amp;-_lang=en&amp;amp;-show_geoid=Y Swinomish Reservation, Washington] United States Census Bureau&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The Swinomish moved onto reservation lands after the signing of the [[Point Elliott Treaty]] in 1855.&amp;lt;ref name=lvm&amp;gt;Mapes, Lynda V. [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003672493_toxins19m.html &amp;quot;Swinomish are told to restrict shellfish.&amp;quot;] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Seattle Times.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 19 April 2007 (retrieved 28 July 2009)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The Swinomish reservation is a confederation of several distinct tribes of [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]], including the Swinomish, Kikiallus, [[Lower Skagit (tribe)|Lower Skagit]], [[Samish]], and even a few [[Sauk-Suiattle]]. Some Samish tribal members have achieved legal re-recognition separately for the Samish Indian Nation on April 26, 1996 and its government offices are located nearby in Anacortes, Washington. The Kikiallus (Ki Ki Allus) were among the first inhabitants of [[Fir Island (Washington)|Fir Island]], the Skagit River Delta and Valley and the adjacent coastline and islands. As a matter of record the  chief of the tribe, John Lyons AKA (Chief Patch-Akadim ), gave a deposition for the Kikiallus tribe at Swinomish Indian Reservation on March 8, 1927. Chief Lyons is also known for his whimsical toy creations called &amp;quot;folk&amp;quot; Totem Toys. These toys feature mostly small boat like wooded carvings  with totems or animals figureheads, brightly painted for sale to tourists. These toys are highly prized today by collectors and historians alike.

==Language==
The Swinomish people speak a dialect of the [[Salishan]] [[Lushootseed]] language.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.native-languages.org/lushootseed.htm Lushootseed Language (Whulshootseed, Puget Sound Salish).] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Native Languages of the Americas.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (retrieved 28 July 2009)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Culture==

The lifestyle of the Swinomish, like many Northwest Coast tribes, involves the fishing of [[salmon]] and collecting of shellfish. Their fishing rights were guaranteed by the Point Elliott Treaty.&amp;lt;ref name=lvm/&amp;gt;

==Economic development==
The tribe owns and operates the Swinomish Casino, the Two Salmon Cafe, and the Starlight Lounge in [[Anacortes, Washington]], which employ 250 people.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.swinomishcasino.com Swinomish Casino.] (retrieved 28 July 2009)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
