The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Swedish Security Service&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-sv|Säkerhetspolisen}}, literally &amp;quot;the Security Police&amp;quot;, abbreviated &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Säpo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), former name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rikspolisstyrelsens säkerhetsavdelning&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;RPS/SÄK&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, literally &amp;quot;the National Police Board&amp;apos;s Department of Security&amp;quot;), is the [[Intelligence agency|security service]] of [[Sweden]], belonging to the [[Swedish National Police Board]].

== Area of responsibility ==
The Security Service&amp;apos;s areas of responsibility are [[counter-intelligence|counter-espionage]], [[counter-terrorism]], protection of the [[Constitution of Sweden]] and protection of sensitive objects, including [[Monarchy of Sweden|royal]] and diplomatic protection. It is to be expected that its work is often surrounded by a great deal of confidentiality. In recent years, however, there has been a development towards greater openness. It is the duty of the Security Service to detect and take measures against crimes against national security, and in many cases, the Security Service also handles the investigations of such crimes. Sometimes, however, such investigations are carried out by regular police units, while the Security Service provides the necessary intelligence.

==In popular culture==
The Security Service&amp;apos;s role in [[Cold War]] counterintelligence is referred to in the second and third novels of the best-selling &amp;quot;[[Millennium series]]&amp;quot; by Swedish writer [[Stieg Larsson]].
