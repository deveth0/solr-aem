The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xplorer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a named train of the [[New York Central Railroad]] (NYC), between [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xplorer&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an attempt by the NYC to modernize rail travel in [[Ohio]] and lure people out of their cars. The train was built by [[Pullman Car Company|Pullman]] to their lightweight [[Train-X]] design, and was powered by a [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] [[Baldwin RP-210|RP-210]] [[Diesel locomotive#Diesel-hydraulic|Diesel-hydraulic locomotive]].

The train consisted of nine, short, all-[[aluminum]] cars [[Articulated car|articulated]] together. The center car had two axles (one at each end), with the remaining cars having a single axle each, being supported by adjacent cars at the end opposite the axle. The ride was rough, as with most of the other lightweight trains of the period, and the train was not a success.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book

&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The train was retired in 1960, and was sold to Jones Tours, for excursion service. After a long period of storage in South Carolina, the train and locomotive were scrapped around 1970.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://yardlimit.railfan.net/baldwindiesels/rp210/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
