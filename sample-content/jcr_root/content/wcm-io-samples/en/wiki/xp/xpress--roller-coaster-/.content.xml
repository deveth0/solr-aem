&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xpress&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[steel roller coaster|steel]] [[roller coaster]] at [[Walibi Holland]] in [[Biddinghuizen]], [[Netherlands]]. It was launched as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Superman The Ride&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in April 2000. The name was changed to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xpress&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the season of 2005. It is the first LSM-coaster in [[Europe]].

==The Ride==
After the [[train (roller coaster)|train]] has been locked and checked, it slowly advances out of the station to the launch area. The train goes through a tunnel, where the passenger waits until the countdown starts. After the countdown, the trains, which exist out of 2 across in 2 rows for a total of 24 riders per train, are accelerated from 0 - 55.9&amp;amp;nbsp;mph in 2.8 seconds, after which, the ride follows. It first climbs into a roll over loop which is actually 2 inversions. You begin by climbing into a half loop, followed by a half corkscrew, another half corkscrew and ending with a half loop. Then the train plunges into numerous turns and helixes and the 3rd inversion, a 360 degree corkscrew. The train than passes in through a mid course brake run, makes a few turns then travels into the final  brake run and re-enters the station.

==History==
The Xpress / Superman was initially to be called &amp;quot;Riddler&amp;apos;s Revenge&amp;quot; and was painted green at the factory. Shortly before the ride was installed, it was decided that Europeans know of Batman, but not necessarily all of the related villains. So the track was repainted with red and blue supports and given a Superman theme. The station was given the theme of the Daily Planet offices.

The ride was launched in April 2000 in the theme park [[Six Flags Holland]]. After the name of the park was changed to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Walibi World&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the name of the ride was also changed to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xpress&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This happened in 2005.

The Xpress has nearly the same track layout as the &amp;quot;[[Rock &amp;apos;n&amp;apos; Roller Coaster]]&amp;quot; models at Disney Parks. The Xpress&amp;apos; layout is a bit more spacious to compensate for a higher speed launch due to the trains being lighter without the musical hardware.

In 2011, small cracks were found in the [[stator]]s, and their metal inside started to rust. New stators have been ordered, and were delivered in February 2012. Therefore, the coaster was standing but not operating for the whole 2011 season. In August 2011, Walibi Holland decided to re-paint the track, to get rid of the old Superman colors (Black track and White supports.). Xpress Reopened In April 2012.
