&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xpadder&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a program that has the ability to emulate a [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] and/or [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] using a controller or [[joystick]]. This is primarily used for playing games with poor or no controller support, but Xpadder can be used in a web browser, media player, or almost any other application. Xpadder supports the use of up to 16 controllers simultaneously and if a controller supports it, Xpadder can assign a button to make the controller [[Haptic technology|rumble/vibrate]].

== Features ==
*Keyboard and mouse emulation.
*Profile management.
*Support for any controller recognized by [[Microsoft Windows]]
*Support rumble on capable controllers.
*Sets for using keys as a switch and emulating more keys than a controller physically has.

== Limitations ==
Xpadder does not work on some online multiplayer games which make use of anti-cracking software. Games using [[GameGuard]], such as [[MapleStory]], sometimes block Xpadder. Servers running [[PunkBuster]], however, do not have this problem, allowing Xpadder to be used with PunkBuster-enabled games.

&amp;quot;PrtSc&amp;quot; (Print Screen) and &amp;quot;Pause&amp;quot; buttons are not yet supported.

== Development Status ==
*Versions of the program after 5.3 are available as commercial software and are officially supported on the website, while 5.3 and all previous versions are freeware.

==External links==
