        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alcyoneus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alkyoneus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-grc|Ἀλκυονεύς}}) is a name that refers to several distinct figures in [[Greek mythology]].

==The Giant==

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alcyoneus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the eldest of the [[Thrace|Thracian]] [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Gigantes]] of Greek mythology.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;DGRBM&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite encyclopedia  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard | authorlink =   | title = Alcyoneus  | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]  | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 108  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | location = Boston  | year = 1867  | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0117.html }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  He was born (like all other Gigantes) in full [[armor]] with a spear in his hand. He was the most prominent of the Gigantes who led a major rebellion against the [[Olympian Gods]] and was born to defeat Hades, and was said to be immortal in his homeland, Pallene.

[[Isthmus of Corinth]] at the time when [[Heracles]] drove away the oxen of [[Geryon]]. The giant attacked him, crushed twelve wagons and twenty-four of the men of Heracles with a huge block of stone. Heracles himself warded off the stone with his club and slew Alcyoneus. The block with which the giant had attacked Heracles was shown on the isthmus down to a very late period.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Pindar]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nemean Odes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; iv. 44, with the [[Scholiast]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In another passage [[Pindar]] calls Alcyoneus a Thracian shepherd, and places the struggle with him in the Phlegraean plains.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Pindar]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Isthmian Odes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; vi. 45, &amp;amp;c.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

According to [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]], [[Heracles]] sneaked up on Alcyoneus and wounded him, although the giant did not die until Heracles dragged him out of his homeland, Pallene.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]], 1. 34&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

His seven daughters are the [[Alkyonides]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Gigante/GiganteAlkyoneus.html Alcyoneus] at Theoi.com&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Other characters==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alcyoneus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is also the name of three minor mythological figures:

*Alcyoneus, son of Diomus and Meganeira, a handsome youth of [[Delphi]] who was to be given up to [[Sybaris (mythology)|Sybaris]], but was rescued by Eurybarus.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Metamorphoses&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 8&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
*Alcyoneus, an [[Ethiopia]]n who fought under Agamemnon in the [[Trojan War]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fall of Troy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 2. 364&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
*Alcyoneus, an alternate name for [[Ischys]].

==Modern Literature==
In [[Rick Riordan]]&amp;apos;s [[The Son of Neptune]] Alcyoneus is a major villain. [[Hazel Levesque]], a daughter of [[Pluto]] is tricked into raising him in 1941 by creating a body out of precious materials from underground in Alaska. However she sacrificed herself to delay his recreation. Alcyoneus captures the God of Death [[Thanatos]], enabling Monsters and villainous humans to escape the Underworld. He is immortal in Alaska, and wiped out most of the 5th Cohort of Camp Jupiter when they travelled there during the 1980s. However [[Frank Zhang]] is able to free Thanatos and using the divine horse [[Arion]] pulls the Giant from his homeland to Canada, where Frank and the resurrected Hazel kill him.
