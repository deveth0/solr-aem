The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Allen County Courthouse&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] is one of 37 [[United States]] [[National Historic Landmark]]s in the state of [[Indiana]].  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1976 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2003.

==History==
Designed by [[Brentwood S. Tolan]], construction began in 1897, the cornerstone was laid November 17, 1897. The building was dedicated September 23, 1902 with a final cost of $817,553.59. On September 23, 2002, the building was re-dedicated on its [[centennial]] after a seven-year restoration effort, which cost $8.6 million.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;(2002-09-23). Restoration does justiceâ€”The finished work awes and amazes visitors. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The News-Sentinel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Retrieved on 2009-07-25.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Architectural details==
The [[Beaux-Arts architecture]]-style structure includes such features as four 25 by {{convert|45|ft|m|sing=on}} murals by Charles Holloway, twenty-eight different kinds of [[scagiola]] covering {{convert|15000|sqft|m2}}, [[Bas relief|bas-relief]]s and [[art glass]]. Each of the five court rooms has its own color scheme.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Atop the building is a {{convert|255|ft|m|sing=on}}-high copper-clad domed rotunda, itself topped by a {{convert|14|ft|m|sing=on}} statue [[Weather vane|wind vane]] of [[Liberty (goddess)|Lady Liberty]]. The larger than life statue has feet that would wear a woman&amp;apos;s [[shoe size]] of 28.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The building materials include Bedford Limestone and [[Vermont]] [[granite]] with  [[Italy|Italian]] [[marble]] details. A tunnel was constructed to connect the Courthouse with the City-County Building located across the street. The Courthouse also houses a fallout shelter underground. The skylights originally built into the building were covered during [[World War II]] and replaced with artificial light.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The 2001 National Historic Landmark Nomination says in its opening paragraph: &amp;quot;An elaborate combination of Greek, Roman, and Renaissance influences, the massive courthouse reflects the exuberant ambition of late nineteenth century America.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nrhpinv2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite book|title={{PDFlink|[http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/76000031.pdf National Historic Landmark Nomination: Allen County Courthouse]|32&amp;amp;nbsp;KB}}|date=May 5, 2001 |author=Christine Wiltberger, Carolyn Pitts, and Patty Henry |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{PDFlink|[http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Photos/76000031.pdf &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Accompanying 52 page of photos and credits, exterior and interior, from 1999 and undated&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]|32&amp;amp;nbsp;KB}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
