{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alien Syndrome&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|エイリアンシンドローム|Eirian Shindorōmu}} is a [[Shoot &amp;apos;em up#Run and gun|run and gun]] [[arcade game]] developed by [[Sega]] in 1987.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Alien Syndrome.png|thumb|left|Screenshot of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alien Syndrome&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]]
Two players control two soldiers named Ricky and Mary, who must fight their way through large eight-way scrolling levels rescuing their comrades who are being held by aliens. After they have rescued a certain number of hostages the exit opens and they can pass through it in order to fight the [[boss (video gaming)|end-of-level guardian]]. If this monstrosity is defeated, they move onto the next stage.
As well as two player simultaneous gameplay, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alien Syndrome&amp;apos;&amp;apos; features pick-ups which assist the player including better weapons and maps of the current level.

==Ports==
In 1988, the game was [[porting|ported]] to the [[Sega Master System]], [[MSX]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]]/Nintendo Entertainment System (published by [[Tengen (company)|Tengen]]). Later, the game would be ported to the [[ZX Spectrum]] (1989) [[Sega Game Gear]] (1992) and [[Sharp X68000]] (1992), the latter being the only arcade perfect port.

The game was also converted to [[polygonal]] graphics for the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] as part of the [[Sega Ages]] re-release program, and included in US version of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sega Classics Collection]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (it was removed from the European version to receive a lower age certificate). This version has updated controls, adding the use of both analog sticks, similar to the gameplay seen in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Robotron: 2084]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Smash TV]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The original arcade game was also included as an [[Unlockable (gaming)|unlockable]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sonic&amp;apos;s Ultimate Genesis Collection]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

A sequel of the same name, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Alien Syndrome (2007)|Alien Syndrome]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was released for [[Wii]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] on July 24, 2007.

==Reception==
The Sega Master System version of the game was reviewed in 1989 in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; #141 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &amp;quot;The Role of Computers&amp;quot; column.
