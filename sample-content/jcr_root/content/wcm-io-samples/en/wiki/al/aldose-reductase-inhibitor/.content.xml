        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aldose reductase inhibitors&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are a class of [[medication|drugs]] being studied as a way to prevent [[Human eye|eye]] and [[nerve]] damage in people with [[diabetes]].

==Mechanism==
Their target, [[aldose reductase]], is an [[enzyme]] that is normally present in many other parts of the body, and catalyzes one of the steps in the [[sorbitol]]([[polyol]]) pathway that is responsible for [[fructose]] formation from [[glucose]]. Aldose reductase activity increases as the glucose concentration rises in [[diabetes]] in those tissues that are not [[insulin]] sensitive, which include the [[lens (anatomy)|lenses]], peripheral nerves and [[glomerulus]]. Sorbitol does not diffuse through cell membranes easily and therefore accumulates, causing osmotic damage which leads to [[retinopathy]] and [[neuropathy]].

==Examples==
Examples of aldose reductase inhibitors include:
*[[tolrestat]] (withdrawn from market)
*[[epalrestat]]
*[[ranirestat]]&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;pmid17593238&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal |author=Várkonyi T, Kempler P |title=Diabetic neuropathy: new strategies for treatment |journal=[[Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism]] |volume=10 |issue=  2| pages = 070626012134005|year=2007 |pmid=17593238 |doi=10.1111/j.1463-1326.2007.00741.x}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
*[[fidarestat]]

Natural sources reported to inhibit aldose reductase include [[spinach]], [[cumin]] seeds, [[fennel]] seeds, [[basil]] leaves, [[lemon]], [[black pepper]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[Curry tree|curry]] leaves, and [[cinnamon]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;cite pmid| 19114390 &amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite pmid|19114390 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Diabetic cataract==
Diabetic [[cataract]] formation follows an increase in sugars in the [[lens (anatomy)|lens]]. The excess sugar within the lens is reduced by [[aldose reductase]] to its [[alcohol]], but the lens capsule is relatively impermeable to sugar alcohols. Because of the excess sugar alcohol (polyol), the lens imbibes water, causing osmotic imbalance. Eventually, increased [[sodium]] and decreased [[potassium]] levels and decreased [[glutathione]] levels lead to [[cataract]] formation. Topical administration of aldose reductase inhibitors have been shown to prevent the [[cataract]] in rats.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Newell, FW. Ophthalmology: Principles and Concepts, Fifth Edition. London: The CV Mosby Company, 1982, p. 332.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Asthma and COPD==
This class of drugs is also under investigation as a possible root pathology modulating treatment for [[asthma]] and [[COPD]] since it has been shown&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (2011, January 27). Discovery could lead to new therapies for asthma, COPD. ScienceDaily.
