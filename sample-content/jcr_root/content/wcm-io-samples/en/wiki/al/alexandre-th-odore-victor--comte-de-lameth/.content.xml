[[File:Lameth, Alexandre.jpg|thumb|right|Alexandre de Lameth]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alexandre-Théodore-Victor, comte de Lameth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (20 October 1760 – 18 March 1829) was a [[France|French]] soldier and [[politician]].

He was born in [[Paris]].  Having served in the [[American War of Independence]] under [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]], he was sent in 1789 as deputy to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[French States-General|States-General]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by the nobles of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[bailliage]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of [[Péronne]], Somme. In the [[Constituent Assembly]] he formed with [[Antoine Pierre Joseph Marie Barnave|Barnave]] and [[Adrien Duport]] a &amp;quot;Triumvirate,&amp;quot; which controlled a group of about forty deputies forming the advanced left of the Assembly. He presented a famous report in the Constituent Assembly on the organization of the army, but is better known by his eloquent speech on 28 February 1791, at the [[Jacobin Club]], against [[Honoré Mirabeau]], whose relations with the court were beginning to be suspected, and who was a personal enemy of Lameth. However, after the flight of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] to [[Varennes]], Lameth became reconciled with the court. He served in the army as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;maréchal-de-camp&amp;apos;&amp;apos; under [[Nicolas Luckner]] and the [[Marquis de la Fayette]], but was accused of [[treason]] on 15 August 1792, fled the country, and was imprisoned by the [[Austria]]ns.

After his release he went into business at [[Hamburg]] with his brother Charles and the [[Armand, duc d&amp;apos;Aiguillon|duc d&amp;apos;Aiguillon]], and did not return to France until the [[French Consulate|Consulate]]. Under the Empire he was made prefect successively in several departments, and in 1810 was created a baron. In 1814 he attached himself to the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]]s, and under the Restoration was appointed prefect of [[Somme]], deputy for [[Seine-Inférieure]] and finally deputy for [[Seine-et-Oise]], in which capacity he was a leader of the Liberal opposition. He was the author of an important History of the Constituent Assembly (Paris, 2 vols., 1828–1829).

He had two brothers, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Théodore Lameth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1756–1854) who served in the American war, sat in the Legislative Assembly as deputy from the department of Jura, and became maréchal-de-camp; and [[Charles Malo François Lameth]].
