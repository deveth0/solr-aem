[[Image:Alexis Bouvard&amp;apos;s native farm in Contamines Montjoie.jpg|right|thumbnail|Alexis Bouvard&amp;apos;s native farm in Contamines-Montjoie]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alexis Bouvard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (27 June 1767 &amp;amp;ndash; 7 June 1843) was a French [[astronomer]]. He is particularly noted for his careful observations of the irregularities in the motion of [[Uranus]] and his hypothesis of the existence of an eighth planet in the [[solar system]].

==Life==
Born in [[Contamines]], France, Bouvard&amp;apos;s achievements included the discovery of eight [[comet]]s and the compilation of astronomical tables of [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]] and [[Uranus]]. While the former two tables were eminently successful, the latter showed substantial discrepancies with subsequent observations. This led Bouvard to [[hypothesis]]e the existence of an eighth [[planet]] responsible for the irregularities in Uranus&amp;apos; [[orbit]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;eb&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[Anon.] (2001)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The position of [[Neptune]] was subsequently calculated from Bouvard&amp;apos;s observations, independently, by [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]] after his death.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;eb&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Bouvard was eventually director of the [[Paris Observatory]] after starting there as a student astronomer in 1793 and working under [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58193.html}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;   He died in Paris.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;eb&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Honours==
*Member &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[AcadÃ©mie des sciences]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1803);&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;eb&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
*[[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1826);&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;eb&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
*In Australia, a [[cape]] known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cape Bouvard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has been named after him when French sailors discovered Western Australia. [[Bouvard, Western Australia|Bouvard]] is also a semi-rural residential suburb, while Port Bouvard is a major residential development in the same region. All three locations are located within the city of [[Mandurah, Western Australia|Mandurah]] on the southwest coast of Western Australia [http://www.portbouvardmarina.com.au/ Link].
