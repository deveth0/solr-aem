===Observers===

Aside from the unions of the [[Russell Group]] universities (above), the Aldwych Group is also observed by three other bodies:

* The [[University of London Union|University of London Union (ULU)]], due to three of its constituent unions (KCLSU, QMSU, LSESU and UCL Union) being members
* The [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]]
* The [[National Postgraduate Committee]], due to the high numbers of graduate students in the Russell Group and their research-intensive focus
