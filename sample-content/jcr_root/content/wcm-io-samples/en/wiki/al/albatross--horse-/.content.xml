&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Albatross&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1968 - 1998) was a bay [[Standardbred]] [[horse]] by [[Meadow Skipper]]. He was voted [[Harness Horse of the Year]] in 1971 and 1972. Albatross won 59 of 71 starts, including the Cane Pace and Messenger Stakes in 1971, earned $1,201,477. It was, however, as a sire that he really made his mark. Albatross&amp;apos;s 2,546 sons and daughters won $130,700,280.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; [http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/06/sports/plus-horse-racing-harness-racing-albatross-dies.html Albatross lifetime record as a sire.] &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Racing career==
Trained and driven by Harry Harvey from the time he was a yearling until a week before his three-year-old season and later [[Stanley Dancer]], he won 25 of his 28 races as a three-year-old, including the [[Adios Stakes]], the [[Cane Pace]], and the [[Messenger Stakes]]. As a three-year-old he also set a record for fastest race mile with two races in 1:54.4 at [[The Red Mile]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. He broke this record as a four-year-old with a race in 1:54.3 at [[Sportsman&amp;apos;s Park]] in [[Chicago]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; [http://www.harness.org.au/ausbreed/reports/performance.cfm?horse_id=306502 Stats Albatross] &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; [http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/albatross Pedigree Albatross] &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Albatross set the single-season harness horse earnings record of $558,009 in 1971.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Looney, Douglas S.

Accessed February 19, 2009.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Stud record==
After his four-year-old racing season he retired to stud at [[Hanover Shoe Farms]] in [[Hanover, Pennsylvania]]. One of his sons [[Niatross]] was the winner of the [[Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers]] in [[1980 in sports|1980]] and in that year was also a world champion with a mark of 1:49.1). Others were [[Fan Hanover]], [[Merger (harness horse)|Merger]], [[Colt Fortysix]], and [[Jaguar Spur]], all, like Niatross, winners of the [[Little Brown Jug (horse racing)|Little Brown Jug]]. He was also an outstanding broodmare sire.

In 1998, Albatross died at the age of 30 at Hanover Shoe Farm in Pennsylvania of complications from heart failure and colic. He was buried at the Hanover Shoe Farms horse cemetery.
