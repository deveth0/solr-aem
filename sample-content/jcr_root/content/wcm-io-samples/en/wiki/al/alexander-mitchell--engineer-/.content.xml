&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alexander Mitchell&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (13 April 1780 – 25 June 1868) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[engineer]] who from 1802 was [[blindness|blind]]. He is known as the [[inventor]] of the [[screw-pile lighthouse]]. He was a native of [[Dublin]], and received his formal education at  [[Belfast Academy]] where he excelled in [[mathematics]].

Mitchell was a brickmaker in [[Belfast]] who invented machines used in that trade, and the [[Screwpile|screw-pile]] for which he gained some fame. The screw-pile was used for the erection of [[lighthouse]]s and other structures on mudbanks and shifting sands, and employed with great success all over the world from [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] breakwater to [[Bombay]] bridges. It was used for the construction of lighthouses on [[Maplin Sands]] in the [[Thames Estuary]] (the first light application, in 1838), at [[Morecambe Bay]] (the first completed, in 1839), and at [[Belfast Lough]] where his lighthouse was finished in July 1844.

In 1848 he was elected member of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] and received the [[Telford Medal]] for a paper on his invention.

In May 1851 he moved to [[Cobh]] to lay the foundation for that lighthouse; the success of these undertakings led to the use of his invention on the breakwater at [[Portland Harbour|Portland]], the viaduct and bridges on the [[Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway]] and the whole system of Indian telegraphs.

He was friendly with [[astronomer]] [[John Thomas Romney Robinson]], and [[mathematician]] [[George Boole]]. He died at [[Glen Devis]] near Belfast on 25 June 1868.
