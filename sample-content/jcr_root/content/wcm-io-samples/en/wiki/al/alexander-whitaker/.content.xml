[[File:Baptism of Pocahontas.jpg|thumb|Whitaker (left, in white vestments) as portrayed in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Baptism of Pocahontas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1840, by [[John Gadsby Chapman]]]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alexander Whitaker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1585–1616) was a Christian [[theologian]] who settled in North America in [[Virginia Colony]] in 1611 and established two churches near the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] colony, and was known as &amp;quot;The Apostle of Virginia&amp;quot; by contemporaries.

Born in [[Cambridge]], he was the son of [[William Whitaker (theologian)|William Whitaker]] (1548–1595), noted Protestant scholar and Master of [[St. John&amp;apos;s College, Cambridge]]. Whitaker was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and became a clergyman in the North of England.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Venn|id=WHTR602A|name=Whitaker, Alexander}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Travelling to Virginia in 1611, he was a popular religious leader with both settlers and natives, and was responsible for the baptism and conversion of [[Pocahontas]]. Her name became &amp;quot;Rebecca&amp;quot;. Reverend Richard Bucke of [[Wymondham]] officiated her marriage to [[John Rolfe]] on April 5, 1614. His relative tolerance of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] population that English colonists encountered can be found in his sermons, some of which were sent back to [[England]] to help win support for the new colonies in [[North America]]. The most famous of these sermons is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Good Newes from Virginia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1613), in which he describes the native population as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;servants of sinne and slaves of the divill,&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; but also recognizes them as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;sons of Adam,&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; who are &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;a very understanding generation, quicke of apprehension, suddaine in their despatches, subtile in their dealings, exquisite in their inventions, and industrious in their labour.&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Before leaving England, Whitaker had crossed paths with a York merchant who later became an English naval captain and explorer of [[New England]], [[Christopher Levett]] of [[York]]. In Whitaker&amp;apos;s will of 1610, and proved following his death in 1616, Whitaker noted that he owed &amp;quot;Christopher Levite, a linen draper of the city of York&amp;quot; just over £5.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=wZS_LGEg7kAC&amp;amp;pg=PA147&amp;amp;lpg=PA147&amp;amp;dq=%22christopher+levite%22+massachusetts&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=0x2UK34k3v&amp;amp;sig=Wkt71npR7OdKTajoP5zxPUcGce0&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=PgK8Sp26EIi0sgP8jYm7BA&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=5#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;f=false The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 11, Virginia HIstorical Society, Richmond, 1903]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Trained as a York merchant, Levett later founded the first settlement at [[Portland, Maine]], where he was granted {{convert|6000|acre|km2}} by the King. The settlement failed.

Whitaker drowned in 1616.
