&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alexander Balas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-grc|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ἀλέξανδρoς Bάλας}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), ruler of the [[Greece|Greek]] [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid kingdom]] in 150–146 BC, was a native of [[İzmir|Smyrna]] of humble origin, but gave himself out to be the son of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] and [[Laodice IV]] and heir to the Seleucid throne. Along with his sister [[Laodice VI]], the youngster Alexander was &amp;quot;discovered&amp;quot; by Heracleides, a former minister of Antiochus IV and brother of [[Timarchus]], an usurper in [[Medes|Media]] who had been executed by the reigning king [[Demetrius I of Syria|Demetrius I Soter]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;DGRBM&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite encyclopedia  | last = Smith  | first = Philip Peter | authorlink =  | title = Alexander Balas | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]  | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 114–115  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | location = Boston  | year = 1867  | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0123.html }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Alexander&amp;apos;s claims were recognized by the [[Roman Senate]], [[Ptolemy VI of Egypt|Ptolemy Philometor of Egypt]] and others. He married [[Cleopatra Thea]], a daughter of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. At first unsuccessful, Alexander finally defeated Demetrius Soter in 150 BC. Being now master of the empire, he is said to have abandoned himself to a life of debauchery. Whatever the truth behind this, the young king was forced to depend heavily on his Ptolemaic support and even struck portraits with the characteristic features of king [[Ptolemy I]].

Demetrius Soter&amp;apos;s son [[Demetrius II of Syria|Demetrius II]] profited by the opportunity to regain the throne. Ptolemy Philometor, who was Alexander&amp;apos;s father-in-law, went over to his side, and Alexander was defeated in the  [[battle of Antioch (145 BC)]] in Syria, sometimes known as the battle of the Oenoparus.

He fled for refuge to a [[Nabataea]]n prince, who murdered him and sent his head to Ptolemy Philometor, who had been mortally wounded in the engagement.
