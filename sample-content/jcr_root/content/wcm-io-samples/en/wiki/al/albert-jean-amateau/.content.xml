&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Albert Jean Amateau&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 20, 1889 &amp;amp;ndash; February 9, 1996) was a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[rabbi]], [[businessman]], [[lawyer]] and [[social activist]].

==Early years ==
Born a [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jew]]  in [[Milas]], [[Turkey]], Amateau attended the American International College in [[İzmir]] (Smyrna), [[Turkey]]. He emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1910.

==Activism ==
In the early 1920s, Amateau began a movement to bring more [[Jew]]s into the workplace and government. He was also involved largely in the affairs of deaf people. After he returned from serving in the army in [[World War I]], Amateau was ordained in 1920 at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]], and he became the first rabbi of a congregation of the deaf. In 1941, Amateau developed the Albert J. Amateau Foreign Language Service, a business providing translators for lipsync dubbing for motion pictures which continued in operation until 1989.

An ardent supporter of his homeland of [[Turkey]], Amateau began various Turkish-oriented organizations while residing in the United States. In 1992, at the age of 103, he helped found the [[American Society of Jewish Friends of Turkey]] and was named as its president.

Amateau was also an advocate of peace, and in 1937, he assisted with negotiations between Jews and [[Arab]]s of [[Palestine]].

Amateau died in 1996 at the age of 106 years, 9 months, 20 days.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Collection&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|title = Albert J.
