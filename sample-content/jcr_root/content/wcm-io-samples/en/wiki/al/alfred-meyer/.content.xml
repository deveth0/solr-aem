Dr. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alfred Meyer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (5 October 1891 &amp;amp;ndash; 11 April 1945) was a [[Nazism|Nazi]] official. By the time of his death at the [[end of World War II in Europe]], he was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Staatssekretär&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and Deputy Reichsminister in the [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reichministerium für die Besetzten Ostgebiete&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ostministerium&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)He was also an archaeologist studying toponomy.

== Early life ==

Meyer was born in [[Göttingen]], the son of a government official. He was educated at the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Soest, Germany|Soest]], graduating in 1911. In 1912 he became a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fahnenjunker&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (cadet officer) with Infanterieregiment 68 (Koblenz), passing his officer exam in 1913. During [[World War I]] he fought with Infanterieregiment 363 on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], winning the [[Iron Cross]] twice. In 1917 he was injured and captured by the French. Released in March 1920, he left the army with the rank of Oberleutnant.

After the war, Meyer worked for Deutsche Erdöl AG before studying [[political science]] at the Universities of [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] and then [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]]. He graduated with a [[Ph.D.]] in 1922 and joined the legal department of a [[Gelsenkirchen]] mining firm. He married Anna Dorothee Schenker in 1920.

== Third Reich ==

In April 1928, Meyer joined the [[Nazi Party]] and became a local group leader in October 1929. In September 1930 he became a member of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and in January 1931 NSDAP Gauleiter in north [[Westphalia]]. Following the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Alfred Meyer was appointed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reichsstatthalter&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (deputy governor) of [[Free State of Lippe|Lippe]] und [[Free State of Schaumburg-Lippe|Schaumburg-Lippe]] in May 1933 and he was made &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Staatsminister&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (governor) of the federal government for Lippe und Schaumburg-Lippe in August 1936.

In 1939, Meyer was made &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chef der Zivilverwaltung&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and in 1941 he became deputy to [[Alfred Rosenberg]] in the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories. Meyer was responsible for the departments of politics, administration and economics. In this role he directed the exploitation of the occupied [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] areas, the suppression and murder of its inhabitants, particularly [[Jew]]s, and the organisation of [[slave labour]].

Meyer attended the [[Wannsee conference]] in January 1942 as a representative for Rosenberg. In November that year, he was also made &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reichsverteidigungskommissar&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Reich Defense Commissioner) of Defense District VI (northern Westphalia).

== Death ==

Meyer was found dead on April 11, 1945, by the River [[Weser]]. The cause of death was [[suicide]], most likely prompted by Germany&amp;apos;s impending defeat in the war.

== Fictional portrayals ==

In the 2001 [[HBO]] film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Conspiracy (2001 film)|Conspiracy]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,  Meyer was played by [[Brian Pettifer]].
