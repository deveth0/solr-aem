&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alan Goodrick&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is usually known by his [[nom de guerre]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gimpo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He is best known as a friend and collaborator of [[The KLF]] and the [[K Foundation]]. He filmed (and owns the print of) the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; film, drove [[Bill Drummond]] and [[Mark Manning]] to the top of the world (as recounted in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bad Wisdom]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), and was the ski-masked person fumbling with lighter fluid and matches when [[Rachel Whiteread]] came to claim the [[K Foundation art award]]. He is currently an underground/alternative arts film maker and is frequently involved with both Drummond and [[Jimmy Cauty]]&amp;apos;s current projects. Although he has claimed that he has given up the role, he is often described as a [[roadie]].

He also organises an annual 25-hour drive around the [[M25 motorway|M25]] called the M25 spin, repeated every year on the weekend closest to 23 March (with many KLF fans from around the world joining in). The first time this took place was in 1997 when he was accompanied by Bill Drummond and artist Dave Green, and has produced a film of this event. The M25 spin can be seen as exploring similar motifs as [[Iain Sinclair]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[London Orbital (book)|London Orbital]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; book.

==Background and character==

According to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bad Wisdom&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, he was born and raised in [[Manchester]] (although there are rumours that Gimpo himself says he&amp;apos;s from Mold in [[Wales]]), and is a &amp;apos;brother-in-law&amp;apos; to [[Mark Manning]]. Gimpo was a squaddie and served with the [[British Army]] in the [[Falklands War]]. After that war he met up with Zodiac and started to work part-time his band &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Love Reaction&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. After a period as a roadie for various [[Food Records]] bands (e.g. [[Jesus Jones]]) he set up Pit Bull management and began to manage the Love Reaction.
