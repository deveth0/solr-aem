The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Altmühl&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a river in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. It is a left tributary of the River [[Danube]] and is approximately 230&amp;amp;nbsp;kilometres in length.

==Overview==
[[File:Essing Altmühl2009 P1020203.jpeg|thumb|left|Old Altmühl at Essing, between Dietfurt and Kelhheim]]
The source of the Altmühl is located close to the city of Ansbach. From here the river runs southeastwards as a narrow brook to enter the Altmühlsee (a lake) north of [[Gunzenhausen]]. After leaving Gunzenhausen the river describes a broad curve through the [[Frankish Alb]]. It enters the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Altmühl Valley Nature Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which is famous for its natural beauty: The [[meander]]s of the Altmühl River have cut deep gorges into the mountains of the Frankish Alb.

The Altmühl passes the cities of [[Treuchtlingen]], [[Eichstätt]] and [[Beilngries]]. After [[Dietfurt]] the river bed was straightened and integrated into a canal connecting the [[Main (river)|River Main]] and River Danube (the [[Rhine-Main-Danube Canal]]). In spite of protests by conservationists{{cn|date=July 2012}} the canal was opened in 1992 and has changed much of the eastern Altmühl Valley. The Altmühl finally meets the Danube in [[Kelheim]].
