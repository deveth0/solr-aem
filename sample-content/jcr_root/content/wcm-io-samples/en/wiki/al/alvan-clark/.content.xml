&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alvan Clark&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (March 8, 1804 â€“ August 19, 1887), born in [[Ashfield, Massachusetts|Ashfield]], [[Massachusetts]], the descendant of a Cape Cod whaling family of [[English people|English]] ancestry,[http://www.nndb.com/people/702/000167201/] was an [[United States|American]] [[astronomy|astronomer]] and [[telescope]] maker.  He was a portrait painter and engraver (ca.1830s-1850s), and at the age of 40 became involved in telescope making. Using glass blanks made by [[Chance Brothers]] of Birmingham and [[Feil-Mantois]] of Paris, his firm &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Alvan Clark &amp;amp; Sons]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ground lenses for [[refracting telescope]]s, including the largest in the world at the time: the {{convert|18.5|in|mm|sing=on}} at [[Dearborn Observatory]] at the [[Old University of Chicago]] (the lens was originally intended for [[Ole Miss]]), the two {{convert|26|in|mm|sing=on}} telescopes at the [[United States Naval Observatory]] and [[McCormick Observatory]], the {{convert|30|in|mm|sing=on}} at [[Pulkovo Observatory]] (destroyed in the [[Siege of Leningrad]]; only the lens survives), the {{convert|36|in|mm|sing=on}} telescope at [[Lick Observatory]] (still third-largest) and later the {{convert|40|in|mm|sing=on}} at [[Yerkes Observatory]], which remains the largest successful refracting telescope in the world.  One of Clark&amp;apos;s sons, [[Alvan Graham Clark]], discovered the dim companion of [[Sirius]]. His other son was [[George Bassett Clark]]; both sons were partners in the firm.

Two [[Impact crater|craters]] bear his name.  The [[Clark (lunar crater)|Clark]] on the [[Moon]] is joinly named for him and his son, Alvan Graham Clark,  and one on [[Mars]] is named in his honor.
