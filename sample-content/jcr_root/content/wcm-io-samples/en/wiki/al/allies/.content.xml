In everyday [[English language|English]] usage, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;allies&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are [[people]], groups, or [[sovereign state|states]] that have joined in an association for mutual benefit or to achieve some common purpose, whether or not explicit agreement has been worked out between them. When the term is used in the context of [[war]] or armed struggle, such associations may also be called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;allied powers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, especially when discussing [[World War&amp;amp;nbsp;I]] or [[World War&amp;amp;nbsp;II]].

A formal [[military alliance]] is not required for being perceived as an ally—[[co-belligerence]], fighting alongside someone, is enough. According to this usage, allies become so not when concluding an alliance treaty but when struck by war.

When spelled with a capital &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, the word &amp;quot;Allies&amp;quot; usually denotes the countries who fought together against the [[Central Powers]] in World War&amp;amp;nbsp;I (the [[Allies of World War&amp;amp;nbsp;I]]), or those who fought against the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis Powers]] in World War&amp;amp;nbsp;II (the [[Allies of World War&amp;amp;nbsp;II]]). The term has also been used by the [[United States Army]] to describe the countries that gave assistance to the [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |last1=Larsen |first1=Stanley|authorlink=|last2=Collins|first2=James |title=Allied Participation in Vietnam |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/allied/ |accessdate=January 15, 2013|series=Vietnam Studies |year=1975 |publisher=Department of the Army |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=1119579|page= |pages=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

More recently, the term &amp;quot;Allied forces&amp;quot; has also been used to describe the [[coalition of the Gulf War]], as opposed to forces the [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|Multi-National Forces in Iraq]] which are commonly referred to as &amp;quot;Coalition forces&amp;quot; or, as by the [[George W. Bush]] administration, [[Coalition of the willing|&amp;quot;the coalition of the willing&amp;quot;]].

The Allies in World War&amp;amp;nbsp;I (also known as the [[Triple Entente|Entente Powers]]) were initially the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], the [[Russian Empire]], [[Kingdom of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], joined later by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], the [[United States]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] and [[Brazil]]. Some, such as the Russian Empire, withdrew from the war before the armistice due to revolution or defeat by the Central Powers.
