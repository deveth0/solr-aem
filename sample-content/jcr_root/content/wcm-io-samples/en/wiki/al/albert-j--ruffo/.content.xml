        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Albert J. Ruffo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (July 1, 1908&amp;amp;nbsp;– February 10, 2003) was a [[politician]], [[philanthropist]], [[educator]], [[lawyer]], and football coach.

Ruffo grew up in [[Tacoma, Washington]]. In 1927 he moved to [[San Jose, California]] to attend nearby [[Santa Clara University]], where he played [[American football|football]], and graduated with degrees in [[political science]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[literature]]. After graduating in 1931, Ruffo taught in the university&amp;apos;s school of engineering and coached the freshman football team to help pay for attending law school.  In 1936 he graduated at the head of his class from [[Santa Clara University School of Law]]. After passing the [[bar exam]], he continued to coach football with the university as the assistant varsity coach under legendary [[Santa Clara University Broncos|SCU]] head coach [[Buck Shaw|Lawrence T. &amp;quot;Buck&amp;quot; Shaw]] and helped lead the team to victory in the 1937 and 1938 [[Sugar Bowl]]s against [[Louisiana State University|LSU]].

In San Francisco, Ruffo and a former college football teammate, [[Tony Morabito]], became partners in a lumber delivery business. But Morabito soon began to focus on starting a pro football franchise and Ruffo was enlisted to set up the legal framework for what was to become Morabito&amp;apos;s [[San Francisco 49ers]], who began play in the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC) in 1946.  While waiting for the 49ers&amp;apos; (and the AAFC&amp;apos;s) first season of operation Buck Shaw and Ruffo spent the 1945 season as Head Coach and Assistant for the [[California Golden Bears football|University of California Golden Bears]].

He was an assistant coach to Buck Shaw for the 49ers first two years of operation, which happened to be while he was serving as mayor of [[San Jose, California]]. He later became a part owner of the team and remained so for 24 years until it was sold to [[Edward J. DeBartolo, Jr.|Eddie DeBartolo, Jr.]] in 1977.

He served eight years on the San Jose city council (1944–1952), and was the city&amp;apos;s 48th [[mayor]] from 1946 to 1948. During his time on the council, [[A. P. Hamann]], another of Ruffo&amp;apos;s teammates at Santa Clara, was hired as [[city manager]] and the rapid growth of San Jose began. After leaving public office, Ruffo worked as an attorney, specializing in [[land development]] law; Ruffo represented land developers in many of the city&amp;apos;s [[annexation]] and [[zoning]] hearings, lawsuits, and deals.

A 1979 [[San Jose State University]] study ranked Ruffo as one of the 10 most powerful people in San Jose. In 1997, he was inducted into the [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] Sports Hall of Fame.

The scrappy former football lineman was vibrant to the end, filing a suit in 1998 against San Jose&amp;apos;s new leaders to stop them from using redevelopment funds to build a [[San Jose City Hall|new city hall]]. In 2001 when he won a state appeals court ruling in the case.
