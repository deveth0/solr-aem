&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Matapan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (D43)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a later or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;1943&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Battle class destroyer|Battle-class]] fleet [[destroyer]] of the [[Royal Navy]] (RN). She was named after the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] between the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Regia Marina]], and which ended in a decisive victory for the RN force, resulting in the destruction of three cruisers and two destroyers of the Italian Navy and was a heavy blow to the Italians, coming only months after their battleship fleet had been mortally wounded at [[Battle of Taranto|Taranto]]. So far, she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear that name.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Matapan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was built by [[John Brown &amp;amp; Company]]. She was launched on 30 April 1945 and commissioned on 5 September 1947.

She was placed in Reserve just before she commissioned and would remain in such a state for a lengthy period of time, yet in the process she outlived all her sister-ships in Royal Navy service. In 1970, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Matapan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was towed to [[Portsmouth]] where she began her conversion to a Sonar Trials Ship that resulted in her appearance becoming radically different from when she was launched in 1945.

In 1973, upon her conversion being completed, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Matapan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; entered active service for the very first time, joining the [[Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment]] (AUWE), based in [[Portland Harbour|Portland]]. It was to be quite a short career for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Matapan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, when after a variety of [[sonar]] trials, which included co-operation  with foreign navies, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Matapan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was decommissioned in 1978. She was broken up the following year at [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]] in [[Northumberland]].
