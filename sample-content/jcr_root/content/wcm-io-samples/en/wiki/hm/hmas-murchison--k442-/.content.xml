&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMAS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Murchison&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (K442/F442)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a Modified River (or [[Bay class frigate]] of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). The ship was laid down in 1943, but not commissioned until after the end of [[World War II]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Murchison&amp;apos;&amp;apos; fought in the [[Korean War]], was decommissioned in 1956, and sold for scrap in 1961.

==Construction==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Murchison&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was one of four Bay class frigates constructed in [[Australia]] during World War II, being laid down by [[Evans Deakin and Company]] Limited in [[Brisbane]] on 3 June 1943. She was launched on 31 October 1944, and commissioned into the RAN on 17 December 1945. She named for the [[Murchison River (Western Australia)|Murchison River]] in [[Western Australia]].&amp;lt;ref name=SPC&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-murchison-i |title=HMAS Murchison |accessdate=15 September 2008 |publisher=Sea Power Centre Australia}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Operational history==
Completed too late in the war to take part in the fighting, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Murchison&amp;apos;&amp;apos; began her career by visiting [[Morotai]], [[Ternate]], and the [[Sulawesi|Celebes]] for surveillance duties and [[War Graves Commission]] tasks, before sailing to Japan and joining the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]]. The frigate returned to Australia in May 1946.&amp;lt;ref name=SPC/&amp;gt;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Murchison&amp;apos;&amp;apos; later saw extensive operational service during the [[Korean War]] and was involved in the [[Naval Battle of Han River (1951)|Naval Battle of Han River]] on 28–30 September 1951, during which she was heavily engaged by Chinese shore installations while conducting riverine operations. Four sailors were wounded in the encounter, while &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Murchison&amp;apos;&amp;apos; destroyed a number of Chinese gun positions.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Coulthard-Clark 2001, p. 265.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The frigate was awarded the [[battle honour]] &amp;quot;Korea 1951–52&amp;quot; for her actions during the war.&amp;lt;ref name=newhonours&amp;gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/Navy_Marks_109th_Birthday_With_Historic_Changes_To_Battle_Honours |title=Navy Marks 109th Birthday With Historic Changes To Battle Honours |date=1 March 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110613184920/http://www.navy.gov.au/Navy_Marks_109th_Birthday_With_Historic_Changes_To_Battle_Honours |archivedate=13 June 2011 |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=honourslist&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Units_entitlement_list.pdf |title=Royal Australian Navy Ship/Unit Battle Honours |date=1 March 2010 |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110614064156/http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Units_entitlement_list.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2011 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On 3 October 1952, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Murchison&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was present of the [[Montebello Islands]] for the [[Operation Hurricane]] nuclear weapons test.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-03/atom-bomb-veterans-remember-blast-that-changed-lives/4294276 |title=Atom bomb veterans remember life-changing blast |last=Trembath |first=Brendan |date=3 October 2012 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
