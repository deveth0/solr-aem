&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Javelin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (F61)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[J and K class destroyer|J-class]] [[destroyer]] of the [[Royal Navy]] laid down by [[John Brown &amp;amp; Company|John Brown and Company]], Limited, at [[Clydebank]] in [[Scotland]] on 11 October 1937, launched on 21 December 1938, and commissioned on 10 June 1939.

At the end of November 1940, the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, consisting of the HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jupiter&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Javelin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jackal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jersey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kashmir&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, under Captain [[Lord Louis Mountbatten]], was operating off Plymouth, England. The flotilla engaged the German destroyers [[German destroyer Z10 Hans Lody|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hans Lody&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], [[German destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Richard Beitzen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], and [[German destroyer Z20 Karl Galster|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Karl Galster&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]]. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Javelin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was badly damaged by [[torpedo]] and [[artillery]] hits from the German destroyers and lost both her bow and her stern. Only 155&amp;amp;nbsp;feet of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Javelin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s original 353&amp;amp;nbsp;foot length remained afloat and she was towed back to harbour. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Javelin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was out of action for almost a year. Probably arising from this incident, Stoker First Class T Robson was killed and is interred at St Pol de Leon Cemetery, Brittany, France.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Javelin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; participated in the [[Battle of Madagascar|Operation Ironclad]] assault on [[Madagascar]] in May 1942.

She participated in the failed [[Operation Vigorous]] attempt to deliver a supply [[Malta Convoys|convoy]] to [[Malta]], in June 1942.

The crew of HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Javelin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; mutinied on 17 October 1945 whilst the ship was anchored off [[Rhodes]] and several ratings were subsequently court-martialled.

HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Javelin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was sold to the shipbreakers on 11 June 1949, and she was scrapped at [[Troon]] in [[Scotland]].
