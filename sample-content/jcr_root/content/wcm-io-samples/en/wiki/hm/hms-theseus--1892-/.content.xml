&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theseus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[Edgar class cruiser|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Edgar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] [[protected cruiser]] of the [[Royal Navy]]. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Edgars&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were basically smaller versions of the [[Blake class cruiser|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Blake&amp;apos;&amp;apos; class]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theseus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was launched at [[Leamouth]], [[London]] in 1892 and commissioned on 14 January 1896.

Upon commission, she was part of the [[Special Flying Squadron]]. She was a tender ship to [[HMS Cambridge (shore establishment)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cambridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] from 1905 to 1913. In February 1913, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theseus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; joined the [[Queenstown, Ireland|Queenstown]] Training Squadron.

When war broke out in 1914, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theseus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; joined the [[10th Cruiser Squadron]]. On 14 October, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theseus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, accompanied by her sister-ship [[HMS Hawke (1891)|HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hawke&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], were patrolling the [[North Sea]] when they were attacked by [[Unterseeboot 9 (1910)|U-9]]. The submarines first torpedo missed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theseus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; but hit &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hawke&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, igniting a magazine that caused a tremendously powerful explosion, that ripped much of the ship apart. Just 70 of her 594 crew survived.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theseus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was rearmed, along with bulges to her hull, which were added to enable her to take part in the [[Dardanelles Campaign]]. In 1916 she was deployed to the [[Mediterranean]] and was then sent to the [[White Sea]]. In 1918 she was sent to the [[Aegean Sea]] to be charged with the mundane task of being a [[depot ship]]. In 1919, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theseus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; had her final deployment, when she was sent to the [[Black Sea]]. She returned to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1920 and was scrapped the following year in Germany.
