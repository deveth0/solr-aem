Three ships and two shore installations of the Royal Australian Navy have been named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMAS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Penguin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; after the aquatic, flightless bird:

* {{HMAS|Penguin|1913}}, a composite sloop originally commissioned by the [[Royal Navy]], before being transferred to the RAN in 1913 as a depot ship
* HMAS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Penguin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a second-class protected cruiser, {{HMAS|Encounter|1902|6}}, that was renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Penguin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1923 when it was converted to accommodations
* HMAS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Penguin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a submarine depot ship HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Platypus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; built for the Royal Navy before transferring to the RAN as {{HMAS|Platypus|1917|6}} in 1919 and renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Penguin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1929. The ship was renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Platypus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1941.
* HMAS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Penguin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the Royal Australian Navy&amp;apos;s primary naval base on the east coast of Australia, located on Garden Island in Sydney, was known as HMAS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Penguin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; until it was renamed {{HMAS|Kuttabul|naval base|6}} in January 1943.
* {{HMAS|Penguin|naval base}}, one of the RAN&amp;apos;s major training establishments, located in Balmoral, New South Wales.

Three other bases were established as subordinate to the Garden Island base. These were also given the name HMAS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Penguin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but with a Roman numeral suffix added:

* HMAS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Penguin II&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, naval base at Balmoral, New South Wales, until renamed {{HMAS|Penguin|naval base|6}} in January 1943
* HMAS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Penguin III&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a Naval depot in Newcastle, which was subsequently commissioned as {{HMAS|Maitland|naval base|6}} on 1 August 1940
* HMAS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Penguin IV&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a Naval depot in Darwin which was commissioned in September 1939, and subsequently commissioned as {{HMAS|Melville|naval base|6}} on 1 August 1940
