&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Artful&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the third [[Astute class submarine|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Astute&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] nuclear-powered [[fleet submarine]] of the [[Royal Navy]]. She is the second submarine of the Royal Navy to bear this name. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Artful&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was ordered from [[GEC-Marconi|GEC&amp;apos;s]] [[Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd|Marconi Marine]] (now [[BAE Systems Submarine Solutions]]) on 17 March 1997, and is under construction at [[Barrow in Furness]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/EquipmentAndLogistics/SecondAstuteClassSubmarineOfficiallyNamed.htm MoD] Second Astute Class submarine officially named&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;


==Design==
=== Nuclear power ===
Artful&amp;apos;s nuclear reactor will not need to be refuelled during the boat&amp;apos;s 25 year service. Since the submarine can replenish her air supply and purify water underway and while submerged, she will be able to circumnavigate the planet without resurfacing. The submarine&amp;apos;s main limitation will be from the three months supply of food carried for the 98 officers and ratings.

=== Weapons ===
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Artful&amp;apos;&amp;apos; will carry a mix of 38 weapons in six 21-inch (533&amp;amp;nbsp;mm) torpedo tubes;
* [[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] Block IV cruise missiles. Range of {{convert|1350|nmi|km}}.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6625477.stm Alien submarine breaks technical barriers] BBC News. (7 May 2007).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
* [[Spearfish torpedo]]es.
