&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Flinders&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was laid down by [[HMA Naval Dockyard]] at [[Williamstown, Victoria]] on 11 June 1971. She was launched on 29 July 1972 and commissioned into the RAN on 27 April 1973.

Following the destruction of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] by [[Cyclone Tracy]] during the night of 24-25 December 1974, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Flinders&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was deployed as part of the relief effort; [[Operation Navy Help Darwin]].&amp;lt;ref name=NavyHelp&amp;gt;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Flinders&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was decommissioned in 1998.  After decommissioning she was sold to a private party and remodeled into a luxury super yacht.  Her current name is &amp;quot;M/Y Plan B&amp;quot;.
