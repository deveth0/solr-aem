&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ocelot&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (S17)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[Oberon class submarine|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oberon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class]] diesel-electric [[submarine]] laid down by [[Chatham Dockyard|HM Dockyard at Chatham]] in [[Kent]] on 17 November 1960, launched on 5 May 1962 and commissioned on 31 January 1964. She joined the 3rd [[Flotilla]] based at [[HMNB Clyde]], in [[Faslane]]. HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ocelot&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the last submarine built for the Royal Navy at Chatham Dockyard, although three more &amp;apos;O&amp;apos; class submarines&amp;amp;mdash;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ojibwa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Onondaga&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Okanagan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;amp;mdash;were built for the [[Royal Canadian Navy]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ocelot&amp;apos;&amp;apos; attended the 1977 Silver Jubilee [[Fleet Review]] off [[Spithead]] when she was part of the Submarine Flotilla.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Official Souvenir Programme, 1977. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Silver Jubilee Fleet Review&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, HMSO&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ocelot&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was paid off in August 1991 as the conventional submarine fleet of the RN began to decline, making way for the nuclear fleet. She was sold in 1992 and preserved as a fully tourable museum in [[Chatham Historic Dockyard]].
