A third ship was planned as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fleetwood&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but was renamed before being launched:

*{{HMS|Fleetwood|1655|6}} was a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] ship captured by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]]s in 1655 and renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wexford&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

*{{HMS|Fleetwood|U73|6}} was a [[Grimsby class sloop|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grimsby&amp;apos;&amp;apos; class]] [[sloop]] launched in 1936 and broken up after 1959.
