&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boxer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, pennant F121, was built as a [[Landing Ship, Tank]] (LST) at [[Harland and Wolff]]. Launched in December 1942 and commissioned the following April, she saw service as part of the [[Allies|Allied]] [[Allied invasion of Italy|invasion of Italy]].

==Design and development==
HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boxer&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the next in development of the Landing Ship, Tank following the conversion of the Maracaibo tankers into landing ships capable of carrying vehicles. The requirement was for a ship that could carry 13 [[Churchill tank]]s, 27 other vehicles and 193 men. As it was expected to have a high speed even when laden for the assault (about 18 knots) it could not have a shallow draught. This in turn meant that an extra long bow ramp had to be added. At {{convert|140|ft|m|abbr=on}} this took up a lot of room inside the ship.

Boxer had only two sister ships, as plans to build more in the United States led instead to a simpler though slower design capable of similar capacity but with a much shallower draught.

==Service==

In 1944, she was refitted as a &amp;quot;Fighter Direction Ship&amp;quot;, for use during the [[Normandy landings]], then as an &amp;quot;Action Information Organisation&amp;quot; tender&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://ndassoc.net/history/index.php?pg=1&amp;amp;PHPSESSID=ae16621e7c0e695ac1ee5c6747969729 Navigating and Direction Officers Association]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; (a [[radar]] training ship) in 1946. In 1953 she took part in the [[Fleet Review]] to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Souvenir Programme, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, HMSO, Gale and Polden&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was placed in reserve in 1956, and scrapped at [[Barrow-in-Furness]] in 1958.

HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boxer&amp;apos;&amp;apos; carried the writer/comedian [[Spike Milligan]] from North Africa to Italy when he served with the 56th Heavy Regiment Royal Artillery.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Milligan, Spike (1978) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mussolini, His Part In My Downfall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Hobbs, J.
