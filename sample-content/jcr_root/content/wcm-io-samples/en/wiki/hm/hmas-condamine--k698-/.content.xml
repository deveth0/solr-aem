&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMAS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Condamine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (K698/F698)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, named for the [[Condamine River]] in Queensland, was a [[River class frigate]] of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). Commissioned in 1946, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Condamine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; served in the Korean War. The ship was paid off in 1955, and sold for scrap in 1961.

==Construction==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Condamine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was laid down by the [[State Dockyard]] at [[Newcastle, New South Wales]] on 30 October 1943. She was launched on 4 November 1944, and commissioned into the RAN on 22 February 1946.

==Operational history==
During the first years of her career &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Condamine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; operated only in Australian and New Guinean waters.

From August 1952 to March 1953 the ship operated in Korean waters during the [[Korean War]]. During this deployment, she conducted a number of shore bombardments and protected [[United Nations]] forces on islands off the Korean peninsular. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Condamine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was awarded the [[battle honour]] &amp;quot;Korea 1952–53&amp;quot; for this deployment.&amp;lt;ref name=honourslist&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Units_entitlement_list.pdf |title=Royal Australian Navy Ship/Unit Battle Honours |date=1 March 2010 |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110614064156/http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Units_entitlement_list.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2011 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Following the end of the Korean War, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Condamine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; completed a second tour of Korean waters between February and November 1955.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Condamine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; paid off into reserve on 2 December 1955, and was sold for scrap on 21 September 1961.
