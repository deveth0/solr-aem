{{otherships|HMS Arab}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arab&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1896 to 1897 Programme) was a [[B class destroyer (1913)|B-class]] [[torpedo boat destroyer]] of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]]. She was laid down by [[J &amp;amp; G Thomson]] at [[Clydebank]] and completed by [[John Brown &amp;amp; Company]] who took over the yard.

She ran 9 trials between 11 March  and 27 May 1901, but only succeeded in reaching 30.5 knots (56&amp;amp;nbsp;km/h). Three thousand pounds were abated for failure to reach contract speed, the actual price paid being £63,642. After serving in home waters, was disposed of in 1919.
