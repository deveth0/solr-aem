{{otherships|HMS Gibraltar}}

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gibraltar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was an [[Edgar class cruiser|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Edgar&amp;apos;&amp;apos; class]] [[cruiser]] launched in 1892 for service in the [[Royal Navy]]. She was built and engineered by Messrs Napier of [[Glasgow]]. Of 7,700 loaded displacement, she was coal-fired with four double-ended cylindrical  boilers driving two shafts. She could make {{convert|20|kn|km/h}} with forced draught and {{convert|18|kn|km/h}} with natural draught. She was a very good sea boat and an exceptional steamer.

During her early career she served mainly on foreign stations. In late 1899 she had a complete refit at [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth dockyard]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp;amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Monday |date=1 January 1900 |page_number=7 |issue=36027| }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In March 1901 she was commissioned by Captain A. H. Limpus, with a complement of 544 officers and men, to take the place as [[flagship]] of [[Arthur Moore (Royal Navy officer)|Rear-Admiral Arthur Moore]], who had been appointed [[Cape of Good Hope Station|Commander-in-Chief on the Cape Station]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval &amp;amp; Military intelligence |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=6 March 1901 |page_number=10 |issue=36395| }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Despite her obsolescence, she saw service in World War I, first with the 10th Cruiser Squadron on Northern Patrol and from 1915 as a depot ship for this group, based in the [[Shetland Islands]].

Future [[First Sea Lord]] [[John H. D. Cunningham]] served aboard her as a midshipman.  Captain [[Ronald Arthur Hopwood]], R.N. was in command 1913â€“1914, leaving at the start of [[World War I]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gibraltar&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was sold in 1923.
