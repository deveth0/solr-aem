&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sceptre&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (P215)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a 1940-programme [[British S class submarine (1931)|S-class]] [[submarine]] of the [[Royal Navy]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on January 9, 1943, in [[Greenock]], although her keel had been laid down in July 1940.

==Career==
[[Image:SCEPTRE badge-1-.jpg|left|100px]]
In [[World War II]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sceptre&amp;apos;&amp;apos; joined the 3rd Submarine Flotilla in April 1943 and was based at [[Holy Loch]]. She then detached to [[Scapa Flow]] to be used for the Submarine [[Commanding Officer&amp;apos;s Qualifying Course]], the Perisher. Whilst exercising to the west of the [[Orkney Islands]], she was depth charged in error by the [[Royal Air Force]] and her hull was slightly buckled, which required docking for repairs.

After an uneventful first patrol, she was fitted with special towing gear and proceeded to [[Loch a&amp;apos; Chàirn Bhàin]]. Here she joined up with two [[British T class submarine|T-class]] and three [[British S class submarine (1931)|S-class]] submarines, together with the depot ships &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Titania&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bonadventure&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the latter being the depot ship for the [[X class submarine|X-craft midget submarines]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sceptre&amp;apos;&amp;apos; left Loch Cairnbawn on September 12, 1943, with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;X-10&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in tow. The aim was to attack the German [[battleship]] [[German battleship Tirpitz|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tirpitz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] at [[Gáivuotna–Kåfjord|Kåfjord]]. This attack was intended to remove the threat of the German battleship to convoys on their way to [[Russia]]. Six X-craft were used to attack shipping in the fjords, with the attack on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tirpitz&amp;apos;&amp;apos; putting her out of action for nearly a year.

In April 1944, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sceptre&amp;apos;&amp;apos; left for another &amp;quot;special operation&amp;quot; with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;X-24&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in tow. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;X-24&amp;apos;&amp;apos; penetrated [[Bergen]] harbour and sank the merchant ship [[SS Bärenfels (1921)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bärenfels&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] as well as damaging large sections of the floating dock in the harbour.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sceptre&amp;apos;&amp;apos; earned the title of &amp;quot;Bring them back alive&amp;quot; as she was the only towing submarine which lost none of the X-craft in her care. Commanded by Lieutenant I. S. McIntosh, MBE, DSC, throughout her short but active service career, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sceptre&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sank six ships &amp;amp;mdash; four merchant vessels of 14,393 gross register tons and two escorts of 1,444 displacement tons. This total and tonnage was unequalled by any other submarine in home waters during the period.

At the end of the war, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sceptre&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was disarmed, streamlined and given more powerful batteries to serve as a high speed target submarine. She was allocated to the Seventh Submarine Flotilla and used for training, based at [[Loch Alsh]]. She continued to run as a training unit based in [[Portland Harbour|Portland]] until February 1947. She was damaged by a battery explosion on 8 August 1949.  She was finally sold to the [[British Steel|British Iron and Steel Corporation]] for scrap in September 1949.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/3434.html HMS Sceptre], Uboat.net&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
