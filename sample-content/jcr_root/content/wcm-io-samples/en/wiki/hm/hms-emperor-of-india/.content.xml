&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Emperor of India&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an {{sclass-|Iron Duke|battleship|2}} of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]]. She was originally to have been named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Delhi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; but was renamed just a month before launching after [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], who was also [[Emperor of India]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Emperor of India&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was laid down on 31 May 1912 at [[Barrow-in-Furness]] by [[Vickers]]. She was launched on 27 November 1913 and commissioned on 10 November 1914.

Upon commissioning, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Emperor of India&amp;apos;&amp;apos; joined the [[1st Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|First Battle Squadron]] of the [[Grand Fleet]], based at [[Scapa Flow]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Emperor of India&amp;apos;&amp;apos; later joined the [[4th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|Fourth Battle Squadron]] and was [[flagship]] of Rear-Admiral [[Alexander Ludovic Duff|A. L. Duff]]. King George V visited &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Emperor of India&amp;apos;&amp;apos; while inspecting the Fleet at Scapa in July 1915.

She was in refit at [[Invergordon]] at the time of the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916. During Jutland, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Emperor of India&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was replaced as flagship of Admiral Duff by {{HMS|Superb|1907|2}}. In 1917, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Emperor of India&amp;apos;&amp;apos; replaced her sister ship {{HMS|Marlborough|1912|2}} as second flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Emperor of India&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was present at the surrender of the German [[High Seas Fleet]] in November 1918. She survived the cuts to the Royal Navy in the post-World War I climate and joined the [[British Mediterranean Fleet|Mediterranean Fleet]] in 1919.

She was decommissioned in 1929 and was sunk as a [[target ship]] on 1 September 1931. She was raised the following year and sold for scrap on 6 February 1932.
