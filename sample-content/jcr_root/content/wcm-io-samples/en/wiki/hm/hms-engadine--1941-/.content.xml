&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Engadine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a 9,909 ton [[cargo ship]] laid down at the [[Greenock Dockyard Company]], [[Greenock]], [[Scotland]] on 16 March 1940, [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 26 May 1941 and completed on 17 November 1941.

She was originally built for the [[Clan Line]], and named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Clan Buchanan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the previous &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Clan Buchanan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; having been sunk by the [[Germany|German]] raider {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Pinguin||2}} on 28 April 1941). However she was taken over by the British [[Royal Navy]] before completion and renamed in honour of the first {{HMS|Engadine|1911|6}} for use as a seaplane depot ship.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web

}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

She was loaned to the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] from November 1942 until July 1943. At the end of the war, she was sold back to the Clan Line in 1946 and reverted to her original name.  The ship was eventually scrapped at [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], [[Spain]] in  November 1962.
