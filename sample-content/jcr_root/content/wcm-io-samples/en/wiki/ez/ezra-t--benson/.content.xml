&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ezra Taft Benson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 22, 1811 &amp;amp;ndash; September 3, 1869) (commonly referred to as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ezra T. Benson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to distinguish him from his [[Ezra Taft Benson|great-grandson]] of the same name) was as an [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] and a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).

==Early life==
Benson was born in [[Mendon, Massachusetts]], the son of John Benson and Chloe Taft. His father moved to a farm in [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]] in 1817 where he lived for at least 16 of the next 18 years. Benson married Pamelia Andrus of [[Northbridge, Massachusetts|Northbridge]] on January 1, 1832, at Uxbridge. They lived at Uxbridge for the next three years, between 1832 and 1835. He also had lived in Northbridge, on his sister&amp;apos;s farm in 1830 and 1831.  He and Pamela had  children, one of  whom died here at Uxbridge in 1833. He managed a hotel in the center of Uxbridge and made a considerable sum of money which he invested in a cotton mill at [[Holland, Massachusetts]], before moving West.

==Joins the Latter-day Saint movement==
Benson, along with his wife, was baptized into the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] on July 19, 1840 in [[Quincy, Illinois]].  He had moved to Quincy previously, and first met members of the church when they came there at the time they were driven out of [[Missouri]].  In April 1841 the Bensons moved to [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]].  On April 27, 1844 Benson married a second wife, Adeline Brooks Andrus, the sister of Pamelia.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Dew, Sherri. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ezra Taft Benson: A Biography&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1987) p. 4&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Benson was ordained to the office of apostle on July 16, 1846. He replaced [[John E. Page]] in the Quorum of the Twelve.

==Missionary service==
Benson served as a church [[Mormon missionary|missionary]] in the United States and in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]].

His first mission in the 1840s took him to his birthplace of Mendon, Massachusetts.  On this journey he also preached in [[Chambersburg, Illinois]].  During his second mission he was in [[New Jersey]] serving with [[John Pack]] when they received news of Joseph Smith&amp;apos;s murder.  From December 1844 to May 1845 Benson served another mission during which he served as president of the Boston [[District (LDS Church)|Conference]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Dew. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Benson&amp;apos;. p. 4-5&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Plural marriages, later career==
Like many early Latter Day Saints, Benson practiced [[plural marriage]]. Benson later married Adeline Brooks Andrus, Desdemona Fullmer (widow of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]]), Eliza Ann Perry, Lucinda West, Elizabeth Gollaher, Olive Mary Knight, and Mary Larsen. Benson had a total of eight wives and 35 children. He served in the [[Utah Territory|Utah Territorial Legislature]] and died in [[Ogden, Utah]].
Benson&amp;apos;s great-grandson, also named [[Ezra Taft Benson]], also became an [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] of the LDS Church; the younger Benson served as [[U.S. Secretary of Agriculture]] in the 1950s and [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|president of the LDS Church]] in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Burial==
Benson is buried in the [[Logan, Utah]] Cemetery.
