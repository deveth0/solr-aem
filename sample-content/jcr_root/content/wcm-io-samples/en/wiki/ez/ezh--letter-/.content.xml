&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ezh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{unicode|Ʒ ʒ}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), has its small letter used in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), representing the [[voiced postalveolar fricative]] consonant. It is also called the &amp;quot;tailed z&amp;quot;.  Example: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;vision&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɪ|ʒ|ən}}. It is pronounced as the &amp;quot;s&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;treasure&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;si&amp;quot; in the word &amp;quot;precision&amp;quot;.  (See also the [[Persian alphabet]] letter [[Že|ژ]] and the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] [[Zhe (Cyrillic)|ж]].)

Ezh is used as a letter in some orthographies of [[Skolt Sami]], both by itself, and with a [[caron]] ({{Unicode|[[Ǯ]] ǯ}}). These denote partially voiced alveolar and post-alveolar [[affricate]]s, respectively, broadly represented /dz/. It also appears in the orthography of some African languages, for example in the [[Aja language (Niger-Congo)|Aja language]] of [[Benin]] and the [[Daghbani]] language of [[Ghana]], where the uppercase variant looks like a reflected sigma ([[Sigma|Σ]]).

==Origin==
{{further|tailed z}}
As a phonetic symbol, ezh originates with [[Isaac Pitman]]&amp;apos;s alphabet in 1847, as a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;z&amp;apos;&amp;apos; with an added hook. The symbol is based on [[Gothic minuscule|medieval cursive]] forms of Latin [[z]], evolving into the [[blackletter]] z letter. In Unicode, however, the blackletter &amp;apos;&amp;apos;z&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  (&amp;quot;[[tailed z]]&amp;quot;, German &amp;apos;&amp;apos;geschwänztes Z&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is considered a glyph variant of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;z&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and not an ezh.

In contexts where &amp;quot;tailed z&amp;quot; is used in contrast to tail-less &amp;apos;&amp;apos;z&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, notably in standard transcription of [[Middle High German]], Unicode {{unicode|ʒ}} is sometimes used, strictly speaking incorrectly. Unicode offers  {{unicode|[[ȥ]]}} &amp;quot;z with hook&amp;quot; as a grapheme for Middle High German coronal fricative instead.

== Ezh as an abbreviation for dram ==
In [[Unicode]], a standard designed to allow symbols from all writing systems to be represented and manipulated by computers, the ezh (alternatively &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ℨ&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is used as the symbol to represent the abbreviation for [[dram (unit)|dram]], an [[apothecaries&amp;apos; system]] [[units of measurement|unit]] of [[mass]].

== Ezh and yogh ==
In Unicode 1.0, the character was unified with the unrelated character [[yogh]] ({{lang|ang|Ȝ ȝ}}), which was not correctly added to Unicode until Unicode 3.0. Historically, ezh is derived from Latin [[z]], while yogh is derived from Latin [[g]] by way of [[insular G]]. The characters do look very similar, and do not appear alongside each other in any alphabet. To better differentiate between the two, the [[Oxford University Press]] and the [[Early English Text Society]] extend the uppermost tip of the &amp;apos;yogh&amp;apos; into a little curvature upward.

== Ezh and the digit three ==
The capital ezh looks similar to the common form of the [[3 (number)|figure three]] (3). To differentiate between the two characters, Ezh includes the sharp zigzag of the letter z, while the number is usually curved.

Still, there is a slightly different form of the Arabic numeral three called banker&amp;apos;s three, which looks like the ezh. Its origin is that bankers did not want forgers to turn the 3&amp;apos;s in a check into 8&amp;apos;s, so the top is angled.

== Ezh and hiragana ro ==
[[Image:ろ-bw.png|thumb|right|280x60px|Stroke order in writing ろ]]Ezh looks similar to [[Ro (kana)|ろ]], the Japanese hiragana letter for the [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]] &amp;quot;ro&amp;quot;. However, the central corner of ろ points out further away to the left than that of ezh.

Furthermore, the hiragana for &amp;quot;ru&amp;quot; is る, appearing identical to ろ except for the spiral at the end.
