&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yehudai ben Nahman&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yehudai Gaon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; [[Hebrew]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;יהודאי גאון&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, sometimes: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yehudai b. Nahman&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was the head of the [[yeshiva]] in [[Sura (city)|Sura]] from 757 to 761, during the [[Geonim|Gaonic]] period of [[Judaism]]. He was originally a member of the academy of [[Pumbedita]], but the [[exilarch]] Solomon ben Hisdai appointed him as Gaon of Sura as &amp;quot;there is no one there (at Sura) as distinguished as he is for wisdom&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Letter of [[Sherira Gaon]].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He waged a strong campaign, continued by his disciple [[Pirkoi ben Bavoi]], for the acceptance of the Babylonian [[Talmud]] as the standard for Jewish law in all countries.  This was opposed by the Jews of [[Eretz Yisrael]], who relied on the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] and their own older traditions.  Yehudai argued that, as a result of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] persecution, the Jews of Eretz Yisrael had only preserved Jewish tradition in a fragmentary and unreliable form.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;See &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Iggeret Pirkoi ben Bavoi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Louis Ginzberg|Ginzberg]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Geonica&amp;apos;&amp;apos; pp. 48-53;  idem, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ginze Schechter&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, pp. 544-573; Lewin, Tarbiz vol. 2 pp. 383-405; Mann, R.E.J. vol. 20 pp. 113-148.  It is reprinted in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Toratan shel Geonim&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Works==
He was author of the book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Halachot Pesukot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which discusses those [[halachah|halachot]] that were practiced in the [[Diaspora]] since the destruction of the [[Second Temple]]. The text, which is generally organized along the same pattern as the tractates of the [[Babylonian Talmud]], was the subject of many abridgements and summaries.  The original was lost for many years, and was only known in the form of a Hebrew paraphrase called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hilchot Re&amp;apos;u&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (published [http://hebrewbooks.org/31931 Versailles 1886]), until it was discovered in a Yemenite manuscript and published in [http://hebrewbooks.org/31930 Jerusalem in 1950].


==Halachoth Gedoloth==
{{main|Halachot Gedolot}}

One current of rabbinic and scholarly opinion also credits him with authorship of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Halachot Gedolot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or of the core of it, though it is generally agreed that the final form of that work is to be attributed to [[Simeon Kayyara]].  Based on anachronistic discrepancies, the [[smag]]&amp;apos;s opinion that it was Rav Yehudai Gaon who composed the work halachoth gedoloth was thought to be an error.  Rabbi [[David Gans]] may have been the first to suggest that in was in fact &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rav Yehudai Hakohen be Ahunai gaon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the [[Sura Academy]] (served 4519 - 4524 on the [[hebrew calendar]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;igerret of rav shrirah gaon&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) who is the gaon whom the smag intended as it&amp;apos;s composer&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Tzemach Dovid to year 5000, p. 46, vol. 1, (Warsaw 5638 Hebrew Calendar)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;.

At all events the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Halachot Pesukot&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an important source for the larger work.
