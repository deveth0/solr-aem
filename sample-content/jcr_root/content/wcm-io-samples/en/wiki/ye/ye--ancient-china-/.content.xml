&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ye&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yecheng&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|t=鄴城|s=邺城|p=Yèchéng|w=Yeh&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-ch&amp;apos;eng&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;}}) was an ancient Chinese city located in what is now [[Linzhang]] County, [[Handan]], [[Hebei]] province and neighbouring [[Anyang]], [[Henan]] province.

Ye was first built in the [[Spring and Autumn Period]] by [[Duke Huan of Qi]], and by the time of the [[Warring States Period]] the city belonged to the state of [[Wei (state)|Wei]].  Ye was a political and economic center of China during the [[Three Kingdoms Period]] and [[Northern Dynasties]]. It served as the military headquarters of the warlords [[Yuan Shao]] and [[Cao Cao]] in the last years of the [[Han Dynasty|Eastern Han Dynasty]] and later as the capital of the [[Eastern Wei Dynasty]] and [[Northern Qi Dynasty]]. The city was razed to the ground in 580, after [[Yang Jian]], founder of the [[Sui Dynasty]], defeated a resistance force led by [[Yuchi Jiong]], which used Ye as a base of operations. Extensive excavations of the city have been made in recent years, allowing Chinese historians to make detailed plans of the site.

In 2012, archaeologists unearthed nearly 3,000 [[Buddha]] statues during a dig outside of Ye. Most of the statues are made of white marble and limestone, and could date back to the Eastern Wei and Northern Qi dynasties 534-577 CE).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/04/pictures/120417-3000-ancient-buddhas-china-world-science/ | title = Pictures: 3,000 Ancient Buddhas Unearthed in China | publisher = National Geographic | date = 2012-04-17 | accessdate = 2012-04-20 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
