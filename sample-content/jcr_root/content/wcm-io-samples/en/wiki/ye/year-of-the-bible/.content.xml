        text="&lt;p&gt;In the [[United States]], 1983 was designated as the national &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Year of the Bible&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] by Proclamation 5018, made on February 3, 1983 at the annual [[National Prayer Breakfast]].  President Reagan was authorized and requested to so designate 1983 by Public Law 97-280 (Senate Joint Resolution 165], 96 Stat. 1211) passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] and approved on October 4, 1982.

The law recited that [[the Bible]] &amp;quot;has made a unique contribution in shaping the United States as a distinctive and blessed nation and people&amp;quot; and that, quoting President Jackson, the Bible is &amp;quot;the rock on which our Republic rests&amp;quot;. It also acknowledged a “national need to study and apply the teachings of the Holy Scriptures.” “Can we resolve to reach, learn and try to heed the greatest message ever written, God’s Word, and the Holy Bible?” Reagan asked. “Inside its pages lie all the answers to all the problems that man has ever known.”

On May 7, 2009, Rep. [[Paul Broun| Paul Broun Jr.]] [R-GA10] sponsored House concurrent resolution 121 (of the 111th Congress), which would have encouraged the president to declare 2010 as &amp;quot;The National Year of the Bible&amp;quot; and to &amp;quot;issue a proclamation calling upon citizens of all faiths to rediscover and apply the priceless, timeless message of the Holy Scripture which has profoundly influenced and shaped the United States&amp;quot;. The resolution died in a referral to committee.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web
