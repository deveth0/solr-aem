&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yetbarak&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Emperor of Ethiopia|{{unicode|nəgusä nägäst}}]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of [[Ethiopia]], and a member of the [[Zagwe dynasty]]. According to [[Taddesse Tamrat]], he was the son of [[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Taddesse Tamrat, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Church and State in Ethiopia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), p. 56n.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
Tradition states that Yetbarak ascended to the throne after his father King Lalibela had taken the crown away from his first choice of successor, Yetbarak&amp;apos;s cousin [[Na&amp;apos;akueto La&amp;apos;ab]]. Taddesse Tamrat argues that this tradition is based on an official version of events, and theorizes that Na&amp;apos;akueto La&amp;apos;ab had fought with Yetbarak for the throne, and despite initial success Yetbarak became king in the end.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Taddesse Tamrat, pp. 62-4.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Taddesse Tamrat also suggests that Yetbarak was the same individual known in the &amp;quot;official hagiographical tradition&amp;quot; as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Za-Ilmaknun&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the king of the Zagwe dynasty whom [[Yekuno Amlak of Ethiopia|Yekuno Amlak]] killed and succeeded. Tamrat notes that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Za-Ilmaknun&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is translated as &amp;quot;The Unknown, the hidden one&amp;quot;, an &amp;quot;esoteric term&amp;quot; that has &amp;quot;become a useful escape mechanism in denying that the king killed by Yikunno-&#x60;Amlak had anything to do with [[Lasta]].&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Taddesse Tamrat, p. 68 n. 1.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
