Rabbi &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yekusiel Yehuda Teitelbaum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1808–1883), known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yetev Lev&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Rebbe]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Austria-Hungary]].

==Early life and education==
He was the son of Rabbi [[Elazar Nison Teitelbaum]], rabbi of [[Drohobych|Drubitsh]], who was the son of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Yismach Moshe]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Rabbi Moshe Teitelbaum. Renowned [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis are sometimes known by the titles of their religious works) of [[Sátoraljaújhely|Ujhel]], [[Hungary]].

==Career==
After his studies, Yekusiel Yehuda, also known by his [[Yiddish]] equivalent names as Zalman Leib, was appointed as the rabbi of [[Stropkov]] (1833). He moved to Ujhel (1841) and then to Drubitsh (1856). When the Jewish community in the city of [[Sighet]], [[Hungary]], was looking for a new rabbi, he was invited by the heads of the community&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1202&amp;amp;st=&amp;amp;pgnum=7|title=בית סיגט ואוהל|work=HebrewBooks.org|language=[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]|accessdate=Feb/14/13}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and was appointed to that post in 1858. He also served as a hasidic &amp;apos;&amp;apos;rebbe&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and became known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;rebbe of [[Ujhel-Siget (Hasidic dynasty)|Siget]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

== Family life ==
Yekusiel Yehuda Tetelbaum married Ruchl, a daughter of Rabbi Moshe Dovid Ashkenazi of [[Toltsva]] and his wife. Their sons were [[Chananya Yom Tov Lipa Teitelbaum|Chananya Yomtov Lipa]], author of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kedishas Yomtov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, who succeeded his father in Siget; Avrohom Aharon, who became the rabbi of [[Kolbasov]]; Moshe Yosef, the rabbi of Ujhel; and Eliyohu Betsalel, rabbi of Tetsh ([[Tyachiv]], Ukraine) (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;see: [[Tetsh (Hasidic dynasty)]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). Yekusiel and Ruchl Teitelbaum also had three daughters.

Among the descendants of Yekusiel and Ruchl was their grandson Rabbi [[Joel Teitelbaum]], the rebbe of [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], who emigrated to the [[United States]] after [[the Holocaust]].

Reb Boruch of [[Gorlice|Gorlitz]], son of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Divrei Chaim&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of [[Sanz (Hasidic dynasty)|Sanz]], married one of their daughters. A great-grandson of Teitelbaum&amp;apos;s from that marriage was Rabbi [[Yekusiel Yehudah Halberstam]] of [[Klausenburg (Hasidic dynasty)|Klausenberg]].

== Teachings and published works ==
Yekusiel Yehuda was the author of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yetev Lev&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a Hasidic commentary on the [[Torah]], which he originally published anonymously; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yetev Ponim&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on the [[Jewish holiday]]s,  and the [[responsa]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Avnei Tsedek&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://hebrewbooks.org/659|title=Avnei Tzedek|year=1885|work=HebrewBooks.org|location=[[Lvov]]|accessdate=Feb/14/13}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rav Tuv&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
