&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yellowdine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is located 402&amp;amp;nbsp;km east of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]] on the [[Great Eastern Highway]]. The townsite is in the [[Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia|goldfields region]], situated in the [[Shire of Yilgarn]].

== History ==
The town was initially planned in 1895 as a railway siding along the Coolgardie to Southern Cross railway line that was opened in 1896. Once gold was discovered at [[Mount Palmer, Western Australia|Mount Palmer]] close to Yellowdine in 1934 the government began to develop the siding as a town-site that was later gazetted in 1935.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{LandInfo WA|y|Y|2007-06-08}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
The name of the town is believed to be Aboriginal in origin, a misspelling of Yelladine, although its meaning is unknown.
