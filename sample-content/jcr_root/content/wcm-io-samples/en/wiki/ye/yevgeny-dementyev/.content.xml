&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yevgeny Alexandrovich Dementyev&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Евге́ний Деме́нтьев}}, born 17 January 1983 in [[Tayozhny, Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug|Tayozhny]], [[Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug]]) is a [[Russia]]n cross-country skier. He attended [[Children and Youth Sports School]] of [[Sovetsky District, Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug|Sovetsky District]], Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug, where his first trainer was Valery Ukhov. Dementyev&amp;apos;s first international success was in 2001 at the Junior World Championship.

He also won two medals at the 2003 Nordic skiing World Junior Championships with a gold in 10&amp;amp;nbsp;km and a bronze in the 30&amp;amp;nbsp;km. Dementyev has two 4×10&amp;amp;nbsp;km medals at the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships]] with a silver in 2007 and a bronze in 2005. His best individual finish at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships was 22nd in the 15&amp;amp;nbsp;km&amp;amp;nbsp;+ 15&amp;amp;nbsp;km double pursuit in 2005.

On 25 August 2009, Russian newssite russiatoday.com reported that Dementyev has tested positive for recombinant erythropoietin (EPO). He returned in 2011 after a two year ban.
