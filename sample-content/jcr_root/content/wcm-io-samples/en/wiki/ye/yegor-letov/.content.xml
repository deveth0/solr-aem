&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Igor Fyodorovich &amp;quot;Yegor&amp;quot; Letov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|И́горь Фёдорович (Его́р) Ле́тов}}; 10 September 1964, [[Omsk]] – 19 February 2008, Omsk) was a [[Russians|Russian]] musician, poet, and conceptual art painter, mostly known as the founder and leader of the [[punk rock]]/[[psychedelic rock]] band [[Grazhdanskaya Oborona]] (Civil Defence). He was also the founder of the conceptual art project named &amp;quot;Communism&amp;quot; mocking Soviet propaganda style (samples of speeches of Soviet leaders, Russian patriotic songs, propaganda slogans etc. were often used in their compositions) and played with [[Siberia]]n singer-songwriter [[Yanka Dyagileva]]. Yegor Letov was also a cofounder of [[National Bolshevik Party]].

Certainly a prolific musician, Letov is a controversial figure. He was controversial in the mid-to-late 1980s when he satirized the Soviet system, and helped develop a gritty Soviet punk sound with folk underpinnings. After the fall of the USSR and especially [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]] he disappointed in [[Yeltsin]]&amp;apos;s government and made friends and fans out of nationalists and communists. In later years, Letov distanced himself from any political ideology, stating (in 2004) &amp;quot;We&amp;apos;re [[patriotism|patriots]], but not [[Nazism|Nazis]]. ... All the [[totalitarianism|totalitarians]] - right, left, of all colors and stripes - fuck you.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.gr-oborona.ru/pub/pub/1090486302.html Official statement from Ye. Letov and Grazhdanskaya Oborona on the events in Yekaterinburg]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In an interview, Letov expressed that his favorite poets were [[Alexander Vvedensky (poet)|Alexander Vvedensky]] (1904–1941), one of the [[OBERIU]] writers, and [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]. He also expressed his interest in Conceptualism, and spoke of his own work in punk music and in creating a public image as a work of conceptual performance art.

In 1997 Letov married the bass guitarist of [[Grazhdanskaya Oborona]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Natalya Chumakova&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; they had no children.

Yegor Letov died of [[heart failure]] in his sleep on 19 February 2008 at home in [[Omsk]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.russia-ic.com/news/show/5805 Cult Rock Musician Egor Letov Died], 19.02.2008&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20101215024309/http://exile.ru/blog/detail.php?BLOG_ID=17090 Punk Legend Yegor Letov dies of heart failure] 21.02.2008 [[The eXile]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was 43 years old.
