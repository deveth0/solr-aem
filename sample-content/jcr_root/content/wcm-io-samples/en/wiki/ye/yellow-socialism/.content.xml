        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yellow socialism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has two meanings. It is primarily a system of government devised by [[Pierre Biétry]] in 1904, that offers the working classes a contrasting alternative to &amp;quot;red socialism&amp;quot; ([[Marxism]]).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Payne, Stanley. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A History of Fascism, 1914-1945.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Routledge, 1996. pp. 46.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was prominent in the early twentieth century prior to [[World War I]], competing with Marxism for the minds of the workers. After this point, this movement became absorbed into [[fascism]], and the previously developed [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian national socialism]] which from 1920 developed into [[Nazism]].

This philosophy entailed workers striving to be part of a capitalist system, forming unions that were equal with groups of companies (similar to [[corporatism]]). Workers were to share in company profits more greatly through negotiation between these two groups. The philosophy proposed that above this should lie a strong autocratic state.

However, the term was appropriated by [[Marxists]] to describe self-described socialists who were seen by Marxists as on the side of the ruling class; all non-Marxists considering themselves socialists (&amp;quot;[[Marxist revisionism|revisionists]]&amp;quot;), whether they identified with the label or not. This usage included many whose ideas would later be known as [[social democracy]] and [[democratic socialism]], very different concepts to that devised by Biétry.

==History==
The term &amp;quot;yellow socialism&amp;quot; was coined by a former member of the [[French Socialist Party]], [[Pierre Biétry]], in 1904 when he founded the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Fédération nationale des Jaunes de France]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;National Federation of Yellows of France&amp;quot;). Later, affiliated Swiss and German &amp;quot;yellow&amp;quot; groups formed. This movement was strongly opposed to Marxism.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Mandal, U.C. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dictionary Of Public Administration.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Ivy Publishing House, 2008. pp. 560.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the [[United States]], yellow socialism was associated with the [[business unionism]] of [[Samuel Gompers]] (and thus described as &amp;quot;yellow unionism&amp;quot;). Business unionism was centered on the belief that the workers&amp;apos; best option was to form a labour cartel within a [[capitalism|capitalist]] society.

Yellow socialists and yellow unionists were criticized by Marxists for their [[nationalism]] and perceived occasional engagement in [[chauvinism]] such as opposition to [[immigration]] (for flooding the labour market and reducing wages or denying jobs to native-born citizens), and sometimes even [[racism]] including [[anti-Semitism]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Griffin, Roger. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Nature of Fascism.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Routledge, 1993. pp. 92-93.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Kaplan, Barbara Hockey. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Social Change in the Capitalist World Economy.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Sage Publications, 1978. pp. 81.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In Europe, during [[World War I]], Marxists associated the [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties with yellow socialism, as they supported their own states in the war rather than taking an internationalist position against the conflict. However, such parties had no connection to Biétry&amp;apos;s thinking.

The &amp;quot;[[Berne International]]&amp;quot;, formed in [[Zimmerwald conference|Zimmerwald]] in 1915, was similarly described as &amp;quot;yellow socialist&amp;quot; by [[Lenin]] for its rejection of revolutionary socialism, despite its opposition to the war.[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1919/jul/14.htm]

After [[World War I]] the term &amp;quot;yellow socialism&amp;quot; fell into disuse.
