&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yes L.A.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a one-sided silkscreened picture EP released in 1979 (see [[1979 in music]]) on [[Dangerhouse Records]] (catalog number EW-79) featuring Los Angeles based [[punk rock]] bands [[Black Randy and the Metrosquad]], Eyes, [[The Bags (Los Angeles band)|Bags]], [[The Alley Cats (Los Angeles punk band)|The Alley Cats]], [[X (U.S. band)|X]] and [[The Germs|Germs]]. The title is a parody of the seminal [[No Wave]] compilation album released a year earlier, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[No New York]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and even went as far as including the disclaimer, &amp;quot;Not produced by [[Brian Eno]]&amp;quot; on the record. The record has become highly sought after by record collectors.

2000 copies of the record were produced with several different color combinations available, among them Brown/Green, Blue/Green, Black/Green and Red/Green. Even scarcer are a few copies (the exact number is unknown) that were misprinted, as the background images were put on by hand. Examples include copies with text only, with the background image in front of the text, or the image and text on the side with the grooves (rendering this misprint unplayable).

Original copies came with no sleeve in a clear bag with a cardboard backing. Some test copies on black vinyl are known to exist.
