&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yenipazar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a town and a small district of [[Aydın Province]] in the [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean]] region of [[Turkey]], {{convert|45|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the city of [[Aydın]] on the road to Denizli.

Yenipazar itself is a quiet rural town of 6,423 people providing high schools and other facilities to the surrounding district, although in the last two decades the population has declined as people move to Turkey&amp;apos;s larger cities for higher education and careers. The local cuisine includes a delicious flat-bread pizza called [[pide]]. [[Adnan Menderes University]] has a school here offering diplomas in banking and finance, and the student population has brought Yenipazar more bars and other social amenities than you would expect from a town of this size.
