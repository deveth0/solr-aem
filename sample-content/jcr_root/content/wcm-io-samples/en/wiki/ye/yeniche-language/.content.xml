The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yeniche&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; language, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jenisch&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[German language|German]] spoken by the [[Yeniche people|Yeniche]], former [[nomad]]s living mostly in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], and parts of [[France]].

== Components ==
The Yeniche language has been documented since the 18th century. It is a [[jargon]] rather than an actual language; meaning, it consists of a significant number of unique specialized words, but does not have its own grammar or its own basic vocabulary. Yeniche speakers generally speak their local German dialect enriched by the Yeniche vocabulary.

The Yeniche vocabulary contains many words of [[Romani language|Romani]] and [[Yiddish]] (and through this route, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) origin; it also has many unusual metaphors and metonomies that replace the standard German words. The relationship between Yeniche and standard German is comparable to the relationship between [[Cockney]] or [[Polari]] and standard English. Many original Yeniche words have become parts of standard German.

The Yeniche were originally travelers, i.e. people with professions outside of mainstream society that required them to move from town to town, such as showpeople, [[tinker]]s, and door-to-door salespeople. Today, the Yeniche jargon is only used in certain isolated locations; for example, in certain poor districts of cities such as [[Berlin]] and [[Münster]], few [[Eifel]] villages, [[Luxembourg]] etc.

Individual variants of the Yeniche language can be quite distinct, and have names of their own, such as [[Masematte]], [[Lepper Talp]], [[Heenese Vlek]], and many more.
