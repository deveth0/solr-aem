&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yeniçağa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a town and a district of [[Bolu Province]] in the [[Black Sea Region, Turkey|Black Sea]] region of [[Turkey]], 38 km from the town of [[Bolu]], on the highway from [[Istanbul]] to [[Ankara]]. It covers an area of 225 km², and the population (2000) is 10,800 of which 5,953 live in the town of Yeniçağa. Elevation is about 1200 m. The mayor is Ahmet Kızıltan ([[Felicity Party|SP]]).

The district is on the inland side of Bolu Mountain and has a cold, hard, dry inland climate; the countryside is pine-forested on the northern and western parts of the district whereas the south-eastern parts are sparsely wooded hills.

Yeniçağa is a small town providing basic infrastructure to the surrounding countryside, and successive generations have migrated to large cities in Turkey or abroad in search of jobs and careers. There are a large number of roadside restaurants, gas stations and repair shops along the old E5 Istanbul highway, these are mainly used by trucks as cars zoom by on the newer [[TEM motorway]]. Yeniçağa Lake is a popular spot for picnics under the trees on the lakeshore.
There is an annual country fair (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;panayır&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).
