        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yellowmead Down&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; near [[Sheepstor]] in [[Devon]], England, is a [[Bronze Age]] [[concentric stone circle]] consisting of four rings of stones set within one another. The largest is 20m wide and the smallest, 6m.

They once encircled a burial [[cairn]] although this is now barely visible. To the south west, several possible [[stone row]]s lead away, crossed by a post-medieval [[leat]] that once served a nearby [[Dartmoor tin-mining|tin]]works.

The site was excavated and restored by Rev. H Breton in 1921. In 2008 geophysical surveys and a small excavation were carried out to determine whether the restoration of 1921 had been performed accurately (it had), and to discover whether additional features remain buried in the peat. Fallen stones were found in line with some of the stone rows, suggesting that further features may lie downslope below the leat.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Armstrong2009&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=Kayt|date=Spring 2009|title=Yellowmead Stone Circles, Sheepstor|journal=Dartmoor Magazine|publisher=Edgemoor Publishing Ltd|location=Okehampton|issue=94|pages=35â€“36}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
