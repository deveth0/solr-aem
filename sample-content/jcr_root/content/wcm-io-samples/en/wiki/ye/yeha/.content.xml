The oldest standing structure in Ethiopia is located in Yeha: the temple of Yeha. This is a tower built in the [[Sabaean]] style, and dated through comparison with ancient structures in [[South Arabia]] to around [[709–700 BC|700 BC]]. Although no [[radiocarbon dating]] testing has been performed on samples from site, this date for the Great Tower is supported by local inscriptions.&amp;lt;ref name=Phillipson-36&amp;gt;David W. Phillipson, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ancient Churches of Ethiopia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009), p. 36&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[David Phillipson]] attributes its &amp;quot;excellent preservation&amp;quot; to two factors, &amp;quot;the care with which its original builders ensured a level   foundation, firmly placed on the uneven bedrock; and to its rededication -- perhaps as early as the sixth century  AD -- for use as a Christian church.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=Phillipson-36/&amp;gt; Two other archeological sites at Yeha include [[Grat Beal Gebri]], a ruined complex distinguished by a [[portico]] 10 meters wide and two sets of square [[column|pillar]]s, and a graveyard containing several rock-hewn shaft tombs first investigated in the early 1960s. One authority has speculated that one of these tombs contained a royal burial, while another believes the ancient residential area was likely one kilometer to the east of the modern village.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Phillipson, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ancient Churches&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, pp. 32, 37&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Yeha is also the location of an [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] monastery, founded according to tradition by Abba Aftse, one of the [[Nine Saints]]. In his account of Ethiopia, [[Francisco Álvares]] mentions visiting this town in 1520 (which he called &amp;quot;Abbafaçem&amp;quot;), and provides a description of the ancient tower, the monastery, and the local church.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Francisco Alvarez, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Prester John of the Indies&amp;apos;&amp;apos; translated by C. F. Beckingham and G. W. B. Huntingford (Cambridge: [[Hakluyt Society]], 1961), pp. 140f&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This church was either the rededicated Great Temple, or a now destroyed building which the [[Deutsche Aksum-Expedition]] described in the early 20th century. (The current structure, which exhibits Aksumite architectural features, was built between 1948 and 1949.)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Phillipson, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ancient Churches&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p. 37&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Yeha has also been the site of a number of archaeological excavations, beginning in 1952 by the [[Ethiopian Institute of Archeology]]. Although interrupted during the [[Derg]] regime, excavations were resumed in 1993 by a French archaeological team.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
