The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yemen Arab Republic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (YAR; in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: الجمهوريّة العربية اليمنية &amp;apos;&amp;apos;al-Jamhūrīyah al-&#x60;Arabīyah al-Yamanīyah&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;North Yemen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yemen (Sana&amp;apos;a)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was a country from 1962 to 1990 in the northwestern part of what is now [[Yemen]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The [[United States]] extended diplomatic recognition to the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen) on 19 December 1962, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Times&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 20 December 1962.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Its capital was at [[Sana&amp;apos;a]]. It united with the [[South Yemen|People&amp;apos;s Democratic Republic of Yemen]], commonly known as South Yemen, on May 22, 1990, to form the current [[Republic of Yemen]].

==History==
{{norefs|section|date=February 2012}}
Following the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]], northern Yemen became an independent [[Sovereign state|state]] as the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]]. On 27 September 1962, revolutionaries inspired by the [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] [[ideology]] of [[United Arab Republic]] ([[Egypt]]ian) President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] deposed the newly-crowned King [[Muhammad al-Badr]], took control of Sana&amp;apos;a, and established the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR). This [[coup d&amp;apos;état]] marked the beginning of the [[North Yemen Civil War]] that pitted YAR troops assisted by the United Arab Republic (Egypt) while [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Jordan]] supported Badr&amp;apos;s royalist forces opposing the newly formed republic. Conflict continued periodically until 1967 when Egyptian troops were withdrawn. By 1968, following a final royalist siege of Sana&amp;apos;a, most of the opposing leaders reached a reconciliation; Saudi Arabia recognized the Republic in 1970.

Unlike [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]] or [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], the YAR and its southern neighbour, the People&amp;apos;s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY), also known as [[South Yemen]], remained relatively friendly, though relations were often strained. In 1972 it was declared unification would eventually occur. However, these plans were put on hold in 1979, and war was only prevented by an [[Arab League]] intervention. The goal of unity was reaffirmed by the northern and southern heads of state during a summit meeting in [[Kuwait]] in March 1979. What the PDRY government failed to tell the YAR government was that it wished to be the dominant power in any unification, and left-wing [[Rebellion|rebels]] in North Yemen began to receive extensive [[funding]] and [[weapon|arms]] from South Yemen.

== Reunification ==

In May 1988, the YAR and PDRY governments came to an understanding that considerably reduced tensions including agreement to renew discussions concerning unification, to establish a joint oil exploration area along their undefined border, to demilitarize the border, and to allow Yemenis unrestricted border passage on the basis of only a national identification card.
