&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yeshiva of Far Rockaway&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yeshiva Derech Ayson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-he-n|יְשִׁיבָה דֶרֶךְ אֵיתָן}}) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Derech Ayson Rabbinical Seminary&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] [[yeshiva]] located on 802 Hicksville Road, [[Far Rockaway, Queens]] in [[New York City]]. It comprises a [[high school]] and [[Beth midrash|beis medrash]], or seminary. The school was founded by the current [[rosh yeshiva]], Rabbi [[Yechiel Perr|Yechiel Yitzchok Perr]], and by the late Rabbi [[Nachman Bulman]].  It is reputed for its intensive [[Talmud]]ic studies, and for the rosh yeshiva&amp;apos;s [[musar movement|musar]] lectures in the [[Novardok yeshiva|Novardok]] tradition.

== History ==
Rabbi Perr, an alumnus of Yeshiva Beis Yosef-Novardok in Brooklyn, [[Beth Medrash Govoha]], the [[Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia]], and Mesivta [[Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin]], founded the Yeshiva of Far Rockaway in 1969. The name of the yeshiva, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Derech Ayson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, comes from the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sefer (Hebrew)|sefer]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by Rabbi Avraham Yoffen of Novardok.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://matzav.com/yeshiva-of-far-rockaway-dinner-tonight-ben-brafman-to-mc |title=Yeshiva of Far Rockaway Dinner Tonight, Ben Brafman to MC |last=Bernstein |first=Dovid |date= February 7, 2009 |accessdate= August 25, 2011 |publisher=matzav.com}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Zoning suit==
On May 25, 1973, the Yeshiva of Far Rockaway—then located on Virginia Street—was sued by Stanley A. Ginsberg for violating the residential covenant of the neighborhood by establishing its yeshiva building on a non-commercial block in 1971. Dr. Ginsberg himself operated a medical office at his home on the same block. The Supreme Court of Queens County ruled in favor of the plaintiff, noting that the medical use was only incidental.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=197346574Misc2d391_1364.xml&amp;amp;docbase=CSLWAR1-1950-1985 |title=GINSBERG v.
