&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;WGCT-CA&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[independent station|independent]] television station located in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. It is owned by the Central Ohio Association of Christian Broadcasters, who also own [[WOCB-CD]] channel 39 in [[Marion, Ohio|Marion]] and [[WOCB-CD|WXCB-CA]] channel 42 in [[Delaware, Ohio]].

The station went on the air under the call sign W08BV in 1983, and originally did not feature any religious programming.  It changed its calls to WINJ-LP (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;W&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;e&amp;apos;re &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;IN&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;J&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;esus) in 1998 and to its current calls in 2006.  Prior to the purchase by its current owners, the station showed a variety of programs, the bulk of which were old public-domain movies, old cartoons, and current religious programs. Former owner Ella Flowers was featured prominently in many of the musical and religious programs.

The station switched to digital on June 13, 2010 and changed its call letters to WGCT-CD.  It previously broadcast at 83 watts, but has recently increased its power to 120 watts.

Currently, this station is not available on any local [[cable TV]] outlets.  Even with the power increase, it barely covers the city of Columbus itself.
