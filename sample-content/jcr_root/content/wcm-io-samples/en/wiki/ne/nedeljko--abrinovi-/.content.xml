[[File:Nedeljko Cabrinovic.jpg|thumb|Nedeljko Čabrinović]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nedeljko Čabrinović&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[Cyrillic]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Недељко Чабриновић&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (1895 – 23 January 1916) was a member of the nationalist [[Young Bosnia]] movement, and one of a group of seven who intended to [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinate]] [[Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria]] during his June 1914 announced visit to Sarajevo.

This group was called  &amp;apos;[[Black Hand (Serbia)|The Black Hand]]&amp;apos;.

Čabrinović was born in [[Serbia]]. As soon as Ferdinand drove past, he threw his bomb at Ferdinand&amp;apos;s car, but forgot about the ten second delay.  The bomb destroyed a following car, wounding its passengers and several crowd members. Čabrinović then swallowed his cyanide and jumped into a nearby river. The cyanide was old and weak, which only made him vomit, and the river was shallow (about 4&amp;amp;nbsp;inches deep), so he was dragged from the river and apprehended by the authorities. As he was taken away, he supposedly was heard saying &amp;quot;I am a Serb hero.&amp;quot;

This failed attempt on Ferdinand&amp;apos;s life proved to be a key part in the assassination as Ferdinand insisted on visiting the bomb victims at the local hospital. An error by his driver took them past [[Gavrilo Princip]], who wasted no time in shooting Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, who both bled to death and were confirmed dead by 11:30am.

Čabrinović confessed to his crimes, but believed himself a [[Serbs|Serbian]] hero and true anarchist. As he was still a minor, he was not executed, but was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He died in 1916 of [[tuberculosis]].
