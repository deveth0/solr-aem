&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nether Winchendon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lower Winchendon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[village]] and also a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] within [[Aylesbury Vale]] district in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].  It is near the border of [[Oxfordshire]], about five miles west of [[Aylesbury]] and three miles south of [[Waddesdon]].

The village name &amp;apos;Winchendon&amp;apos; originates from [[Old English language|Anglo Saxon]], meaning &amp;apos;hill at a bend&amp;apos;. The Winchendon villages were recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wincandone&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nether Winchendon House&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a grand [[manor house]] in Nether Winchendon, was a former [[priory]] under Notley Abbey in [[Long Crendon]]. It was purchased and largely remodelled by the [[Duke of Bedford]] in the sixteenth century.  It is now open to the public and is noted for its magnificent interior. Nether Winchendon House also hosts weddings and has beautiful gardens. Nether Winchendon has been a frequent setting for television and film production, including two &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Midsomer Murders]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; episodes (as different houses), Lady Pat&amp;apos;s house in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Forever Green]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the [[BBC]] series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Chef!]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; starring [[Lenny Henry]]. Nether Winchendon Church was also used as the setting for a Christening scene in the second &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bridget Jones&amp;apos;s Diary&amp;apos;&amp;apos; film, but can only be seen on the deleted scenes section of the DVD.
