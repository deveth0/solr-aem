The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Newark Eagles&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were a professional [[Negro league baseball|Negro league]] [[baseball]] team that played in the second [[Negro National League (1933–1948)|Negro National League]] from [[1936 in sports|1936]] to [[1936 in sports|1948]].

== Formation ==

The Newark Eagles were formed in 1936 when the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Newark Dodgers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, established in 1933, were merged with the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Brooklyn Eagles&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, established in 1935.  [[Abe Manley]] and his wife [[Effa Manley]], owners and founders of the Brooklyn Eagles, purchased the Newark Dodgers franchise and combined both teams&amp;apos; assets and player rosters.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;NLBM&amp;quot;&amp;gt; http://www.coe.ksu.edu/nlbemuseum/history/teams/newarkeagles.html &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Team management was left to Effa, making the Eagles the first professional team owned and operated by a woman.  The Eagles shared [[Ruppert Stadium (Newark)|Ruppert Stadium]] with the minor-league [[Newark Bears]].
