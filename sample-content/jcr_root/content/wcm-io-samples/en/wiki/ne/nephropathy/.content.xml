&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nephropathy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; means damage to or [[disease]] of a [[kidney]]. [[Nephrosis]] is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;non-inflammatory&amp;apos;&amp;apos; nephropathy. [[Nephritis]] is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;inflammatory&amp;apos;&amp;apos; kidney disease.

==Causes==
Causes of nephropathy include deposition of the [[IgA]] antibodies in the [[glomerulus]], administration of [[analgesic]]s, [[xanthine oxidase deficiency]], and long-term exposure to [[lead]] or its salts. Chronic conditions that can produce nephropathy include [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[diabetes mellitus]] and [[high blood pressure]] (hypertension), which lead to [[diabetic nephropathy]] and [[hypertensive nephropathy]], respectively.

===IgA nephropathy===
{{main|IgA nephropathy}}

IgA nephropathy is the most common [[glomerulonephritis]] throughout the world &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal |last=D&amp;apos;Amico |first=G | year= 1987 | title= The commonest glomerulonephritis in the world: IgA nephropathy.|journal= Q J Med |volume=64 | issue=245 | pages=709â€“727 | PMID=3329736 |url=http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/64/3/709 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Primary IgA nephropathy is characterized by deposition of the [[IgA]] [[antibody]] in the glomerulus. The classic presentation (in 40-50% of the cases) is episodic frank [[hematuria]] which usually starts within a day or two of a non-specific [[upper respiratory tract infection]] (hence &amp;apos;&amp;apos;synpharyngitic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) as opposed to [[post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis]] which occurs some time (weeks) after initial infection. Less commonly gastrointestinal or urinary infection can be the inciting agent. All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production.

===Analgesics===
{{main|Analgesic nephropathy}}

One cause of nephropathy is the long term usage of [[analgesics]]. The pain medicines which can cause kidney problems include [[aspirin]], [[acetaminophen]], and [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s, or [[NSAID]]s.  This form of nephropathy is &amp;quot;chronic analgesic nephritis,&amp;quot; a chronic inflammatory change characterized by loss and atrophy of tubules and interstitial fibrosis and inflammation (BRS Pathology, 2nd edition).

Specifically, long term use of the analgesic [[phenacetin]] has been linked to [[renal papillary necrosis]] (necrotizing papillitis).

===Xanthine oxidase deficiency===
{{main|Xanthine oxidase deficiency}}

Another possible cause of nephropathy is due to decreased function of [[xanthine oxidase]] in the [[purine]] degradation pathway. Xanthine oxidase will degrade [[hypoxanthine]] to [[xanthine]] and then to [[uric acid]]. Xanthine is not very soluble in water; therefore, an increase in xanthine forms crystals (which can lead to [[kidney stone]]s) and result in damage of the kidney. [[Xanthine oxidase]] inhibitors, like [[allopurinol]], can cause nephropathy.

===Polycystic Disease of the Kidneys===
{{main|Polycystic kidney disease}}

Additional possible cause of nephropathy is due to the formation of cysts or pockets containing fluid within the kidneys. These cysts get enlarged with the progression of aging causing renal failure. Cysts may also form in other organs including the liver, brain and ovaries. Polycystic Kidney Disease is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the PKD1, PKD2, and PKHD1 genes. This disease affects about half a million people in the US. Polycystic kidneys are susceptible to infections and cancer.

== Development ==

Kidney Disease is a chronic [[non-communicable disease]], having serious consequence if it can not be controlled effectively. Generally, the process of Kidney Disease development is from light to serious. Most Kidney Diseases follow developing process of Renal Insufficiency, Renal Failure and Uremia.
