&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nebraska Furniture Mart&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the largest home furnishing store in North America selling furniture, flooring, appliances and electronics. NFM was founded in 1937 by [[Belarus]]-born Rose Blumkin, universally known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mrs. B.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in [[Omaha_Nebraska|Omaha, Nebraska]], on a $500 investment. Under the motto &amp;quot;sell cheap and tell the truth,&amp;quot; she worked in the business until age 103. In 1983, Mrs. B. sold a majority interest to [[Berkshire Hathaway]] in a handshake deal with [[Warren Buffett]].

Presently, Nebraska Furniture Mart has three stores.  The Omaha, Nebraska store is over {{convert|420000|sqft|m2}} of retail space and is on {{convert|77|acre|m2}} of land. The store is located in a single collective campus on South 72nd street in West Omaha, Nebraska. In 1994, the store added a massive electronics and appliance store selling computers, software, music, movies and personal electronic items as well as TVs and appliances. The campus also includes Mrs. B&amp;apos;s Clearance Center and Factory Outlet. Both the Omaha and Kansas City locations house over 85,000 furniture items, 185,000 appliance and electronics items and over 1 million square yards of carpet.

The Kansas City store opened in 2003 in the Village West development in [[Kansas City, Kansas]] across from the [[Kansas Speedway]] and [[Livestrong Sporting Park]], 12 miles west of downtown Kansas City, Missouri. It encompasses a total of 1.1 million sq. ft. of retail and warehouse space and is on {{convert|88|acre|m2}} of land. It draws visitors all over the United States and has become a popular tourist attraction.

The third satellite store is located in Clive, Iowa, a suburb of Des Moines. Within its {{convert|24000|sqft|m2}} it sells a wide selection of appliances, flooring and televisions.  Nebraska Furniture Mart also owns Homemakers, a furniture store in Urbandale, Iowa, another suburb of Des Moines.

On November 9, 2011 Nebraska Furniture Mart announced a plan to expand its retail operation to North Texas. The anticipated, initial opening date is Spring 2015.
