&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Never on Sunday&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-el|Ποτέ Την Κυριακή}}, {{translit|Pote Tin Kyriaki}}) is a 1960 Greek black-and-white film which tells the story of Ilya, a self-employed, free-spirited [[prostitute]] who lives in the port of [[Piraeus]] in [[Greece]], and Homer, an American tourist from [[Middletown, Connecticut]]  &amp;amp;mdash; a classical scholar enamored with all things Greek. Homer feels Ilya&amp;apos;s life style typifies the degradation of Greek classical culture and attempts to steer her onto the path of morality. It constitutes a variation of the [[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]] story.

The film stars [[Melina Mercouri]] and [[Jules Dassin]], and it gently submerges the viewer into Greek culture, including [[dance]], [[music]], and language (through the use of [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitle]]s). The signature song and the [[bouzouki]] theme of the movie became hits of the 1960s and brought the composer, [[Manos Hadjidakis]], an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]].

It won the [[Academy Award for Best Song]] ([[Manos Hadjidakis]] for &amp;quot;[[Never on Sunday (song)|Never on Sunday]]&amp;quot;).  It was nominated for the Academy Awards for, respectively, [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] (Melina Mercouri), [[Academy Award for Costume Design|Best Costume Design, Black-and-White]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Jules Dassin) and [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Best Writing, Story and Screenplay as Written Directly for the Screen]] (Dassin). Mercouri won the award for [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress]] at the [[1960 Cannes Film Festival]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;festival-cannes.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3308/year/1960.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Never on Sunday |accessdate=2009-02-18|work=festival-cannes.com}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Trivia==
Ilya meets with two [[United Kingdom|British]] sailors from the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMS Manchester&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. (The younger one offers her less money, but he appeals to Ilya.) There was no ship called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMS Manchester&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the [[Royal Navy]] in 1960.

The two [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] sailors arrive while Homer has Ilya out of her room. The name of the Soviet ship is on the sailors&amp;apos; caps in the [[Cyrillic]] alphabet.

When the [[United States Navy|American fleet]] arrives, the destroyer, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[USS Douglas H. Fox (DD-779)]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is shown from stock footage and is recognizable by the large numbers 779 painted on her bow section.
