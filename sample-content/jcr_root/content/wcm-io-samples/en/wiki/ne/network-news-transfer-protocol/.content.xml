        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Network News Transfer Protocol&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;NNTP&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is an  application [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] used for transporting [[Usenet]] news articles (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;netnews&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) between [[news server]]s and for reading and posting articles by end user client applications. [[Brian Kantor]] of the [[University of California, San Diego]] and [[Phil Lapsley]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] authored RFC 977, the specification for the Network News Transfer Protocol, in March 1986.  Other contributors included [[Stan O. Barber]] from the [[Baylor College of Medicine]] and [[Erik Fair]] of [[Apple Computer]].

Usenet was originally designed based on the [[UUCP]] network, with most article transfers taking place over direct [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] telephone links between news servers, which were powerful [[time-sharing system]]s.  Readers and posters logged into these computers reading the articles directly from the local disk.

As [[local area network]]s and [[Internet]] participation proliferated, it became desirable to allow [[News client|newsreader]]s to be run on personal computers connected to local networks. Because distributed file systems were not yet widely available, a new protocol was developed based on the [[client-server]] model. It resembled the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP), but was tailored for exchanging [[newsgroup]] articles.

A newsreader, also known as a news client, is a software application that reads articles on Usenet, either directly from the news server&amp;apos;s disks or via the NNTP.

The [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|well-known TCP port]] 119 is reserved for NNTP. When clients connect to a news server with [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS), TCP port 563 is used. This is sometimes referred to as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;NNTPS&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In October 2006, the IETF released RFC 3977 which updates the NNTP protocol and codifies many of the additions made over the years since RFC 977.

==Network News Reader Protocol==
During an abortive attempt to update the NNTP standard in the early 1990s, a specialized form of NNTP intended specifically for use by clients, NNRP, was proposed.  This protocol was never completed or fully implemented, but the name persisted in [[InterNetNews]]&amp;apos;s (INN) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;nnrpd&amp;apos;&amp;apos; program.  As a result, the subset of standard NNTP commands useful to clients is sometimes still referred to as &amp;quot;NNRP&amp;quot;.
