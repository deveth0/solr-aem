&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;New Writers&amp;apos; Press&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[Ireland|Irish]] small [[Printing press|press]] that specialises in [[poetry]] [[publishing]]. The press was founded in 1967 by the [[poet]]s [[Michael Smith (poet)|Michael Smith]] and [[Trevor Joyce]] and Smith&amp;apos;s wife [[Irene Smith (publisher)|Irene]] in response to what they felt to be the stagnant state of [[Irish poetry]] at the time. The first volume published by the Press was Joyceâ€™s debut collection, &amp;quot;Sole Glum Trek&amp;quot;, which included an editorial by Smith that communicated the purpose of the Press as follows:
:: [T]o bring out a series of small books each of which will give a young poet the chance of finding the audience so necessary to him ...
:: Most of the poets whose work will be included in this series are Irish and under thirty. Believing poets should be beyond the herd
:: instinct, they belong to no school, movement, club or clique. They are all serious poets, that is, human beings for whom writing poetry :: is morally, a profoundly central activity, not a mere hobby or ornamental grace. (Joyce, 1995: 277)

The press was very active for the first 12 years of its existence, publishing some 46 items, including the six issues of the journal &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Lace Curtain]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Since 1979, there have been approximately 12 new titles, some of them in collaboration with [[United Kingdom|British]], Canadian and Polish small press publishers.

The press was committed to help revive interest in the [[Modernist poetry|modernist]] tradition in Irish poetry, and to this end they published [[Thomas MacGreevy]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Collected Poems&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Brian Coffey]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Selected Poems&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and a special 1930s issue of the journal, all in 1971.

In addition to work by Coffey, MacGreevy, Joyce and Smith, New Writers Press authors included [[John Jordan]], [[Anthony Cronin]], [[Michael Hartnett (poet)|Michael Hartnett]], [[Augustus Young]], [[Jack Spicer]], [[Tom MacIntyre]], [[Patrick Galvin]], [[Paul Durcan]], Robert Pawlowski, and [[Antonio Machado]] (in Smith&amp;apos;s translation).
