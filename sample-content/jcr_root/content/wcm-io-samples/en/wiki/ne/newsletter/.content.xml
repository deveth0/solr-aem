A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;newsletter&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a regularly distributed [[publication]] generally about one main topic that is of [[interest]] to its [[subscriber]]s. [[Newspaper]]s and [[pamphlet|leaflets]] are types of newsletters.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/newsletter &amp;quot;newsletter.&amp;quot;] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (retrieved 5 Feb. 2007).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Additionally, newsletters delivered electronically via [[email]] (e-Newsletters) have gained rapid acceptance for the same reasons email in general has gained popularity over printed correspondence. Newsletters are given out at schools, to inform parents about things that happen in that school.

Many newsletters are published by [[club]]s, [[church (building)|churches]], societies, associations, and businesses, especially [[company (law)|companies]], to provide information of interest to their members, customers or employees. Some newsletters are created as money-making ventures and sold directly to subscribers. Sending newsletters to customers and prospects is a common [[marketing]] strategy, which can have benefits and drawbacks. General attributes of newsletters include news and upcoming events of the related organization, as well as contact information.
