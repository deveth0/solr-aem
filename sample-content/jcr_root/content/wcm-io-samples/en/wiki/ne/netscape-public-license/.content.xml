The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Netscape Public License&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (NPL) is a [[free software license]], the license under which [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] originally released [[Mozilla]].

Its most notable feature is that it gives the original developer of Mozilla ([[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]], now a subsidiary of [[AOL]]), the right to distribute modifications made by other contributors under whatever terms it desires, including [[proprietary software|proprietary]] terms, without granting similar rights to these other contributors in respect to contributions made by the original developer.  This allowed the release of the [[Netscape (web browser)|Netscape]] 6 and later versions as proprietary software.

This asymmetry with respect to rights has led to criticism of the license by many members of the [[open source]] and [[free software]] movements: the [[Free Software Foundation]] [http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/ acknowledged it] as a free-software license
but one to be avoided, and the [[Open Source Initiative]] either [http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical rejected it entirely or was not asked to review it].  The FSF adds that it&amp;apos;s not possible to combine software obtained under the license with software obtained under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].

The [[Mozilla Public License]] version 1.1 is similar (and has limited &amp;quot;file-level copyleft&amp;quot;), but lacks the asymmetry in rights. Time Warner, exercising its rights under the Netscape Public License, and at the request of the Mozilla Foundation, [http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/relicensing-faq.html relicensed] all code in Mozilla that was under the Netscape Public License (including code by other contributors) to an MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/[[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]] 2.1 [[tri-license]], thus removing the GPL-incompatibility.
