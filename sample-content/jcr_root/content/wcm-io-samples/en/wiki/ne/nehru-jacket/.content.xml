[[Image:NehruY.gif|thumb|200px|[[Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru]] in a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;achkan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;sherwani&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a garment which served as a model for the Nehru jacket.]]
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nehru jacket&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a hip-length tailored coat for men or women, with a [[mandarin collar]], and with its front modeled on the South Asian [[achkan]] or [[sherwani]], an apparel worn by [[Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru]], the [[Prime Minister]] of [[India]] from 1947 to 1964.  However, unlike the achkan, which falls somewhere below the knees of the wearer, the Nehru jacket is not only shorter, but also, in all respects other than the collar, resembles the [[suit jacket]].  Nehru, notably, never wore the Nehru jacket himself.

The apparel was created in India in the 1940s as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Band Gale Ka Coat&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Hindi language|Hindi]]/[[Urdu language|Urdu]]: &amp;quot;Closed Neck Coat&amp;quot;) and has been popular on the [[Indian subcontinent]] since, especially as the top half of a suit worn on formal occasions.  It began to be marketed as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nehru jacket&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the West in the mid-1960s; it was briefly popular there in the late 1960s and early 1970s, its popularity spurred by growing awareness of foreign cultures, by the [[minimalism]] of the [[Mod (subculture)|Mod lifestyle]], and, in particular, by the [[Monkees]] and the [[Beatles]], who popularized the garment.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3425500603.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/Nehru+jacket |title=Nehru jacket - Everything2.com |publisher=Everything2.com |date=2001-07-27 |accessdate=2010-01-11}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Several villains in the [[James Bond in film|James Bond series of films]], including [[Julius No|Dr. No]], [[Karl Stromberg]] and [[Kamal Khan]] appear wearing a Nehru jacket.
