The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;New Conservative Party (NCP)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the name of two now-defunct political parties in Japan. The first of the two parties was founded on April 3, 2000 by 21 lower house and 6 upper house defectors from the [[Democratic Party of Japan]] (DPJ). It was then dissolved on December 23, 2002. A new party of the same name (保守新党 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hoshu Shinto&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)  was then founded on December 25, 2002 by [[Hiroshi Kumagai]], also a defector from the DPJ.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20021225a3.html Kumagai to form &amp;apos;new party&amp;apos; with NCP and DPJ defectors December 25 2002] Retrieved on August 7 2012 &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The party eventually merged with the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] after the 2003 election.

==First New Conservative Party==
The NCP was led by party president [[Chikage Oogi]], a former [[Takarazuka Revue|Takarazuka]] actress.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20000617b4.html Ogi&amp;apos;s New Conservatives aim to lay Japan&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;moral ground&amp;apos;] Retrieved on August 7, 2012 &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20000614a1.html COALITION HYPED, DECRIED Party chiefs launch campaigns June 14, 2000] Retrieved on August 7, 2012 &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The founding members defected from the [[Liberal Party (Japan, 1998)|Liberal Party]] after then-leader [[Ichiro Ozawa]] decided to leave an alliance with the conservative [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]]. The New Conservative Party became part of a three-party ruling Coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party and [[New Komeito]]. The NCP was dissolved on December 23, 2002.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20021225a3.html Kumagai to form &amp;apos;new party&amp;apos; with NCP and DPJ defectors December 25 2002] Retrieved on August 7, 2012 &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Second New Conservative Party==
Hiroshi Kumagai and three other disgruntled [[Democratic Party of Japan]] members (Takao Sato, [[Zenjiro Kaneko]] and [[Eriko Yamatani]]) defected from the party in December 2002 and formed the second New Conservative Party with former members of the first New Conservative Party. The party was a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[reformist]] party and was very [[right-wing]]. After the [[Japan general election, 2003|November 2003 general election]], the New Conservative Party was left with only four members in the House of Representatives, down from nine prior to the election. Among the losers in the election was the party president, Hiroshi Kumagai.

On November 10, 2003, then-[[Koizumi Junichiro|Prime Minister Koizumi]] proposed that the NCP merge with the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]]. Following the proposal, the Secretary-General of the NCP, [[Toshihiro Nikai]], confirmed the merger. After all, both parties were conservative.

&amp;quot;We humbly received the proposal and, after discussion within the party, we agreed to accept the proposal to achieve the policies we promised to voters,&amp;quot; Secretary-General Nikai stated on November 10, 2003.

The party is now completely merged with the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan.
