        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;New Life Movement&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|c={{linktext|新|生|活|運|動}}|p={{linktext|Xīn| Shēng| Huó| Yùn| Dòng}}}}) was set up by Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his wife [[Soong May-ling]] in February 1934, with the help of the [[Blue Shirts Society]] and the [[CC Clique]] within the [[Chinese Nationalist Party]] (Kuomintang).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;schok&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Schoppa, R. Keith. [2000] (2000). The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History. Columbia University Press. ISBN 0-231-11276-9.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It attempted to counter [[Communism]] ideology with a mix of traditional [[Confucianism]], Western [[Christianity]], [[nationalism]] and [[authoritarianism]] that have some similarities to [[fascism]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;schok&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; It rejected [[individualism]] and Western [[democratic]] values and opposed [[socialism]] and [[communism]]. It also aimed to build up morale in a nation that was besieged with corruption, factionalism, and opium addiction. Some goals included courtesy to neighbors, following rules set by the government, keeping streets clean, conserving energy, and so forth. Chiang Kai-shek used the Confucian and Methodist notion of self-cultivation and correct living for this movement. While some have praised the movement for its role in raising the quality of life somewhat during the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|war with Japan]], others have criticized it for its lofty goals that were out of touch with the suffering of the general populace.

The New Life Movement was considered{{By whom|date=November 2011}} part of the program to carry out the &amp;quot;principle of the people&amp;apos;s livelihood&amp;quot; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;minsheng zhuyi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) in [[Sun Yat-sen]]&amp;apos;s [[Three Principles of the People]].
