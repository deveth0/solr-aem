The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Newfoundland Hockey League&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Newfoundland Senior Hockey League&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a league of senior hockey teams in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. [[James J. Tobin]] was awarded the position of Honorary Secretary by the league for his contributions to hockey and sport in general, and held this position for more than 40 years. Champions are awarded the [[Herder Memorial Trophy]].

The league was disbanded in the 1980s as costs became too expansive and [[American Hockey League]] teams flooded the market.  Currently the region is served by the [[West Coast Senior Hockey League]], [[Avalon East Senior Hockey League]], and [[Central Newfoundland Hockey League]], regional leagues with less travel.

On September 10, 2011, it was announced that a re-incarnation of the [[Newfoundland Senior Hockey League]] would start in the fall of 2011, seeing two teams from the AESHL ([[Conception Bay North Cee Bee Stars]] and Mount Pearl HJ Bartlett Electric Blades) combining with three teams from the WCSHL ([[Clarenville Caribous]], [[Grand Falls-Windsor Cataracts]] and [[Corner Brook Royals]]).
