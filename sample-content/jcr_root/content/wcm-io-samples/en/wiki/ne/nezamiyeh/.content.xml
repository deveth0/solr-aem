The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nezamiyeh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s ({{lang-tr|Nizamiye Medresesi}}, {{lang-fa|نظامیه}}, {{lang-ar|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;النظامیة&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}) are a group of the medieval institutions of higher education established by [[Nizam al-Mulk|Khwaja Nizam al-Mulk]] in the eleventh century in  [[Greater Iran|Iran]]. The name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;nizamiyyah&amp;apos;&amp;apos; derives from his name. Founded at the beginning of the [[Seljukids|Seljuk empire]], these Ash‘ari-Shafi‘i theological schools are considered to be the model of [[madrasah]]s, or [[Islam]]ic religious schools.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ed(s). &amp;quot;al- Niẓāmiyya , al- Madrasa.&amp;quot; Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E. Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010, retrieved 20(03/2010)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Nizamiyyah institutes were the first well organized [[Ancient higher-learning institutions|institutions of higher learning]] in the [[Muslim world]]. The quality of education was the highest in the Islamic world, and they were even renowned in Europe. They were supported financially, politically, and spiritually by the royal establishment and the elite class. Some scholars have suggested that the establishment of the Nizamiyya madrasas was in fact an attempt to thwart the growing influence of another group of Muslims, the [[Ismailis]], in the region. Indeed, Nizam al-Mulk devoted a significant section in his famous &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Books of Politics (Siyāsatnāma)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to refuting the Ismaili doctrines.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Virani, Shafique N. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 73.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The most famous and celebrated of all the nizamiyyah schools was [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad]] (established 1065), where Khwaja Nizam al-Mulk appointed the distinguished philosopher and theologian, [[al-Ghazali]], as a professor.  Persian poet [[Saadi (poet)|Sa&amp;apos;di]] was a student of the Baghdad Nizamiyyah.  Other nizamiyyah schools were located in [[Nishapur]], [[Amol]], [[Balkh]], [[Herat]] and [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]].

Nizam ul-Mulk was finally assassinated en route from [[Isfahan]] to [[Baghdad]] in 1092 CE. According to several books, he was assassinated by a member of [[Hashshashin]], a group of the [[Ismaili]] sect of [[Shi&amp;apos;a Islam]].

According to [[Mughatil ibn Bakri]], a staff member of the [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad]], he alleges that Nizam al-Mulk converted to [[Shia Islam]] after a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]-Shia debate held on the orders of Sultan [[Malik Shah I]], who also converted to Shia&amp;apos;ism. But it is thereafter that they were both assassinated.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Mughatil ibn Bakri]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;In search of Truth in Baghdad&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (در جستجوی حق در بغداد), also appearing under the title &amp;quot;راهي به سوي حقيقت&amp;quot;, ISBN 964-93287-8-5, p.134-136. Link to item in publisher&amp;apos;s catalog: [http://www.iran-books.com/Book/detail.asp?key=5-8-93287-964]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This narration is disputed, however, by most historians and Sunni scholars.
