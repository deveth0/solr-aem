The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;New Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (NP), formerly the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chinese New Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (CNP), is a [[centre-right]] [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[political party]] in the [[Republic of China]] (ROC, commonly known as &amp;quot;[[Taiwan]]&amp;quot;), and part of the [[pan-blue coalition]].

The New Party was formed out of a split from the then-ruling [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) by members of the [[New Kuomintang Alliance]] in August 1993. Members of the Alliance had accused KMT Chairman [[Lee Teng-hui]] of autocratic tendencies and moving the party away from [[Chinese reunification]]. Originally, the party wanted to keep the name of the faction, but was prevented from doing so due to the similarity of names. The name &amp;quot;New Party&amp;quot; was seemingly inspired by the contemporary electoral success of the [[Japan New Party]] (&amp;quot;Nihon Shintō&amp;quot;; see [[Politics of Japan]]).

In the mid-1990s, the New Party attracted support from the KMT old guard as well as young urban professionals. The New Party was aided by former Finance Minister [[Wang Chien-shien]] and former Environmental Protection Administration Director [[Chao Shaokong]], who had charismatic and clean images.

In the [[ROC presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], the party nominated writer and dissident [[Li Ao]] who ran a spirited but token campaign. In the election, most members of the party supported [[James Soong]], and in fact both [[Li Ao]] and the [[chairman]] of the New Party encouraged people to do so. In the 2001 Legislative Yuan election, the party only won 1 seat in [[Kinmen]].

In the 2006 elections, the New Party made significant gains, seating over a dozen members into public office. The New Party also gained four seats in Taipei Major private offices.

In the 2008 and 2012 Legislative Yuan elections, the party didn&amp;apos;t win any seat.
