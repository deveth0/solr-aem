&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;New Norcia Station&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 35-metre [[ESTRACK]] [[radio]] [[Antenna (electronics)|antenna]] for communication with [[spacecraft]] in deep space. It is located {{convert|10|km|mi}} south of the town of [[New Norcia]], [[Western Australia]]. It was built for the [[European Space Agency]]. The station was officially opened on 5 March 2003 by the Premier of Western Australia at the time, Dr [[Geoffrey Gallop|Geoff Gallop]].  The New Norcia antenna has an almost identical sister station, [[Cebreros Station]], near [[Madrid]], Spain.  A third similar station, [[MalargÃ¼e Station]], is under construction in Argentina, and will provide 360 degree coverage for deep space missions when completed.
