&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nether Compton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a village and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[English county]] of [[Dorset]]. It lies within the [[West Dorset]] administrative district, and is situated 3 miles west of [[Sherborne]] and 3 miles east of [[Yeovil]] in [[Somerset]]. {{As of|2001}} it had an estimated population of 300.

==History== &amp;lt;!-- Could do with being expanded on if possible --&amp;gt;
Nether Compton was burnt in 1066 by [[William the Conqueror|William, Duke of Normandy]]. &amp;lt;!-- Needs a source --&amp;gt;

The parish church of [[St. Nicholas]] can be found at the south end of the village on a road leading to the [[A30 road|A30]] between [[Yeovil]] and [[Sherborne]]. The [[chancel]], [[nave]] and south porch date from the 13th century while the west tower, north chapel and nave windows demonstrate that the church was altered significantly in the 15th century. The whole building was then [[Victorian restoration|restored]] in the 1880s, when the chapel was extended and various internal modifications made.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Royal Commission on Historical Monuments England, An Inventory of Historical Monuments in the County of Dorset, Vol. 1, West Dorset, London: HMSO, 1952, pp. 100-101.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The stone screen is [[Perpendicular_Period#Perpendicular_Gothic|Perpendicular]] and the pulpit early 17th century.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;John Newman and [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], The [[Buildings of England]]: Dorset, Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1972, p. 304. ISBN 0-300-09598-8&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The west tower houses five bells: one from the 15th century (Salisbury foundry, inscribed &amp;quot;Sit Semper Sine Ve Qui Michi Dicit Ave&amp;quot;), one dated 1585, two dated 1658 (Thomas Purdue, Closworth) and one from 1886 (Gillett and Co., Croydon).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Christopher Dalton, Bells and Belfries of Dorset, Ullingswick: Upper Court Press, 2000-2005, vol. 2, pp. 491-494.

Many of the buildings in the village date from when it was improved in the last decades of the 19th century{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, Colonel John R. P. Goodden having inherited [[Over Compton|Compton House]] in 1883. Architect [[Evelyn Hellicar]] (1862â€“1929) is responsible for a number of the buildings.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Hellicar obituary, RIBA Journal, 21 September 1929, p. 772&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  These include Sheriff&amp;apos;s Lodge (1889). The Grade II listed former village school, built c. 1843, is now a private home.
