&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;New Revolutionary Alternative&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Russian: Новая Революционная Альтернатива) (NRA) is an [[anarchist]] organization devoted to [[insurrection|insurrectionary struggle]] in [[Russia]]. Authorities consider the organization to be a [[terrorism|terrorist]] group.

Little is known about the NRA. The media has speculated that it may have as many as 100 active members while others believe that it may not exist at all.

==History==
The NRA first surfaced in 1996, carrying out a number of [[direct action|actions]] (including bombings and arsons) in protest of the [[First Chechen War]]. Targets included conscription centers, government, military and police stations.

After the April 2, 1998 bombing of a police bus, the NRA released a statement calling on &amp;quot;the people to answer police terror with [[revolutionary terror]] and fascist provocations with anti-fascist direct action.&amp;quot;

On April 4, 1999, a bomb detonated in [[Moscow]], seriously damaging the [[Federal Security Bureau]]. Several days later, the bombing was claimed by the NRA, who stated that the attack was &amp;quot;a protest against the bourgeois terror of the Russian state police system against the radical opponents of the regime.&amp;quot; Many journalists rejected the NRA&amp;apos;s claim as unlikely. Two women, Olga Nevskaya and Nadezhda Raks, were arrested on February 23, 2000 in conjunction with a criminal investigation into the attack.

On April 14, 2003 three individuals were convicted of participation in various NRA activities. Nadezhda Raks received 9 years in prison, Larisa Romanova received 5.5 years in prison, and Olga Nevskaya received 6 years in prison. Raks, a member of the &amp;quot;Revolutionary Communist Union of Youth (Bolsheviks)&amp;quot; (cf. [[Bolshevik]]), is not supported by Russian anarchists due to alleged [[right-wing]] ties.

In October, 2005 Larisa Romanova was freed from prison.
