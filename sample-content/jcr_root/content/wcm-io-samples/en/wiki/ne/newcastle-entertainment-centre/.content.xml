&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Newcastle Entertainment Centre&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a multi-purpose Australian [[arena]] located within the Newcastle Showgrounds and was opened in 1992 at a cost of [[Australian dollar|A$]]12m.

The centre&amp;apos;s original tenant was the [[Newcastle Falcons (Australia)|Newcastle Falcons]] [[National Basketball League Australia|NBL]] team who moved to the new venue in 1992 from their previous home at the [[Broadmeadow Basketball Stadium]]. After the Falcons folded at the end of the 1999 season its only tenant was the [[Hunter Jaegers]] [[netball]] team who played in the [[Commonwealth Bank Trophy]]. The Jaegers played in the centre from 1997 until 2008. From 2003 the NEC served as the home court for another NBL team, the [[Hunter Pirates]] (formerly the [[Canberra Cannons]] before the team was moved to [[Singapore]] to become the [[Singapore Slingers]] after the [[2005-06 NBL season]]).

The Newcastle Showgrounds themselves also housed the early [[Newcastle Rebels]] back in 1908-1909. This [[rugby league]] franchise played two seasons in the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]].

The Entertainment Centre is renowned for being one of Australia&amp;apos;s most flexible [[multi-purpose stadium]]s, able to accommodate sports events, various performances and expos. The [[Newcastle Show]] uses the Centre for various displays and the showbag area. The stadium has also played host to some of [[Kostya Tszyu]]&amp;apos;s early fights as an Australian-based fighter.

The venue has a listed seating capacity of 4,658, but it can host anywhere between 2,000 to 6,500 for various events.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austadiums.com/stadiums/stadiums.php?id=76|title=Australian Stadiums :: Newcastle Entertainment Centre|publisher=austadiums.com|accessdate=2008-04-07}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The stadium is air-conditioned (installed as a requirement of the NBL when it moved to playing in the summer), equipped with top-grade lights, and also has scoreboards used for basketball and netball games.

The stadium is controlled by the [[Newcastle Showground and Exhibition Centre Trust]].
