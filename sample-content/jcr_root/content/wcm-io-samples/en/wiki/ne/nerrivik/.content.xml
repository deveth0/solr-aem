        text="&lt;p&gt;In [[Inuit mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nerrivik&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the sea-mother and provider of food for the Inuit people.  She was the patron of [[fish]]erman and hunters.  In [[Canada]], she was known as either [[Sedna (deity)|Sedna]] or [[Arnapkapfaaluk]] and in [[Greenland]], she was [[Arnakuagsak]].

== Myth ==
Nerrivik married the storm-god, who afterwards produced a storm at sea while her male relatives were ferrying her back to their homeland secretly when her husband had been absent hunting. Her relatives having cast her overboard in order to calm the storm, her grandfather cut off the hand with which she continued to grasp the boat; therefore she is now, one-handed, at the bottom of the sea.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/inu/eft/eft43.htm Nerrivik]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; (Rasmussen, 1921, p. 113) [This myth is from&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/inu/eft/eft57.htm sources]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; the [[Inughuit|Polar Eskimo]], of Smith Sound (in northern Greenland).]
