&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;NetPositive&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (often called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Net+&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is the default browser that comes with the [[BeOS|Be Operating System]] (BeOS). It has partial support for [[JavaScript]], but no [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] support. NetPositive originally was the only web browser available for BeOS, but that is no longer the case. The last official version of NetPositive before the Be, Inc. bankruptcy was 2.2 /2.2.1 for US customers, but there also exists a 3.0d3 beta version, and a leaked 2.2.2 which changed from the [[RSA (security firm)|RSA Encryption Engine]] to [[OpenSSL]], possibly indicating that Be were cleaning the source of commercial code with an intent to [[open source]], like the [[OpenTracker]] project.

Built binaries of NetPositive, including all encryption libraries, and other tools not provided by the OS itself, such as the [[HTTP]] and [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] engines, weigh in from 1.4 to 1.7 [[Megabyte|MB]] in size, uncompressed, depending on the strength of encryption provided.

NetPositive can be embedded into another application, or into the desktop of the OS itself, using the replicants system provided by the OS. When [[Active Desktop]] was launched on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Microsoft]] promoted it as having been a major achievement. Be later claimed to have cloned the functionality using NetPositive (where [[Internet Explorer]] is used in Windows) in &amp;quot;nine lines of code&amp;quot;.

A number of projects exist to clone NetPositive for BeOS, due to BeOS users&amp;apos; familiarity with its interface. The most advanced of these is [[Themis (browser)|Themis]], which aims to capture the feel of NetPositive in a browser with modern features. There is also [[Net plus plus|Net++]], which aims to use the [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] [[layout engine]] in the shell of the failed [[NetOptimist]] browser. For Haiku there is a successor for NetPositive, based on WebKit, called [[WebPositive]].

It is still included in [[Magnussoft ZETA|ZETA]] as the default browser for opening saved files and links from other applications, due to unfinished implementation of the native OS bindings in [[Mozilla Firefox]] for BeOS. However, Firefox is promoted as being the primary browser on the platform.

==Error messages in Haiku==

The browser was notable among BeOS users due to its [[haiku in English|haiku]] error messages, which led to the name of [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]], an open-source BeOS clone. A late 1990s email joke which claimed that Microsoft was moving to Haiku error messages in Japanese versions of Windows was almost entirely made up of NetPositive error messages. For instance, a user might see the following error message if they try to access a website that is unavailable:

:Cables have been cut
:Southwest of Northeast somewhere
:We are not amused.

If the user tried unsuccessfully to authenticate against a website, they might see:

:Server&amp;apos;s poor response
:Not quick enough for browser.
:Timed out, plum blossom.
