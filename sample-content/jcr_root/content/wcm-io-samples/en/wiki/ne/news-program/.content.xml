A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;news program&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;news programme&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;news show&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;newscast&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a regularly scheduled [[radio program|radio]] or [[television program]] that reports current events. [[News]] is typically reported in a series of individual stories that are presented by one or more [[News anchor|anchors]]. A news program can include live or recorded [[interview]]s by field [[Journalist|reporters]], [[expert]] opinions, [[opinion poll]] results, and occasional [[editorial]] content.

A special category of news programs are entirely [[editorial]] in format. These host [[polemic]] [[debate]]s between pundits of various [[Ideology|ideological]] [[Political philosophy|philosophies]].

In the early twenty first century news programs, especially those of commercial networks, tended to become less oriented on hard news, and often regularly included  &amp;quot;feel-good stories&amp;quot; or humorous reports as the last items on their newscasts, as opposed to news programs transmitted thirty years earlier, such as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[CBS Evening News|CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. From their beginnings until around 1995, evening [[television news]] broadcasts continued featuring serious news stories right up to the end of the program, as opposed to later broadcasts with such anchors as [[Katie Couric]], [[Brian Williams]], and [[Diane Sawyer]].
