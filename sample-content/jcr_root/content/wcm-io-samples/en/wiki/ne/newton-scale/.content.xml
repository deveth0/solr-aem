{{temperature}}
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Newton scale&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[temperature]] scale devised by [[Isaac Newton]] around 1700. Applying his mind to the problem of [[heat]], he elaborated a first qualitative temperature scale, comprising about twenty reference points ranging from &amp;quot;cold air in winter&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;glowing coals in the kitchen fire&amp;quot;. This approach was rather crude and problematic, so Newton quickly became dissatisfied with it. He knew that most substances expand when heated, so he took a container of [[linseed oil]] and measured its change of [[volume]] against his reference points. He found that the volume of linseed oil grew by 7.25% when heated from the temperature of melting [[snow]] to that of boiling water.

After a while, he defined the &amp;quot;zeroth degree of heat&amp;quot; as melting snow and &amp;quot;33 degrees of heat&amp;quot; as boiling water. His scale is thus a precursor of the [[Celsius scale]], being defined by the same temperature references. Indeed it is likely that Celsius knew about the Newton scale when he invented his. Newton called his instrument a &amp;quot;[[thermometer]]&amp;quot;.

Thus the [[units of measurement|unit]] of this scale, the Newton degree, equals {{sfrac|100|33}} (approximately 3.03) [[kelvin]] or degrees [[Celsius]] and has the same zero as the [[Celsius]] scale.
