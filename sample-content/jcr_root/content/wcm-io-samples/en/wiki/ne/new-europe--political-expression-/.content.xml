&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;New Europe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[rhetorics|rhetorical]] term used by [[American conservatism|conservative]] political analysts in the [[United States]] to describe [[Europe]]an [[post-communism|post-Communist era]] countries in [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. The &amp;quot;newness&amp;quot; of these countries refers not to the length of time they have been independent, but to the fact that they have only recently re-acquired the status of capitalist democracies.

&amp;quot;New European&amp;quot; countries were originally distinguished by their governments&amp;apos; support of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 war in Iraq]], as opposed to an &amp;quot;[[Old Europe (politics)|Old Europe]]&amp;quot; noted as unsupportive of that war. Even initially, however, the term was not based solely on this fact. The governments of several other countries, such as the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] also supported the war, but are not commonly conceived as belonging to a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;New Europe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It is also worthy to note that while &amp;apos;&amp;apos;New Europe&amp;apos;&amp;apos; countries did not experience protests on the scale seen in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Old Europe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, neither was the support for operation in Iraq a major issue in their internal politics.
