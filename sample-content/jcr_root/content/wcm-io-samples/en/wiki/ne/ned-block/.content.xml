&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ned Block&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1942) is an [[American philosopher]] working in the field of the [[philosophy of mind]] who has made important contributions to matters of [[consciousness]] and [[cognitive science]]. In 1971, he obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Harvard University]] under [[Hilary Putnam]]. He went to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) as an assistant professor of philosophy (1971-1977), worked as associate professor of philosophy (1977-1983), professor of philosophy (1983-1996) and served as chair of the philosophy section (1989-1995). He has, since 1996, been a professor in the departments of [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] and at the Center for Neural Science at [[New York University]] (NYU).

Block is noted for presenting the [[Blockhead (computer system)|Blockhead argument]] against the [[Turing Test]] as a test of [[Intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] in a paper entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/Psychologism.htm Psychologism and Behaviourism]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1981). He is also known for his criticism of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], arguing that  a [[system]] with the same [[functional state]]s as a human is not necessarily conscious. In his more recent work on [[consciousness]], he has made a distinction between [[phenomenal consciousness]] and [[Phenomenal_consciousness#Phenomenal_and_access_consciousness|access consciousness]], where phenomenal consciousness consists of subjective experience and feelings and access consciousness consists of that information globally available in the cognitive system for the purposes of reasoning, speech and high-level action control. He has argued that access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness might not always coincide in human beings.

Block has been a judge at the [[Loebner Prize]] contest, a contest in the tradition of the Turing Test to determine whether a conversant is a computer or a human.

He is married to the developmental psychologist [[Susan Carey]].
