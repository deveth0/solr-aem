&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;New Rose Hotel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 1998 [[Cyberpunk]] [[film]] by [[film director|director]] [[Abel Ferrara]], based on a [[William Gibson]] [[short story|story]] of [[New Rose Hotel|the same name]], starring [[Christopher Walken]], [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Asia Argento]].

==Plot synopsis==
Fox (Walken) and X (Dafoe) are corporate extraction specialists, half headhunters, half kidnappers, who specialise in helping R&amp;amp;D scientists relocate from corporations who would rather see them dead than working for their competitors. Fox is obsessed with one Hiroshi (played by [[Final Fantasy]] artist [[Yoshitaka Amano]]), a paradigm-shattering super-genius who is currently working for Maas, the corporation (Gibson employs the pre-WWII term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[zaibatsu]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) who crippled him. To that end, Fox and X employ Sandii (Argento), a &amp;quot;[[Shinjuku]]-girl&amp;quot;, or small-time hustler/call girl, to help &amp;quot;persuade&amp;quot; Hiroshi to defect to Hosaka, another &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zaibatsu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to which Fox is somewhat warmer. Fox is responsible for brokering the deal with Hosaka, Sandii for getting Hiroshi to fall in love with her and defect to a Hosaka lab in [[Marrakech]] (Fox and X are based in Tokyo, hence their ability to pick up a Shinjuku girl), and X is responsible for teaching Sandii how to make Hiroshi melt.

Sandii disappears, Fox is killed, and X retreats to the safest place he knows, the New Rose Hotel, a derelict capsule hotel.
