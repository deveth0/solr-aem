        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;net protein utilization&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or NPU, is the ratio of [[amino acid]] converted to [[protein]]s to the ratio of amino acids supplied. This figure is somewhat affected by the salvage of [[essential amino acid]]s within the body, but is profoundly affected by the level of [[essential amino acid|limiting amino acids]] within a foodstuff.

Experimentally, this value can be determined by determining [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]ary protein intake and then measuring [[nitrogen]] [[excretion]]. One formula for NPU is:

:NPU = ((0.16 &amp;amp;times; (24 hour protein intake in grams)) - ((24 hour urinary [[urea]] nitrogen) + 2) - (0.1 &amp;amp;times; ([[ideal body weight]] in kilograms))) / (0.16 &amp;amp;times; (24 hour protein intake in grams))

As a value, NPU can range from 1 to 0, with a value of 1 indicating 100% utilization of dietary nitrogen as protein and a value of 0 an indication that none of the nitrogen supplied was converted to protein.

Certain foodstuffs, such as [[Egg (food)|egg]]s or [[milk]], rate as 1 on an NPU chart.

The [[PDCAAS|Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score]] is a more modern rating for determining protein quality.
