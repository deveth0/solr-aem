The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;SM-4&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (CM-4) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[PDP-11]]/40 [[computer]] clone,  in the second half of 1980s. It was very popular in science and technology.

The standard configuration included 128 or 256 KB core memory, tape puncher, two [[RK-05]] removable 2.5 MB disks and two [[RK-05F]] fixed disks, two [[TU-10]] drives and [[Videoton (company)|Videoton]] [[VDT-340]] terminals ([[VT52]] non-compatible).

The SM-series also included the SM-3, without [[floating point]] processing, similar to DEC&amp;apos;s PDP 11/40 and 11/34 models. In early production, [[ferrite core memory]] was used.

Operating systems commonly used, included:
* [[RT-11]] (Rafos after partial translation)
* [[RSTS/E]]
* [[RSX-11]]
* [[DSM-11]] (DIAMS after partial translations)
* [[DEMOS]] and [[MNOS]]

Similar models included the [[SM-1420]], with semiconductor memory, and the [[SM-1600]], a hybrid of the SM-1420 and the M-6000(?), a system produced in [[Minsk]]. The main producer was a [[Kiev]]-based factory in [[Ukraine]].
