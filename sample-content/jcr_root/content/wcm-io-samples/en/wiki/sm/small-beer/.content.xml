        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Small beer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;small ale&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[beer]]/[[ale]] that contains very little [[ethanol|alcohol]]. Sometimes unfiltered and porridge-like, it was a favoured drink in [[Medieval]] [[Europe]] and colonial [[North America]] as opposed to the often polluted water and the expensive beer used for festivities. Small beer was also produced in households for consumption by children and servants at those occasions.

==Main==
Before public [[sanitation]], [[cholera]] and other water-transmitted [[disease]]s were a significant cause of death. Because alcohol is toxic to most water-borne pathogens, and because the process of brewing any beer from [[malt]] involves boiling the water, which also kills them, drinking small beer instead of water was one way to escape infection.
It was not uncommon for workers (including [[sailor]]s) who engaged in heavy physical labour to drink more than 10 [[Imperial units|Imperial]] [[pint]]s (5.7 litres) of small beer during a workday to maintain their [[Tissue hydration|hydration]] level. This was usually provided free as part of their working conditions, it being recognised that maintaining hydration was essential for optimal performance.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Small beer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;/&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;small ale&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; can also refer to a beer made of the &amp;quot;second runnings&amp;quot; from a very strong beer (e.g., scotch ale) mash. These beers can be as strong as a [[mild ale]], depending on the strength of the original mash.  This was done as an economy measure in household brewing in England up to the 18th century and is still done by some [[Homebrewing|homebrewers]].  One commercial brewery, San Francisco&amp;apos;s [[Anchor Brewing Company]], also produces their &amp;quot;Anchor Small Beer&amp;quot; using the second runnings from their Old Foghorn Barleywine.

Metaphorically, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;small beer&amp;apos;&amp;apos; means a trifle, a thing of little importance. The term is also used [[Wiktionary:Derision|derisively]] for commercially produced beers which are thought to taste too weak.

==Small ale in literature==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Small ale&amp;apos;&amp;apos; turns up in both the writings of [[William Shakespeare]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray|William Thackery]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and in [[Edith Pargeter|Ellis Peters]]&amp;apos; [[Brother Cadfael]] series. [[Thomas Thetcher]]&amp;apos;s tombstone at [[Winchester Cathedral]] features a poem that blames his death on drinking small beer while hot.  [[Graham Greene]] used the phrase &amp;apos;small beer&amp;apos; in the metaphorical sense in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Honorary Consul]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. [[Benjamin Franklin]] attested in his autobiography that it  was sometimes had with breakfast. [[George Washington]] had a recipe for it involving [[bran]] and [[molasses]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nypl.org/locations/tid/36/node/40921 NYPL, To make Small Beer]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the song, [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gondoliers/gn_lib.pdf &amp;quot;There Lived a King&amp;quot;], in the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera, &amp;quot;The Gondoliers,&amp;quot; small beer is used euphemistically to describe something that is common or is of little value.  The song recounts how a good-natured king in days of old wished that everyone were as rich and exalted as he.  But after promoting everyone to the top of the tree he discovered that &amp;quot;when everyone is somebody, then no one&amp;apos;s anybody.&amp;quot;  So, for example, in the second verse:

:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lord Chancellors were cheap as sprats,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
::&amp;apos;&amp;apos;And Bishops in their shovel hats&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Were plentiful as tabby cats-&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
::&amp;apos;&amp;apos;In point of fact too many.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ambassadors cropped up like hay,&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
::&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Prime Ministers and such as they&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grew like asparagus in May,&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
::&amp;apos;&amp;apos;And Dukes were three a penny.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;On every side Field-Marshalls gleamed&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
::&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Small beer were Lords-Lieutenant deemed,&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;With Admirals the ocean teemed&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
::&amp;apos;&amp;apos;All round his wide dominions.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
