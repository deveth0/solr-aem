&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Myślenice&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-pl|m|y|ś|l|e|&amp;apos;|ɲ|i|c|e}} is a town in southern [[Poland]], situated in the [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship]] (since 1999), previously in [[Kraków Voivodeship]] (1975–1998). Population: 20,261(2007). The town is divided into six districts. One of them, Zarabie, is a popular tourist destination. It is located behind the Raba river (hence the name), and it has Chełm mountain, with a view tower, a landscape park and [[ski lift]]s.

Myślenice is located on the so-called Zakopianka Road, which is a popular name of the [[European route E77]] road, connecting [[Kraków]] with [[Zakopane]] (the E77 itself separates itself from the Zakopianka at [[Rabka]]). Myślenice does not have a train station.

First mentions of Myślenice come from 1253 - 1258. At that time, it was a defensive settlement, with a castle and fortifications, designed to protect Kraków from the south. In 1342, Myślenice received its [[Magdeburg rights]] town charter, and it started to develop into a local commercial center. Among visitors who came here, were [[Mikolaj Rej]], King [[Wladyslaw Jagiello]], German emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], and other personalities.  In 1557, Myślenice came under the jurisdiction of Kraków [[castellan]]s, who were much more concerned with their city. The town began to decline, and it was destroyed in the [[Deluge (history)|deluge]]. In 1772 (see [[Partitions of Poland]]), Myślenice was annexed by Austria, and until 1918, it belonged to the province of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. After [[World War I]], the town became part of the [[Second Polish Republic]].
