&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Murphy Orlando Shewchuk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a Canadian writer. He is a past National President of the Canadian Authors Association. He currently resides in Merritt, BC.

He grew up in the [[British Columbia]] gold-mining town of [[Pioneer Mine, British Columbia|Pioneer Mines]] during the late 1950s. He developed a triple interest in outdoor exploration, photography and electronics while still a teenager. After a stint in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] in eastern Canada, he and his family moved back to B.C. for a job in electronics with writing and photography as major side interests.

In 1971, his work took him to [[Kamloops, British Columbia]], where he began writing a weekly &amp;quot;Outdoor Scene&amp;quot; column for the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Kamloops Sentinel]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. From the column, he moved on to features in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[BC Outdoors]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and  other magazines.

Shewchuk has also been managing editor of the 12th and 13th editions of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Canadian Writer&amp;apos;s Guide&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, published by Fitzhenry &amp;amp; Whiteside of [[Toronto, Ontario]].

In addition to a lifelong interest in writing, photography and exploring the mountains of western Canada, Shewchuk has been a workshop speaker at writer&amp;apos;s conferences across Canada. He has received awards from the [[Outdoor Writers of Canada]], the [[Northwest Outdoor Writers Association]] and the [[Canadian Authors Association]].

He is one of the founding members and a current board member of the [[Nicola Valley Museum and Archives]].
