[[File:Muiderkring.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The artists of the Muiden Circle painted by J.M. Kruseman (1852)]]
In the [[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age of the Dutch Republic]], roughly equivalent to the later half of the 17th century, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Muiderkring&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the name given to a group of figures in the [[art]]s and [[science]]s who regularly met at the [[Muiderslot|castle]] of [[Muiden]] near [[Amsterdam]]. The central figure was the poet Pieter Corneliszoon [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft|Hooft]]; [[Constantijn Huygens]], Dirck Sweelinck, [[Joost van den Vondel|Vondel]], [[Bredero]] and the poetess sisters [[Anna Visscher]] and [[Maria Tesselschade Visscher]] were also considered part of the group.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Paul Zumthor &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Daily Life in Rembrandt&amp;apos;s Holland&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1994 p218 &amp;quot;Hooft once wrote Maria a long letter consisting entirely of mythological allusions, just to inform her that she had left her slippers at his house. But the Muiden circle was something more than a mere symbol of literary preciosity,..&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Some of the music connected with the circle was recorded by the [[Utrecht]] ensemble [[Camerata Trajectina]] in 1994.
