&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Muse Software&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Baltimore]]-based [[software publisher|software]] and [[video game publisher|computer game publisher]] and [[video game developer|developer]] for the first generation of [[home computer]]s. They first published for the [[Apple II]] under the name Micro Users Software Exchange, and later expanded to the [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari]], and the [[IBM PC]].

==History==
MUSE was founded in 1978 by [[Ed Zaron]]. [[Silas Warner]] was MUSE Software&amp;apos;s first employee. Initially publishing games, the team also sold non-game software such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Super-Text]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (written by Zaron), a [[word processor]], and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Appilot]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (written by Warner), a course-writing language. Their original market was for the Apple II and II+, with their first programs sold on [[compact audio cassette#Data recording|cassette]], and later on [[floppy disk]]. They expanded their software offerings for other computers, such as the [[Commodore 64]] and the [[Atari 800]]. The company also ran a retail store on the corner of Charles and Mulberry Streets in Baltimore called &amp;quot;Muse Software and Computer Center&amp;quot; which closed to the public in 1982.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;baltimoresun3&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://proxy-ub.researchport.umd.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com.proxy-ub.researchport.umd.edu/docview/909366949 University of Baltimore]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

At its peak, Muse was making more than $2 million per year in sales.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;baltimoresun3&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

According to Zaron, Muse&amp;apos;s sales grew &amp;quot;extremely slow&amp;quot; because of a slump in the home computer software market.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Baltimore Sun&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://proxy-ub.researchport.umd.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com.proxy-ub.researchport.umd.edu/docview/533500591 University of Baltimore]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The company, which had about 40 employees at its peak in 1983, had shrunk down to just six prior to filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 1985.

Warner, who was leaving Muse to join [[Microprose]], said the company had difficulty setting up a sales program because of the long-term illness of a key sales employee.

The company closed down in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]]. Hence &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wolfenstein 3D]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the father of [[first-person shooter]] games) was born, trading upon the well-respected name among older gaming enthusiasts.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://retrowaretv.com/castle-wolfenstein-the-original/ | title=Castle Wolfenstein (The Original) | date=July 12, 2012 | accessdate=August 29, 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
