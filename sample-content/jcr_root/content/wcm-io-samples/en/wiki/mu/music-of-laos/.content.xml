        text="&lt;p&gt;[[Laos]] is dominated by the [[Lao people|Lao]] but includes minorities of [[Hmong people|Hmong]], [[Mien]], Kmhmu, among many others.  The most distinctive Lao [[musical instrument]] is a [[bamboo]] [[mouth organ]] called a [[khene]].  The instrument was supposedly invented by a woman trying to imitate the calls of the garawek [[bird]].  The woman took the new instrument to her king, and he told her it was fair, but that he wanted more.  She modified the instrument and he replied &amp;quot;Tia nee khaen dee&amp;quot; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;this time it was better&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

== Lao music ==
{{main|Lao music}}
[[Lao music|Lao folk music]], known as [[Lam]], is extemporaneous singing accompanied by the khene.  The Lao people also like to listen to some popular American music.

== Mor lam ==
{{main|Mor lam}}
Ensembles typically include two singers (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;mor lam&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the same term referring to the genre of music) - one male and one female -, a khene player (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;mor khaen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), and other instruments including [[fiddle]]s, [[flute]]s and [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s.  Music varies widely across Laos, with the lam saravane style being most popular, while the city of [[Luang Prabang]] is known for a slow form called [[khaplam wai]].  An extremely popular form developed in [[Thailand]] is called [[mor lam sing]], and is faster and electrified.
