[[Mississippi]] is best known as the home of the [[blues]], which developed among the freed [[African American]]s in the latter half of the 19th century.  The [[Delta blues]] is the style most closely associated with the state, and includes performers like [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], [[Mississippi John Hurt]], [[Muddy Waters]], and [[B.B. King]].

The [[fiddle]] and [[banjo]] are common folk instruments in Mississippi, which has also seen some development as a [[gospel music|gospel]], [[country music]] and [[Appalachian folk music]] center.  The [[Leake County Revelers]]&amp;apos; brand of folk music saw some national popularity late in the 1930s, at around the same time as Mississippi native [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] innovated modern country music.  Mississippi was also home to [[Malaco Records]], a well-known indie R&amp;amp;B label.

{{main|Delta blues}}
The Delta blues is often regarded as the most rootsy or traditional style of the blues, or as the ultimate [[origins of the blues]].  The style has also been called the &amp;quot;most influential form of rural blues (with an) eerie, sometimes demonic power that is unmatched by other American acoustic music&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|author=Unterberger, Richie|title=Music USA: The Rough Guide|publisher=The Rough Guides|year=1999|isbn=1-85828-421-X}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Many of these performers recorded in the early 20th century; however, by the 1950s, they were largely forgotten outside of Mississippi.  Many moved to Chicago, and became a part of the more mainstream [[Chicago blues]] scene.

In the 1960s, however, a [[roots revival]] began across the United States, and interest in Mississippi&amp;apos;s blues musicians increased.
