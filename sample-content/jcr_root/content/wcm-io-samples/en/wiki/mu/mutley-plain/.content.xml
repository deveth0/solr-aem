&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mutley Plain&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a street in [[Plymouth]], [[Devon]], England. Although Mutley Plain is the main street of the dense suburb called Mutley, the term is often applied to the whole area. The road is a busy dual-carriageway, the B3250, with eight sets of traffic lights/pelican crossings. It was built as a smart tree-lined avenue in late Victorian times and improved over the next half century as a local shopping place for its neighbourhood and the affluent area to the north.

==History==
Mutley Plain lies on the route of an ancient road linking Bilburgh, a [[Bronze Age]] settlement on the coast at Sutton Pool which later formed the nucleus of the city of Plymouth, to the north. Mutley was originally the name of two parishes to the west of this road in the valley of the Houndiscombe Brook, the land to the east being part of the parish of Lipson.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Gill, Crispin (1993). Plymouth: A New History. Devon Books&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]] in 1066, the parish of Higher Mutley was owned by a man Alwin of Tamerton, and Lower Mutley by another man called [[Goodwin]]{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}, but at the time of the [[Domesday Book]] (1086) both were owned by [[Odo]]{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}, whose feudal overlord was [[Juhel of Totnes]]. In the [[Domesday Book]] the two [[parish]]es were said to be worth five [[shilling]]s each. Lower Mutley had two farms while Higher Mutley consisted of ten sheep, one farm and two [[smallholding]]s.

==Railway==
A tunnel was driven beneath Mutley Plain by the [[South Devon Railway Company]] and was opened to traffic on 2 April 1849.  Formerly this was the site of [[Disused_railway_stations_%28Exeter_to_Plymouth_Line%29#Mutley|Mutley Station]], opened 1 August 1871 and known as the &amp;apos;Station of the [[Gentry]]&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouthdata.info/Railways-Mutley%20Station.htm|title=Mutley Station (SDR)|last=Moseley|first=Brian|date=2005-09-30|work=Plymouth Data|accessdate=2008-08-23}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was closed 2 March 1939. The Plymouth-bound platform can still be just made out to the south of Apsley Road. The cutting to the east of the station has been covered over by a car park.

==Today==
Due to its proximity to the expanding [[University of Plymouth]] and the city centre, large numbers of students now live in the area. There are many bars, takeaways and cafes as well as five small supermarkets and the possibility of another supermarket being added to the area.

Mutley [[Baptist]] church is a notable architectural feature. The area is mostly built up except for a small park on Moor View Terrace however [[Central Park, Plymouth|Central Park]] and [[Ford Park Cemetery]] are nearby.
