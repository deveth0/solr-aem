The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mudi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a rare [[herding dog|herding]] [[dog breed]] from [[Hungary]]. It is closely related to the [[Puli]] and [[Pumi (dog)|Pumi]], from which it was separated in the 1930s. Today, the Mudi is bred for work, companionship, and [[conformation show|show]].  They continue to be used in herding, as well as participating in a variety of [[dog sports]].

== Description ==

=== Appearance ===
[[Image:Mudi fawn.JPG|thumb|left|A fawn Mudi]]
Mudi usually weigh {{convert|18|to|29|lb|kg}} and stand {{convert|15|to|19|in|cm}} high at the [[withers]]. The coat is medium wavy or curly, with short hair on the face and legs.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.royalcanin.com/breeds/dog-breeds/fci-group-1/mudi|title=Mudi - Royal Canin|publisher=Royal Canin|accessdate=3 November}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The accepted colors are black (fekete), brown (barna), white (fehér), yellow (fakó), gray (hamvas), graybrown (hamvasbarna), black [[merle (coat colour in dogs)|merle]](cifra), brown merle (barna cifra), gray merle (hamvas cifra), and graybrown merle (hamvasbarna cifra).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Colors|url=http://www.americanmudiassociation.org/page-28.html|work=American Mudi Association|accessdate=28 January 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Mudi have short tails which may be born long and [[docking (dog)|docked]] short or born naturally short.

=== Temperament ===
The Mudi is a versatile farm dog that can hunt, exterminate [[rodent]]s, and act as a capable [[herding dog]] and flock guardian. Although the breed is much less popular than the better-known [[Puli]] and [[Komondor]] in its native country, owners of the Mudi claim that it is incomparable for its versatile talents and pleasant disposition.

=== Exercise and activities ===
The Mudi is a very active breed. They need to be taken on a daily, long, brisk walk or jog. In addition, they will benefit from a large safe area where they can run free. They need a lot of running and other exercises to be in good condition. They love to play and will excel in all kinds of dog sports such as Frisbee. The Mudi can compete in [[dog agility]] trials, [[obedience training|obedience]], [[Rally obedience]], [[Schutzhund]], [[Dog showmanship|showmanship]], [[flyball]], [[tracking (dog)|tracking]], and [[herding]] events. [[Herding]] instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Mudi that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Hartnagle-Taylor and Ty Taylor&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |last=Hartnagle-Taylor and Taylor|first=Jeanne Joy, and Ty|title=Stockdog Savvy|year=2010|publisher=Alpine Publications|isbn= # 978-157779-106-5|pages=|chapter=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

=== Health problems ===
This is a fairly healthy breed, although some cases of hip dysplasia have occurred, but not many.

=== Living conditions ===
The Mudi can live in an apartment if it is sufficiently exercised; however, they need space to run and play and would do better if not kept in one. They are moderately active indoors and will do best with at least a large yard. This breed can live outdoors.

=== Life expectancy ===
About 13–14 years.

=== Grooming ===
The Mudi is easy to groom. An occasional combing and brushing to remove dead hair is all it needs. This breed is an average shedder.
