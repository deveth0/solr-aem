&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tigranes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (sometimes &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tigran&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dikran&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; {{Lang-hy|[[wikt:Տիգրան|Տիգրան]]}}; {{lang-grc|[[wikt:Τιγράνης|Τιγράνης]]}}) was the name of a number of historical figures, primarily kings of [[Armenia]].

The earliest Tigranes is mentioned in the [[Cyropaedia]] and in [[Armenians|Armenian]] historical sources. He was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] king from the [[Orontid Dynasty]] and an ally of [[Cyrus the Great]]. One of his sons was also named Tigranes. This son is usually assumed to have succeeded his father, but nothing is known about him.

By far the best known Tigranes is [[Tigranes the Great]], king of Armenia from 95 to 55 BC, who founded a short-lived Armenian empire. His father, who ruled from 115 to 95 BC, was also named Tigranes, as were several later kings of Armenia. There is some lack of consistency in assigning dynastic numbers to these kings. The earliest Tigranes and his son are usually not included, making Tigranes I the father of Tigranes the Great.  However, Tigranes the Great is also sometimes known as Tigranes I, in his capacity as a successor to the [[Seleucid dynasty]].

Another Tigranes was a member of the [[Achaemenid]] family who, according to [[Herodotus]], commanded the [[Medes]] in the army of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] during the invasion of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tigranes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the Hellenized form of the name, found in classical sources.  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tigran&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dikran&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are closer to local Armenian usage.
