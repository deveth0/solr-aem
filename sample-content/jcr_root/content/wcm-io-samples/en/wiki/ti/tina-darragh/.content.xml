&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tina Darragh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1950) is an American [[poet]] who was one of the original members of the [[Language poets|Language]] group of poets.

Darragh was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] and grew up in the south suburb of [[McDonald, Pennsylvania]]. She began writing in 1968 and studied poetry in [[Washington, DC]] at [[Trinity University (Washington, DC)|Trinity University]] from 1970 to 1972. Between 1974 and 1976, she worked with Some of Us Press and at the Mass Transit community bookstore and writing workshop.

Mass Transit, and after it Folio bookshop, became focal points for much of the poetic activity that was to result in the East Coast wing of the &amp;quot;Language&amp;quot; group, and here Darragh met other poets, including [[Susan Howe]], [[Diane Ward]], Doug Lang, [[Joan Retallack]], and [[P. Inman]], all of whom were also to become key members of the group.

She and Inman are married and live in Greenbelt, MD.

Darragh&amp;apos;s extensive list of publications include &amp;apos;&amp;apos;on the corner to off the corner&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1981), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Striking Resemblance&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Burning Deck Press|Burning Deck]], 1988),&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Vickery2000&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Vickery|first=Ann|title=Leaving Lines of Gender: A Feminist Genealogy of Language Writing|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CytMcxoFPrAC&amp;amp;pg=PA191|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=2000|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=9780819564320|pages=191–}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;a(gain)2 st the odds&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1989), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;adv. fans - the 1968 series&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1993). Her work has been included in numerous anthologies, including the important &amp;quot;Language&amp;quot;-oriented anthology, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;In the American Tree&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (edited by [[Ron Silliman]]). In 1998, her work was published in the anthology &amp;apos;&amp;apos;etruscan reader VIII&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (with [[Douglas Oliver]] &amp;amp; [[Randolph Healy]]) and included selections from &amp;quot;The Dream Rim Instructions + SEE References&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fractals &amp;lt;&amp;lt;—&amp;gt;&amp;gt; l-in-error&amp;quot;. Darragh has also been involved in numerous collaborative efforts with others including the recent &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Belladonna Elders Series No. 8: Jane Sprague / Tina Darragh / Diane Ward&amp;apos;&amp;apos; published by Belladonna Books in 2009.&amp;lt;ref group=&amp;quot;notes&amp;quot;&amp;gt;This work is a collaboration in two parts: &amp;quot;In Conversation&amp;quot; (the text of a dialogue between Sprague, Darragh, and Ward) followed by hybrid (ie., mixed genre/poetry/prose) texts. The second collaborative section begins with an untitled poem (&amp;quot;how you&amp;apos;ll know me&amp;quot;) followed by &amp;quot;WHAT IS THE MATTER?&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;s[oa]pitting dignity&amp;quot;. This volume concludes with &amp;quot;Notes for &amp;apos;s[oa]pitting dignity&amp;apos;&amp;quot; and a bibliography.
