Berra&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is Professor Emeritus of Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology at The [[Ohio State University]]. He received the Ph.D. in Biology from [[Tulane University]] in 1969. He is a three-time recipient of [[Fulbright Fellowship]]s to [[Australia]] in 1969,1979, and 2009. He taught at the [[University of Papua New Guinea]] before joining the faculty of OSU in 1972. Over the last 40 years he has spent over 9 years doing fieldwork in Australia.

He is the author of over 75 scientific papers and 6 books including Evolution and the Myth of Creationism published by [[Stanford University Press]] in 1990. His book A Natural History of Australia ([[Academic Press]], 1998) features 200 of his color photographs, 220 line drawings and maps, and over 500 references. Freshwater Fish Distribution featuring 169 maps, 324 fish drawings and 1,700 references was published by [[University of Chicago Press]] in 2007. His latest book, Charles Darwin: The Concise Story of an Extraordinary Man, was published by [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] in 2009 and features 60 b/w illustrations and 16 color plates.

In 1992 he was visiting professor at the [[University of ConcepciÃ³n]] in [[Chile]], and in 1996 he was visiting professor at the [[University of Otago]] in [[New Zealand]]. He took early retirement from The Ohio State University in July 1995 to devote full-time to research and writing.

Dr. Berra is the former editor of The Ohio Journal of Science and was a member of the Board of Trustees of the [[Columbus Zoo and Aquarium]] where he also served on the Conservation and Collection Management Committee. He was also the ichthyological book review editor of [[Copeia]], the journal of the [[American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists]]. He resigned these positions at the end of 2000 to pursue fieldwork supported by the [[National Geographic Society]] and the Columbus Zoo in Australia in 2001.

He is a member of the Board of Governors of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists and Research Associate at the [[Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory]] in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin, Australia]] where he spent most of 2001 working on the life history of the [[nurseryfish]]. He returned to Darwin in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2009 and 2011 to continue his nurseryfish research. He was keynote speaker at the bicentennial celebrations of [[Charles Darwin]]&amp;apos;s birthday at [[Charles Darwin University]] in Sept. 2009. He is University Professorial Fellow at Charles Darwin University and a Fellow of the [[Linnean Society of New South Wales|Linnean Society]]. Dr. Berra&amp;apos;s paper in BioScience (May 2010) on [[inbreeding]] in the Darwin/Wedgwood families attracted international media attention including a story in the NY Times and NPR interview.
