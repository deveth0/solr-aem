&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tiramisu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-it|tiɾamiˈsu|}}, [[Italian language|Italian]] spelling: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tiramisù&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; lit. &amp;quot;pick me up&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;lift me up&amp;quot;) is an [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] dessert. It is made of [[Ladyfinger (biscuit)|ladyfingers]] (Italian: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Savoiardi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of [[egg yolk]]s and [[mascarpone cheese]], and flavored with [[Cocoa solids|cocoa]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;tiramisu recipe&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite episode |episodelink=http://www.rai.tv/dl/RaiTV/programmi/media/ContentItem-509100b3-1428-4109-9e43-73c6ef9c4568.html#p= |series=TG2 Eat Parade |network=RAI |date=31 August 2012 |number=700 |language=Italian}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of [[puddings]], [[cakes]] and other [[desserts]].

==History==
There is some debate regarding the origin of Tiramisu. Accounts by Carminantonio Iannaccone and Nathan Lopez (as researched and written about by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Washington Post&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) establish the creation of Tiramisu by him on 24 December 1969 in Via Sottotreviso while he was head chef at [[Treviso]], near [[Venice]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web

Alternatively, it may have originated as a variation of another layered dessert, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Zuppa Inglese]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;history of tiramisu&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=History of tiramisù |url=http://www.annamariavolpi.com/page38.html |accessdate=16 August 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is mentioned in Giovanni Capnist&amp;apos;s 1983 cookbook &amp;apos;&amp;apos;I Dolci Del Veneto&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book

&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; while &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Merriam-Webster&amp;apos;s Online Dictionary&amp;apos;&amp;apos; gives 1982 as the first mention of the dessert.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web

&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
Other sources report the creation of the cake to have originated in the city of [[Siena]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Francesco Soletti, Ettore Toscani &amp;apos;&amp;apos;L&amp;apos;Italia del caffè&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 2004, p. 110.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Some confectioners were said to have created it in honour of [[Cosimo III]] on the occasion of his visit to the country.

The translation of the name Italian tiramisù (tirami sù) means &amp;quot;pick-me-up&amp;quot; (metaphorically, &amp;quot;make me happy&amp;quot;). This may refer to the [[caffeine]] in the espresso and effect of cocoa used in the recipe.

==Preparation==
[[File:Tvarohové tiramisu 5.jpg|thumb|right|Arranging a layer of Savoiardi biscuits]]
Tiramisu is a layered dessert, consisting of alternating layers of coffee-soaked &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Savoiardi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; biscuits and sweet mixture of mascarpone cheese, eggs and sugar.

To prepare the biscuit layer, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Savoiardi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are soaked in [[espresso]] or strong coffee.

For the mascarpone cheese layer, a mixture of egg yolks and sugar is first prepared, to which the mascarpone cheese is then added. This mixture is spread over the coffee-soaked biscuits. More layers are added and the dessert is finally topped with a dusting of cocoa powder.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;tiramisu recipe&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Countless variations for Tiramisu exist. Some cooks use other cakes or sweet, yeasted breads, such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[panettone]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in place of ladyfingers.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Larousse Gastronomique&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, New York: Clarkson Potter Publishers, 2001, pp. 1214.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Other cheese mixtures are used as well, some containing raw eggs, and others containing no eggs at all. [[Marsala wine]] can be added to the recipe, but other liquors are frequently substituted for it in both the coffee and the cheese mixture, including dark rum, [[Madeira wine|Madeira]], [[port (wine)|port]], [[brandy]] or [[Irish Cream]] such as [[Bailey&amp;apos;s]].
