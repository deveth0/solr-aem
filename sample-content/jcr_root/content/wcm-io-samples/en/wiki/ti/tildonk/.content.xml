&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tildonk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a village located in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] province of [[Flemish Brabant]] and, since 1977, is part of the [[municipality]] of [[Haacht]], together with [[Wespelaar]], [[Wakkerzeel]] and [[Kelfs]].  It has a total area of 7.31 kmÂ².

==History==
Traces of civilization have been found from the period of around 3000 BCE between the hamlet Hambos and adjacent Kelfs. Later there was a [[Gaul|Gallic]] settlement at about the same location.  The oldest mention of Tildonk occurred in 1107 in the family name of Reinerus de &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thieldunck&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tildonk&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the joining of 2 medieval words: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;til&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (forest) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;donk&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (elevation). During the 12th century the knights van Tildonk, pledged to the [[Duke of Brabant]], lived in two [[Motte-and-bailey|mottes]]: Oudenborg and  Nieuwenborg (where the current Kasteeltje is located). Tildonk was elevated to the title of [[count]]y in 1699 as part of the fiefdom of Charles L&amp;apos;Archier. Later it came into the hands of the family de Lalaing. Count Maximilian de Lalaing was the most prominent de Lalaing lord of Tildonk.

Since 1750, Tildonk is traversed by the [[Leuven]]-[[Rupel]] canal and, since 1837, by the [[Mechelen]]-Leuven railroad line.

In 1821, the priest Joannes Cornelius Martinus Lambertz started the [[Ursulines]] convent that later became the &amp;quot;mother convent&amp;quot; of numerous new institutions spread over 4 continents. The convent was renowned for its international school.  The stylish [[art nouveau]] hall for parties was used as a setting in various films.

==Protected cultural heritage==
* The village centre (convent, church, cemetery, rectory)
* The [[Canal lock|lock]] and lock house
* The farm of de Lalaing (Kasteeltje)
* The Our Lady of Comfort Chapel (Onze-Lieve-Vrouw van Troostkapel)

==Coat of arms==
In 1967, the municipality of Tildonk took over the escutcheon of the noble family de Lalaing: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;an oval escutcheon of gules with 10 united diamonds of silver, placed 3, 3, 3 and 1, the escutcheon held by two golden griffins looking backwards, topped with a crown of 3 fleurons separated by 3 groups of 3 pearls&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
