The following is a partial &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Autograph|autograph hobby]] timeline&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:

*1920s: The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Big Five&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of sports, [[Red Grange]], [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], [[Bill Tilden]], [[Jack Dempsey]] and [[Babe Ruth]] emerge. Dempsey and Ruth in particular are considered by autograph experts to have been great signers and to have helped popularize getting [[autograph]]s at [[baseball]] parks and [[boxing]] gyms.
*1940s: [[United States]] [[President]] [[Harry Truman]] allegedly becomes the first President to use the [[Autopen]] machine to answer mail autograph requests.
*1950s: A young [[Muhammad Ali|Cassius Clay]] is allegedly denied an autograph by [[Sugar Ray Robinson]] and swears never to deny anyone an autograph if he ever becomes famous.
*1963: President [[John F. Kennedy]] murdered in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]. As a consequence, Presidential visits are much more closely followed by police and secret service men since.
*1980s: The killing of [[John Lennon]] as well as attacks against [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] affect the hobby: entertainers and political figures rebuff their security detail after these incidents. The autograph collecting boom era begins.
*1993: [[Monica Seles]] is stabbed in [[Germany]], raising security levels at worldwide sports events.
*1997: Publication of [[Autograph Collector Magazine]] begins.
*Late 1990s: The [[FBI]] announces the arrest of different members of a fake autograph dealer ring that was based in [[California]] and had operations in many other states.
*2001: The [[September 11 terrorist attacks]] raise [[airport]] security levels, making it difficult for the public to approach celebrities for autographs at U.S. airports.
*2003: [[Television]] show &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Celebrities Uncensored]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; debuts, showing entertainers as they act in public, unaware that they are being filmed, and giving autograph collectors an insight of who likes to sign autographs in person and who doesn&amp;apos;t. An internet website announces it is selling the copy of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Double Fantasy&amp;apos;&amp;apos; album that [[John Lennon]] autographed for his killer, [[Mark David Chapman]], for $530,000 [[US dollar|dollars]]. The former [[Miss Venezuela]], [[Verushka Ramirez]], is [[List of kidnappings|kidnapped]] and released only after autographing 15 calendars for her captors.
*2004: Mexican singer [[Yahir]] enters the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] by signing 2,850 autographs in one show, signing without stopping for eight hours and fifteen minutes. [[Pamela Anderson]] goes on a nationwide tour across the United States, to promote and sign her book, [[Star (book)|Star]]. A letter signed by [[John Wilkes Booth]], alleged killer of [[Abraham Lincoln]], sells for $1,000 at a [[Boston, Massachusetts]] auction. In April, former [[chess]] grandmaster [[Garry Kasparov]] is attacked by a man after signing the man&amp;apos;s chessboard; the attacker claimed that he was provoked by political reasons.
*2006: The [[Unotchit]], invented by [[Margaret Atwood]], is scheduled for release. On August 27, [[Trigo Figueroa]], son of Mexican singer [[Joan Sebastian]], is murdered, allegedly by fans seeking his father&amp;apos;s autograph after a concert.
