&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tiridates II of Parthia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was set up by the [[Parthia]]ns against [[Phraates IV of Parthia|Phraates IV]] in about 32 BC, but expelled when Phraates returned with the help of the [[Scythians]]. Tiridates fled to [[Syria]], where [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]] allowed him to stay, but refused to support him.

During the next years Tiridates invaded Parthia again; some coins dated from March and May, 26 BC, with the name of a king &amp;quot;Arsaces Philoromaios,&amp;quot; belong to him; on the reverse they show the king seated on the throne, with [[Tyche]] stretching out a [[palm branch]] towards him. He was soon expelled again, and brought a son of Phraates into [[Spain]] to Augustus. Augustus gave the boy back to his father, but declined to surrender &amp;quot;the fugitive slave Tiridates.&amp;quot;
