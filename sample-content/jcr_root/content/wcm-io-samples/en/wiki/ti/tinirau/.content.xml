        text="&lt;p&gt;[[Image:Grey Nurse Shark silhouette at Fish Rock Cave, NSW.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Tinirau is a guardian of the sharks and fishes.]]
In [[Polynesian mythology]], stories about &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tinirau&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are found throughout the [[island]]s of [[Polynesia]]. He is a guardian of [[fish]]. Many themes recur in the various versions. Often he travels to another land in search of his [[wife]], or his wife travels to another land in search of him; sometimes he treats his wife badly, or she rejects him; while he is guardian of fish, it is his wife who gives the fish their individual characteristics. Sometimes their anxious or jealous relatives try to separate the lovers (Tremewan 2002:120).

In some traditions, he has a dual nature; one destructive as the guardian of [[shark]]s, and one a kind, handsome male youth; in others, his right side is human and his left side is a fish. Alternate names in the various Polynesian languages include &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Kinilau]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sinilau&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tigilau&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Tinilau]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

He is half fish. Motutapu is given to him as his inheritance. He is guardian of all fish. Tumetua, Vatea, and others are his brothers (Tregear 1891:513).
