        text="&lt;p&gt;{{Unreferenced|date=January 2011}}In [[computing]], the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;title bar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;titlebar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) consists of that part of a [[Window (computing)|window]] where the title of the window appears. Most graphical [[operating system]]s and [[window manager]]s position the title bar at the top of the [[application software|application]] window as a horizontal bar.

Default title-bar text often incorporates the name of the application and/or of its developer. The name of the [[hostname|host]] running the application also appears frequently. Various methods ([[menu (computing)|menu]]-selections, [[escape sequences]], setup parameters, [[Command-line interface|command-line]] options â€” depending on the computing environment) may exist to give the [[end-user]] some control of title-bar text. Document-oriented applications like a [[text editor]] may display the [[filename]] or [[path (computing)|path]] of the document being edited. Most [[web browser]]s will [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the contents of the [[HTML element]] &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;title&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; in their title bar, often pre- or postfixed by the application name. [[Google Chrome]] places its [[tabbed browsing|tabs]] in the title bar, so it is not necessary to use the main window for the tabs.

The title bar often contains [[icon (computing)|icon]]s for system commands relating to the window, such as a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;maximize&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;minimize&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;rollup&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;close&amp;apos;&amp;apos; buttons; and may include other content such as an application icon, a [[clock]], etc.

In many [[graphical user interface]]s, including the [[Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] interfaces, the user may move a window by [[Point-and-click|grab]]bing the title bar and [[dragging]].

== Types of titlebar ==
Typically titlebars can be used to provide window motion enabling the window to be moved around the screen by using a [[Drag-and-drop|drag]] action.

=== Titlebar buttons ===
Some [[window manager]]s provide titlebar buttons which provide the facility to minimize, maximize, roll-up or close application windows. Some window managers may display the titlebar buttons in the taskbar or taskpanel, rather than in the titlebars.

The following buttons may appear in the titlebar:

* close
* maximize
* minimize
* resize
* roll-up

Note that a [[context menu]] may be available from some titlebar buttons or by right-clicking.

=== Titlebar icon ===
Some [[window manager]]s display a small icon in the titlebar that may vary according to the application on which it appears. The titlebar icon may behave like a menu button, or may provide a [[context menu]] facility. Mac OS X applications commonly have a [[proxy icon]] next to the window title that functions the same as the document&amp;apos;s icon in the file manager.

=== Document status icon ===
Some window managers display an icon or symbol to indicate that the contents of the window have not been saved or confirmed in some way: [[Mac OS X]] displays a dot in the center of its close button; [[RISC OS]] appends an [[asterisk]] to the title.

=== Tiling window managers ===
Some [[tiling window manager]]s provide title bars which are purely for informative purposes and offer no controls or menus. These [[window manager]]s do not allow windows to be moved around the screen by using a [[Drag-and-drop|drag]] action on the titlebar.

Many X window managers for Linux/Unix allow customization of the buttons shown in the titlebar, some with much greater flexibility than others.
