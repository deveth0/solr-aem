The [[river]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ticino&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-lmo|Tisín}}; {{lang-de|Tessin}}; {{lang-la|Ticinus}}) is a left-bank [[tributary]] of the [[Po River]].  It has given its name to [[Ticino|the Swiss canton]] through which its upper portion flows.

==The course==
The river rises in the Val Bedretto in [[Switzerland]] at the frontier between the cantons of [[Valais]] and Ticino and later flows through [[Lake Maggiore]], before entering [[Italy]]. The Ticino joins the Po a few kilometres downstream (along the Ticino) from [[Pavia]]. It is about {{convert|248|km|mi}} long. The highest point of the [[drainage basin]] is the summit of [[Grenzgipfel]] (a subpeak of [[Monte Rosa]]), at {{convert|4618|m|ft}}. Beneath it flows the [[Anza River]], a right-bank tributary of the Ticino.

The river is [[dam]]med in Switzerland in order to create [[hydroelectricity]], while in Italy it is primarily used for [[irrigation]].

==History==
The legendary Gallic leader Bellovesus was said to have defeated the Etruscans here in circa 600BC. Ticino was the location of the [[Battle of Ticinus]], the first battle of the [[Second Punic War]] fought between the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] forces of [[Hannibal]] and the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] under [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]] in November 218 BC, and the first battle on [[Italia]]n soil.

==Towns and tributaries along the Ticino==

===Val Bedretto===
[[File:Ticino at Gotthard-Tunnel.jpg|thumb|upright|The upper Ticino near [[Airolo]]]]
Val Bedretto, a narrow alpine valley named after the village of [[Bedretto]], culminates in [[Nufenen Pass]], Italian Passo della Novena, at {{convert|2478|m|ft|abbr=on}} located between [[Pizzo Gallina]] and Nufenstock. Through it runs the border between the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]]s of [[Valais]] and [[Ticino]]. A road constructed in 1964 goes over the pass ultimately leading to the [[Rhone]] river valley on the other side. French is mainly spoken in Valais but near the pass German is spoken. The population of Ticino speaks Italian.

The road up the val is fairly straight until it approaches the pass, where it becomes [[Hairpin turn|hairpin]]. On the slope below the first hairpin at about {{convert|2200|m|ft|abbr=on}} is an area of springs from which the Ticino river originates. Subsequently it becomes a mountain brook flowing straight down the val to the village of All&amp;apos;Acqua or All&amp;apos;Acqua Ospizio at {{convert|1614|m|ft|abbr=on}}, named for the [[Hospice (disambiguation)|hospice]] for travellers located there at the previous end of the road in former centuries. Currently it is a base for skiing and hiking. Below it is Ronco at {{convert|1487|m|ft|abbr=on}} and [[Bedretto]] at {{convert|1402|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=Walking in Ticino, Switzerland: A Walking Guide|first=Kev|last=Reynolds|edition=illustrated|publisher=Cicerone Press Limited|year=1992|id=ISBN 1852840986, ISBN 978-1-85284-098-3|chapter=Val Bedretto|pages=32–43|location=Milnthorpe}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The val is subject to avalanches and snow can remain on the ground as late as September.

Below Bedretto the Ri di Cristallina, &amp;quot;Cristallina stream&amp;quot;, comes in from the right at Ossasco, and further down Fontana, still in Bedretto. The entire area is laced with hiking trails and mountain huts.
