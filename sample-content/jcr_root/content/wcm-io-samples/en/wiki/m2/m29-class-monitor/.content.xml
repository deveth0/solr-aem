The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;M29&amp;apos;&amp;apos; class&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; comprised five [[monitor (ship)|monitor]]s of the [[Royal Navy]], all built and launched during 1915.

The ships of this class were ordered in March, 1915, as part of the [[Emergency War Programme]] of ship construction.  The contract for construction was granted to [[Harland and Wolff|Harland &amp;amp; Wolff]], [[Belfast]], who sub-contracted the construction of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;M29&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;M31&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to Workman Clark Limited.

The main armament of the ships, 2 [[BL 6 inch Mk XII naval gun|6-inch Mk XII guns]], came from guns originally intended for the five {{sclass|Queen Elizabeth|battleship}}s which became surplus when their aft casemate mountings turned out to be unworkable and were dispensed with.
