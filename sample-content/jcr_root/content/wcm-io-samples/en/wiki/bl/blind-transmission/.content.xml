A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;blind transmission&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in [[telecommunications]], is a transmission made without obtaining a receipt, or acknowledgment of reception, from the intended receiving station. Blind transmissions may occur or be necessary when security constraints, such as radio silence, are imposed, when technical difficulties with a sender&amp;apos;s [[Communications receiver|receiver]] or receiver&amp;apos;s [[transmitter]] occur, or when lack of time precludes the delay caused by waiting for receipts.

==Examples==
*The usual reason for &amp;quot;transmitting blind&amp;quot; would be that the captain of an aircraft knows or suspects that the aircraft&amp;apos;s receiver has failed. The captain would still proceeding according to the [[flight plan]], and under obligation to let other people know of his whereabouts and decisions.
*The less common reason would be a [[ground control station]] not being able to transmit (due to transmitter failure) or not wanting to transmit any acknowledgment (to avoid giving away further information and putting a military mission at risk).
