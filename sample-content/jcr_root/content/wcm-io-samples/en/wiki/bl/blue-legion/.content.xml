The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Blue Legion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was officially called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Legión Española de Voluntarios&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was created from 1,500 pro-Fascist volunteers who remained behind at the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], after most of the Spanish [[Blue Division]] had been repatriated in March 1944, because [[Francisco Franco]] had started negotiations with the western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. It officially consisted of two battalions. It was later estimated that the legion grew to over 3,000 Spaniards. It was repatriated to Spain by November 1944, but again, many remained to fight on the side of [[Nazi Germany]] until the end (May 9, 1945).

The 101st company &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Spanische-Freiwilligen Kompanie der SS 101&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of 140 men, composed of four rifle platoons and one staff platoon, was attached to [[28th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division Wallonien|28th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wallonien&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] and fought in [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomerania]] and [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg province]]. Later, as part of [[11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nordland]] and under command of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hauptsturmführer der SS&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Miguel Ezquerra]], it fought the during last days of the war against Soviet troops in [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin]].

The troops bore an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ESPAÑA&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and a red/yellow/red horizontally striped shield worn on the upper right arm, and a helmet [[decal]].
