&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Blind Hookey,&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hookey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Eric Partridge, Paul Beale [http://books.google.com/books?id=tvRp1whVFUsC&amp;amp;pg=PA94&amp;amp;dq=blind+hookey+card+game&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;hl=cs#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=blind%20hookey%20card%20game&amp;amp;f=false &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A dictionary of slang and unconventional English: colloquialisms and catch&amp;apos;&amp;apos;] pg. 94  Routledge (2002) ISBN 0-415-29189-5&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; is a [[card game]] played with a full pack of cards, sometimes used for the purpose of [[gambling]].

==Rules==
The players, of whom there may be any number, cut for deal, the lowest having the preference. The [[Playing cards#Anglo-American|pack]] is then [[Shuffling|shuffled]] by the player on the dealer&amp;apos;s right hand, and afterwards, if he so please, by the [[Croupier|dealer]] himself, after which it is cut by the right-hand player. The two halves are then re-united, and the pack is passed to the player on the left of the dealer, who cuts from the top a small quantity of cards (not less than four, nor more than his due proportion of the pack). The pack is then passed to the next player, who cuts a similar portion, and so on round the circle, the cards left belonging to the dealer. No one looks at his cards, but makes his stake on pure speculation; hence the name &amp;quot;blind&amp;quot; hookey.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;L. Dawson, Edmond Hoyle [http://books.google.com/books?id=CRHi5En2ZIAC&amp;amp;pg=PA161&amp;amp;dq=BLIND+HOOKEY+card+game&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;hl=cs#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=BLIND%20HOOKEY%20card%20game&amp;amp;f=false &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hoyle&amp;apos;s Card Games&amp;apos;&amp;apos;] pg. 161 Routledge (1979) ISBN 0-415-00880-8&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The dealer then turns up his cards, and shows the bottom one; the other players do the same. Each player holding a higher card than that of the dealer receives the amount of his [[Betting|stake]]; all below or equal pay the dealer. This is repeated until a hand occurs in which the dealer is a loser all round, when the deal is at an end, and the next player deals. 10 players is need to play this game of hookey

==Variation==
===Alternative method===
The cards are shuffled and [[Cut (cards)|cut]], before the dealer cuts them into three portions. Two of these are for the company, the third for himself. The other players place their stakes on whichever two packets they please, the rejected packet being taken by the dealer.

The stakes having been made, the cards are turned up, and the players receive or pay as the bottom cards of their packets prove to be higher or lower than that of the dealer.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Professor Hoffmann [http://books.google.com/books?id=73eB76Nx5WsC&amp;amp;pg=PA39&amp;amp;dq=BLIND+HOOKEY+card+game&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;hl=cs#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=BLIND%20HOOKEY%20card%20game&amp;amp;f=false &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Cyclopaedia of Card and Table Games&amp;apos;&amp;apos;] pg. 39 London (1891)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; If a &amp;quot;tie&amp;quot; happens to be, the dealer wins.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Henry George Bohn, Edmond Hoyle [http://books.google.com/books?id=rlEEAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA332&amp;amp;dq=blind+hookey+card+game&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;hl=cs#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=blind%20hookey%20card%20game&amp;amp;f=false &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bohn&amp;apos;s New hand-book of games: comprising whist&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, by Deschapelles, Matthews, Hoyle, Carleton; draughts, by Sturges &amp;amp; Walker; Billiards, by White &amp;amp; Bohn] pg. 333 H.F.
