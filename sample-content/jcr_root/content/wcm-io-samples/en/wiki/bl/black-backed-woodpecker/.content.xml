The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Black-backed Woodpecker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Picoides arcticus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) also known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arctic Three-toed Woodpecker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a medium-sized [[woodpecker]] (23&amp;amp;nbsp;cm long) inhabiting the forests of [[North America]].

The [[plumage]] of adults is black on the head, back, wings and rump. They are white from the throat to the belly; the flanks are white with black bars. Their tail is black with white outer feathers. There is an element of [[sexual dimorphism]] in the plumage, with the adult male possessing a yellow cap. Unlike all other woodpeckers except the related [[American Three-toed Woodpecker|American]] and [[Eurasian Three-toed Woodpecker|Eurasian]] Three-toed Woodpeckers, this species has three-toed feet.

Their breeding habitat is [[boreal forest]] across [[Canada]], [[Alaska]] and the [[Northwestern United States|north-western]] United States. In particular the species is a burnt-forest specialist, feeding on the outbreaks of wood-boring beetles that feed on recently burnt trees. The most important wood boring beetles taken are in the [[family (biology)|families]] [[Cerambycidae]] and [[Buprestidae]], along with engraver beetles and [[Mountain pine beetle]]. Most food is obtained by pecking, a smaller proportion is obtained by [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] off branches. Black-backed Woodpecker are generally non-migratory but historically have undertaken intermittent [[irruption]]s.

Nest excavation occurs in April and May; a fresh nest is drilled each year into the sapwood of dead trees. Abandoned nests are used by other species of bird to nest in. The female lays 3 or 4 eggs, and [[avian incubation|incubation]] duties are shared between both parents, although the male alone incubates during the night. Upon hatching the [[altricial]] chicks are brooded until the nestling phase. Both parents feed the chicks, which take about 24 days to [[fledge]].

The call note of the Black-backed Woodpecker is a single, sharp &amp;apos;&amp;apos;pik&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and is lower pitched than the call of the American Three-toed Woodpecker.
