&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Blacksmith Scene&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Blacksmith Scene #1&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Blacksmithing Scene&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is an 1893 American [[Short film|short]] [[black-and-white]] [[silent film]] directed by [[William Kennedy Dickson|William K.L. Dickson]], the [[Scottish people|Scottish]]-[[French people|French]] [[inventor]] credited with the invention of the [[film|motion picture]] [[movie camera|camera]] under the employ of [[Thomas Edison]].

It is historically significant as the first [[Kinetoscope]] film shown in public exhibition on May 9, 1893 and is the earliest known example of actors performing a role in a film. In 1995, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Blacksmith Scene&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being &amp;quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&amp;quot;. It is the second-oldest film included in the Registry, after &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Newark Athlete]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1891).

==Plot==
The scene is all filmed from a [[Kinetoscope|stationary camera]]. On screen is a large [[anvil]] with a [[blacksmith]] behind it and one to either side (portrayed by Edison employees). The smith in the middle uses a heated metal rod he has removed from a fire and places it on the anvil. All three begin a rhythmic hammering. After several blows the metal rod is returned to the fire. One smith pulls out a bottle of [[beer]], and they each take a drink. Following this drink they then resume their work.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/edis/video.htm | title=Movies | work=Edison National Historic Site |accessdate=2007-03-14 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Production==
The film was produced by the [[Edison Studios|Edison Manufacturing Company]], which had begun making films in [[1890 in film|1890]] under the direction of one of the earliest pioneers to film William K.L. Dickson. It was filmed entirely within the [[Edison&amp;apos;s Black Maria|Black Maria]] studio at [[West Orange, New Jersey]], in the USA, which is widely referred to as &amp;quot;America&amp;apos;s First Movie Studio&amp;quot;. It is believed to have been filmed in April 1893 and was shown publicly (in a Kinetoscope viewer) at the [[Brooklyn Museum|Brooklyn Institute]] on May 9, 1893.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;silent&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/B/BlacksmithScene1893.html | title=PFSL : Blacksmith Scene | work=Silent Era |accessdate=2007-03-14 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

According to the [[Internet Movie Database]] the film was made in a 35&amp;amp;nbsp;mm format with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1. The movie was intended to be displayed through means of a [[Kinetoscope]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000005/technical |title=Internet Movie Database Technical Specifications |accessdate=2007-03-14 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
