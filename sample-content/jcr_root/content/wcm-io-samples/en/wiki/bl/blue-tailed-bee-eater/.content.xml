The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Blue-tailed Bee-eater&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Merops philippinus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[near passerine]] [[bird]] in the [[bee-eater]] [[family (biology)|family]] Meropidae. It breeds in southeastern [[Asia]]. It is strongly [[bird migration|migratory]], seen seasonally in much of peninsular [[India]].

This species is sometimes considered to be [[conspecific]] with the [[Blue-cheeked Bee-eater]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;M. persicus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

This species, like other bee-eaters, is a richly coloured, slender bird. It is predominantly green; its face has a narrow blue patch with a black eye stripe, and a yellow and brown throat; the tail is blue and the beak is black. It can reach a length of 23â€“26&amp;amp;nbsp;cm, including the two elongated central tail feathers. Sexes are alike.

This is a bird which breeds in sub-tropical open country, such as farmland, parks or ricefields. It is most often seen near large waterbodies. Like other bee-eaters it predominantly eats  [[insect]]s, especially [[bee]]s, [[wasp]]s and [[hornet]]s, which are caught in the air by sorties from an open perch.This species probably takes bees and [[dragonfly|dragonflies]] in roughly equal numbers. The insect that are caught are beaten on the perch to kill and break the exoskeleton. This habit is seen in many other members of the [[coraciiformes]] order.

These bee-eaters are gregarious, nesting [[Bird colony|colonially]] in sandy banks or open flat areas. They make a relatively long tunnel in which the 5 to 7 spherical white eggs are laid. Both the male and the female take care of the eggs. These birds also feed and roost communally. The call is similar to that of the [[European Bee-eater]].
