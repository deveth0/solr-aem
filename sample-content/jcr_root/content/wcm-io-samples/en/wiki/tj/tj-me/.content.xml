&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tjøme&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-no|çœmə}}) is a [[Municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in [[Vestfold]] [[Counties of Norway|county]], [[Norway]].  The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Tjøme.  The [[parish]] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tjømø&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see [[formannskapsdistrikt]]).

==General information==
===Name===
The [[Old Norse]] form of the name was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tjúma&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The name of the [[island]] is probably very old, and the meaning is unknown.  Prior to 1918, the name was spelled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;Tjømø&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=Norske gaardnavne: Jarlsberg og Larviks amt|edition=6|authorlink=Oluf Rygh|last=Rygh|first=Oluf|publisher=W. C. Fabritius &amp;amp; sønners bogtrikkeri|year=1907|location=Kristiania, Norge|pages=251–252|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3YpBAAAAIAAJ}} {{no icon}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

===Coat-of-arms===
The [[Coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] is from modern times (1989). The arms show three silver-colored [[oarlock]]s on a blue background which represents the three islands Tjøme, Brøtsø and Hvasser.

==Geography==
Tjøme municipality is completely located on islands, the main island being the Tjøme island, where &amp;quot;Tjøme sentrum&amp;quot; is located, along with the shops, schools and restaurants. There are a few other central areas on the islands such as [[Hvasser]], with active [[fisherman|fishermen]] as well as the [[tourism|tourist]] industry for the bypassing travellers, with an icebar, shops, boat [[Filling station|petrol station]], and a number of places to buy food and supplies.

There are approximately 4,600 permanent residents on the island, but in the summer months this number rises to around 40,000 inhabitants, including the [[Norwegian Royal Family]] who have a summer house on the island. The reason for the extreme increase is mainly the sea sports available in the area and the remarkably good weather. Summers on Tjøme are both warm and sunny, and the [[beach]]es are filled with locals and tourists.  Tjøme has been nicknamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sommerøya&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-en|the summer island}}). Tourists mostly from the [[Oslo]] area visit this charming island.

[[Verdens Ende]] ({{lang-en|World&amp;apos;s End, or more figuratively, The End of the Earth}}) lies at the southern tip of Tjøme Island, and has for years been visited by tourists.  Ironically enough, it is not really the [[Flat Earth|end of the world]] in any sense, but when one stands there and looks out across the vast area of [[ocean]] one can forget about the geography and really feel like there is nothing else out there.

Tjøme is also a great place for [[hiking]], even though they are limited by the size of the island.  The spectacular [[Coast|seaside]] scenery can be seen all year round.
