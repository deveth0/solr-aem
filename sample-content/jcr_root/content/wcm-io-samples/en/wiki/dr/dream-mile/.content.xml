        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dream Mile&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a match race between [[Jim Ryun]] and [[Marty Liquori]] on May 16, 1971.  The event took place at the [[Martin Luther King International Freedom Games]] at [[Franklin Field]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

Bob Hersh of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Track &amp;amp; Field News]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; wrote, &amp;quot;The build-up was probably the greatest for any single footrace since the historic &amp;apos;[[Miracle Mile (sports)|Miracle Mile]]&amp;apos; at [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] in 1954.&amp;quot;

Ryun, who was known for his kick, was the favorite.  He had also run much faster than [[Villanova University]]&amp;apos;s Liquori (3:51.1 to 3:57.2). The race went out slow, with both going 440 yards in the middle of the pack - slower than 61-seconds. Ryun took over at halfway (2:03.3).

After the next turn, Liquori moved decisively. He passed the world record holder and led him through a lap in 56.7. In the last lap, Liquori would not surrender the lead. At the finish, Liquori prevailed as both clocked 3:54.6.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1084891/index.htm Sports Illustrated May 24, 1971&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Other &amp;quot;Dream Miles&amp;quot;==
The term &amp;quot;Dream Mile&amp;quot; is also used to describe several other major athletics events, notably the 1974 [[Commonwealth Games]] [[1500 metres]] race (&amp;quot;metric mile&amp;quot;) fought out between [[Filbert Bayi]] and [[John Walker (runner)|John Walker]] in [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]]. This was described by [[Duncan Mackay (journalist)|Duncan Mackay]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Observer]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as &amp;quot;...a race to rival the &amp;apos;Miracle Mile&amp;apos; &amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt;[taking]&amp;lt;/nowiki&amp;gt; middle-distance running into a new era. To many it still remains the greatest 1,500m race ever.&amp;quot; In this race, both of the first two runners broke the previous world record.

The current world record in the actual mile was also set in a race where two athletes surpassed the previously standing world record—one might suggest it was a new record because the two had challenged each other to the finish.  In Rome, 1999 [[Hicham El Guerrouj]] ran a time of 3:43.13  and [[Noah Ngeny]] finished at 3:43.40. This was the first time in over 40 years that two men had bettered the world record in the mile in the same race although this race was not called the &amp;quot;Dream Mile.&amp;quot;  [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvCsj7eJKKA See the race on YouTube]

==Dream Mile (Bislett)==
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dream Mile&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was and is an annual mile race run at the [[Bislett stadion|Bislett Stadium]], [[Oslo]] as part of the [[Bislett Games]], one of the meetings of the [[IAAF Diamond League]] athletics competition.  This annual event was interrupted in 2004 for the rebuilding of the [[Bislett Stadion]], replacing a six-lane track with sharp bends and steep terraces with a conventional eight-lane track and seating. In 1980, the [[World record progression for the mile run#IAAF era|world mile record]] was set in this race by [[Steve Ovett]], and in 1985 [[Steve Cram]] also set a new world mile record.
