&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Drapers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, formerly &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Drapers Record&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a weekly business-to-business magazine covering the [[fashion]] [[retail]] sector. It was founded on 6 August 1887 as a magazine for the women&amp;apos;s clothing retail trade. Formerly owned by publisher [[Thomson Corporation]], it is now owned by [[EMAP]].

== History ==
Former editors include Freddie Offley, who joined &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Drapers Record&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1930 as a trainee clerk, and went on to become director and managing editor before retiring in 1980. From 2000 to 2006, it was run by editorial director Eric Musgrave. In 2007, it is headed by managing director Malcolm Gough.

In 1961, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Drapers Record&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was bought along with the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Illustrated London News]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Men&amp;apos;s Wear&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Tatler (1901)|Tatler]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by the [[Thomson Corporation]] and formed into the new Thomson Publications business. Thomson sold &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Drapers Record&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1985, along with the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Illustrated London News&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Family Circle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Living&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Construction News&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. From 1988 to 1992, it was known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;DR The Fashion Business&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but from 1992 it returned to its original name of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Drapers Record&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 2002, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Drapers Record&amp;apos;&amp;apos; merged with sister title, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Men&amp;apos;s Wear&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which had been launched in 1902, to become simply &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Drapers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ruth Addicott, [http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=21605&amp;amp;sectioncode=1 &amp;quot;Drapers Record relaunch to incorporate Menswear&amp;quot;,] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Press Gazette&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 16 August 2002. Retrieved 7 August 2009.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In November 2006, Emap started making a version of the magazine available digitally every week. The website&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Drapersonline.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://www.drapersonline.com&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was relaunched in 2009.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Paul McNally, [http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=21605&amp;amp;sectioncode=1 &amp;quot;Emap completes web overhaul with Broadcast relaunch&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Press Gazette&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 28 May 2009.
