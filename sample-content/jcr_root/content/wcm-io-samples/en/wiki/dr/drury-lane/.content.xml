&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Drury Lane&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a street on the eastern boundary of the [[Covent Garden]] area of [[London]], running between [[Aldwych]] and [[High Holborn]]. The northern part is in the borough of [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] and the southern part in the [[City of Westminster]].

It took its start from the west end of Wych Street, redeveloped in the later 19th century as [[Aldwych]]. The lane led to the house built by [[William Drury|Sir William Drury]], [[Knight of the Garter]] in [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]&amp;apos;s reign. [[Drury House]], with a [[coachyard]] in front and a garden in back, was a scene of the intrigues that led to the ill-fated rebellion of the Queen&amp;apos;s [[favourite]], the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. In the 17th century it was the London house of the [[William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven (1608-1697)|Earl of Craven]], then a [[public house]] under the sign of his reputed mistress, the [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Queen of Bohemia]], but by the 18th century Drury Lane had become one of the worst slums in London, dominated by prostitution&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Sir [[Richard Steele]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Tatler&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (No. 46) gives a picture of Drury Lane as a district divided into particular &amp;quot;[[ladyship]]s,&amp;quot; analogous to &amp;quot;[[lordship]]s&amp;quot; in other places, &amp;quot;over which matrons of known ability preside.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and [[gin palace]]s.
The area was eventually cleared to make way for the developments of [[Kingsway (London)|Kingsway]] and [[Aldwych]].

The name of the street is often used to refer to the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], which has in different incarnations been located in Drury Lane since the 17th century. Also in Drury Lane is the [[New London Theatre]].

The street Drury Lane is also where [[The Muffin Man]] lives as mentioned in the popular nursery rhyme.  It is not known whether the song refers to Drury Lane in London or another town.

173 Drury Lane was the location of the first [[Sainsbury&amp;apos;s|J Sainsbury]] store, now one of the UK&amp;apos;s largest [[retailer]]s. The store was opened in 1869.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Covent Garden and Holborn Young Trails&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - Camden Council, 2006 (booklet)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
