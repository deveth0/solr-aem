&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dragonnades&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; was a French policy instituted by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1681 to intimidate [[Huguenot]] families into either leaving France or re-converting to [[Catholicism]]. This policy involved [[billeting]] ill-disciplined [[dragoon]]s in [[Protestant]] households.  With the [[revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] in 1685, [[Louis XIV]] withdrew the privileges and toleration that Protestant Huguenots in France had been guaranteed under the edict for nearly 87 years, and ordered the destruction of Huguenot churches and the closure of Huguenot schools.

With the edict revoking religious toleration, [[Louis XIV]] combined legal persecution with the policy of terrorising recalcitrant Huguenots who refused to convert to Catholicism by billeting dragoons in their homes and instructing the soldiers to harass and intimidate the occupants to persuade them to either convert to the state religion or to emigrate. As mounted infantry, the 14 regiments of dragoons in the French Army of the period were sometimes used for what would now be called [[internal security]] duties and were an effective instrument for persecuting the Huguenots.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Rene Chartrand, &amp;quot;Louis XIV&amp;apos;s Army&amp;quot;, ISBN 0-85045-850-1&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The application of selective and coercive [[Billeting|troop quartering]] had been initiated by the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;intendant&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[René de Marillac]] in [[Poitou]], in 1681. With the permission of [[Louvois]], Marillac systematically lodged troops with Protestants, in the expectation that the existing law exempting newly-converted from this practice would spur conversions. Billetted troops got so far out of hand that, after a series of reprimands in letters, Louvois was forced to recall Marillac from Poitou.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;This episode is recounted in L. L. Bernard, &amp;quot;Foucault, Louvois, and the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Church History&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;25&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.1 (March 1956):27-40) p. 32ff, and remarked in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;s.v.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Louis XIV: Louis XIV and Protestants&amp;quot;; [http://www.museeprotestant.org/Pages/Notices.php?noticeid=633&amp;amp;scatid=130&amp;amp;lev=1 Musée virtuel du protestantisme français&amp;quot; les draghonnades].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The persecution of Protestants caused outrage in England and created a wave of literature in protest against the inhuman treatment of Huguenots, thousands of whom fled to England to seek asylum. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;dragonnades&amp;apos;&amp;apos; policy caused Protestants to flee France even before the religious rights granted them by the [[Edict of Nantes]] were removed in 1685. Most Huguenots fled to countries such as [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]], England, and the German territories.

On January 17, 1686, Louis XIV claimed the [[Protestant]] population of 800,000-900,000, had been reduced to 1,000–1,500 in France. However, the campaign turned out to be  detrimental to France&amp;apos;s economy because the Huguenots who chose to flee possessed skills such as [[silkweaving]], clock-making, silversmithing, and [[optometry]], and became a valuable addition to the economy of the countries to which they fled.
