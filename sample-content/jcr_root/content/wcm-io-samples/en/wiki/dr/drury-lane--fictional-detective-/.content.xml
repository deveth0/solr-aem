&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Drury Lane&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Detective fiction|fictional detective]] created by [[Ellery Queen]] in the 1930s under the byline of [[Barnaby Ross]].  He is a retired Shakespearian actor who lives in a lavish castle on the [[Hudson River]].  His backstory involves leaving the theatre because he lost his [[sense of hearing]], and the novels occasionally mention his [[lip-reading]].  He appeared in four mystery novels: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Tragedy of X&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Tragedy of Y&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Tragedy of Z&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Drury Lane&amp;apos;s Last Case&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  These books were later reissued under the Ellery Queen byline.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://neptune.spaceports.com/~queen/QBI_3.html#Tragedy%20of%20X Book Review of the Series]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

His name is taken from the name of a London street (see [[Drury Lane]]) that eventually became the site of the celebrated [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].
