&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dragiša Pešić&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian]]: Драгиша Пешић) (born 8 August 1954 in [[Danilovgrad]], [[Montenegro]], [[Federal People&amp;apos;s Republic of Yugoslavia]]) is a [[politician]] from Montenegro who was the last [[Prime Minister]] of  [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] before it was officially transformed into the [[Serbia and Montenegro|State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]] in February 2003.

He studied economic sciences at [[University of Sarajevo]]&amp;apos;s Faculty of Economics.

In 1998, he became a Minister of Finance in [[Belgrade]], when the [[Slobodan Milošević|Milošević]] trusted friend and SNP leader at that time [[Momir Bulatović]], a competitor of Đukanović, became Yugoslav head of the government. After the fall of Milošević, [[DOS]] needed on the Yugoslav federal level the SNP for majority formation, because Đukanović had boycotted the last Yugoslav elections and openly national independence was explained as the goal.

He is currently the vice-president of the [[Socialist People&amp;apos;s Party of Montenegro]].
