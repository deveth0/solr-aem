        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Drest&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was king of the [[Picts]], in modern [[Scotland]], from about 834 until 837.  He was the son of King [[Caustantín of the Picts|Caustantín]] and succeeded his uncle, [[Óengus II of the Picts|Óengus]], to the throne.

The length of his reign is based on the various Pictish king lists, where he is associated with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Talorgan son of Uuthoil&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Some sources, such as [[John of Fordun]], conflate the two kings as &amp;quot;Durstolorger&amp;quot;, perhaps under the influence of the earlier &amp;quot;[[Talorgan II of the Picts|Dubthalorc]]&amp;quot;.

It was once thought that Pictish kings in this period were also kings of [[Dál Riata]], but this is no longer supported.
