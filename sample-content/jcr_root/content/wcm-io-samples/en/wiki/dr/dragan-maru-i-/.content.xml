&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dragan Marušič&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1953) is a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[mathematician]].

His research focuses on topics in [[algebraic graph theory]], particularly the [[symmetry]] of [[graph theory|graph]]s and the action of [[finite group]]s on combinatorial objects.  In 2002, he helped show that the [[Gray graph]] is the smallest cubic [[semi-symmetric graph]], resolving a long-open problem.

From 1968 to 1972 Marušič attended [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Koper]]. He studied undergraduate mathematics at the [[University of Ljubljana]]. He completed his Ph.D. at the [[University of Reading]] under the supervision of [[Crispin Nash-Williams]].

Marušič is regarded as the founder of the Slovenian school of research in [[algebraic graph theory]] and [[permutation group]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}} Currently, he is the third [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[University of Primorska]].

In 2002 he received the [[Žiga Zois|Zois award]] for his achievements in the field of [[graph theory]] and [[algebra]]; founding editor of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ars Mathematica Contemporanea]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
