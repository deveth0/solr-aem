[[File:East Slavic tribes peoples 8th 9th century.jpg|thumb|200px|European territory inhabited by East Slavic tribes in 8th and 9th centuries.]]
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dregoviches&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  ([[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]: дрыгавічы, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;dryhavičy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, {{IPA-be|drɨɣavʲiˈtʂɨ|}}; {{lang-ru|дреговичи́, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;dregovichi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}; {{lang-ua|дреговичі, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;drehovychi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}) were one of the [[tribe|tribal]] unions of [[Early East Slavs]], and inhabited the territories down the stream of the [[Pripyat River]] and northern parts of the right bank of the [[Dnieper river]] (more exact extents of the tribe&amp;apos;s domain are still unknown). The name of the tribe probably derives from the [[Old Ruthenian]] word  дрегва or дрягва  (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;drehva&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;dryahva&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which means &amp;quot;[[swamp]]&amp;quot;) because the Dregovichs used to live in the [[marshland]]s.

The first known reference to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dregovichs&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Primary Chronicle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, where they are listed among the twelve tribes. However, there is a reference in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[De Administrando Imperio]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to the &amp;apos;Drugovichians&amp;apos;. Since the reference appears in a passage describing the Drugovichians as one of the Slavic peoples who pay tribute to the Kievan Rus, and they are named alongside the [[Severians]] and [[Krivichians]], it seems likely these are the same people. By the 12th century they were assimilated into the main [[Slavic peoples|East Slavic peoples]].

The [[chronicle]]s do not tell historians much about the Dregovichs. We only know that they had their own [[prince]]ly rule in the city of [[Turov]]. In the 10th century, the lands of the Dregoviches became a part of [[Kievan Rus]] and later&amp;amp;mdash;the [[Turov Principality]]. The northwestern part of the land of the Dregoviches became a part of the [[Polotsk Principality]].

The Dregovichs left some archaeological monuments of the 9th and 10th centuries along the Pripyat, such as the remnants of [[agricultural]] [[town|settlement]]s and [[kurgan]]s with [[cremate]]d bodies (unlike the kurgans of the 11th&amp;amp;ndash;12th centuries with intact bones). There are [[sepulcher|sepulchral]] structures that look like small wooden houses with span roofs.
