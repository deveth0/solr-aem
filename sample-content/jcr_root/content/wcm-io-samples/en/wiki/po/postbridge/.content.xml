{{commonscat|Postbridge, Devon}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Postbridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a hamlet in the heart of [[Dartmoor]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Devon]]. It is situated on the B3212, roughly midway between [[Princetown]] and [[Moretonhampstead]].

Postbridge is situated next to the [[East Dart]] river, one of two main tributaries of the [[River Dart]], and consists of a few houses, a shop, a pub, and a [[Dartmoor National Park Authority|national park]] tourist information centre.

Postbridge is best known for its fine example of an ancient [[clapper bridge]] over the river. First recorded in the 14th century, the bridge is believed to have been built in the 13th century to enable pack horses to cross the river, carrying tin to the [[stannary]] town of [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]]. The clapper bridge which is a Grade II* [[listed building|listed structure]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{IoE|92789}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
is still complete, and stands alongside today&amp;apos;s structure, a Grade II listed structure built in the 1780s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{IoE|92788}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
