&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pottsylvania&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[fictional country]] that appeared in the [[television]] series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show|Rocky and His Friends]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show|The Bullwinkle Show]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, collectively referred to as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rocky and Bullwinkle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Pottsylvania is a parody of a [[Cold War]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Snow, Tony: &amp;quot;Clinton&amp;apos;s War Objective: To Make The World Safe for Diplomates&amp;quot;, pg B7. St Louis Post-Dispatch, Feb 19,1998&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&amp;amp;p_theme=cstb&amp;amp;p_action=search&amp;amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB373AA477297BF&amp;amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;amp;p_perpage=10&amp;amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;amp;s_trackval=GooglePM] Chicago Sun Times - It&amp;apos;s on to Pottsylvania, 1992&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;-era eastern [[Europe]]an&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.tvacres.com/ethnic_russian.htm Russia in US TV Shows&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; country (possibly intended as a satire on [[East Germany]]: Pottsylvanian characters often use German words, and the [[Iron Cross]] can be seen on military aircraft). It was noted for being a nation dedicated to all matters related to [[espionage]] and deceitfulness; children were taught in schools how to commit crimes, for instance, while casual conversations would have double meanings.

Populated entirely by [[government agents]] and [[saboteurs]], Pottsylvania is the one nation where the [[cold war]] never thawed. Its highest honor was the Double Cross, and its newspaper, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Pottsylvania Eavesdropper&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was printed in invisible ink. While many considered Pottsylvania to be a spoof, it was considered offensive by the government of the Soviet Union, which banned &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rocky &amp;amp; Bullwinkle&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as anti-Soviet propaganda.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E1D91F31F933A05757C0A9669C8B63] Lidz, Frank:&amp;quot; SUMMER FILMS: CREATURE FEATURES; The Ongoing Adventures of Moose and Squirrel&amp;quot;, New York Times, April 30 2000&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Pottsylvania&amp;apos;s industries, besides [[espionage]], included production of a [[vehicle]] called the &amp;quot;[[assassination|Assassin-8]]&amp;quot;. Millions were built despite Pottsylvania having only 12 miles of road.

Natural landmarks included &amp;quot;Whynchatakea Peak&amp;quot;, a large [[mountain]]. The [[geography]] of Pottsylvania is indeterminate, however. In some locations it appears to be a [[peninsula]], while in others it appears to be either a coastal nation (with [[seaports]]) or completely landlocked. Nevertheless, it is accessible by [[submarine]], which appears to be the main form of entry.

[[Flora (plants)|Flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] in Pottsylvania included the man-eating [[Venus flytrap]]-like [[plant]] known as the &amp;quot;Pottsylvania Creeper,&amp;quot; and one of the world&amp;apos;s few supplies of mooseberry bushes &amp;amp;ndash; mooseberries being an ingredient used (in Rocky and Bullwinkle&amp;apos;s world) for the production of [[rocket]] [[fuel]].

The [[government]] of Pottsylvania had been headed by a uniformed [[dictator]] known only as [[Fearless Leader]]. (In some episodes, another important government figure is [[Mr. Big (Rocky and Bullwinkle)|Mr. Big]].) [[Boris Badenov]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.erie.gov/sheriff/most_wanted/boris.asp Most Wanted: Boris Bandanov&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and [[Natasha Fatale]] seemed to be Fearless Leader&amp;apos;s most frequently used [[secret agent]]s, often sent to execute the country&amp;apos;s schemes for gaining global power.

==[[National anthem]]==
&amp;quot;Hail Pottsylvania&amp;quot; is the [[national anthem]] of Pottsylvania, which appears in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Lyrics:
:Hail, Pottsylvania
:Hail to the black and the blue!
:Hail, Pottsylvania
:Sneaky and crooked through and through,
:Down with the good guys, up with the boss
:Under the sign of the triple cross, hey!
:Hail, Pottsylvania,
:Hail, hail, hail!
