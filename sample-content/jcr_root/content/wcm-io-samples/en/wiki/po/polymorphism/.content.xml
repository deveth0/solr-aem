&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Polymorphism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;dimorphism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; may refer to:

{{tocright}}
==Biology==
* [[Polymorphism (biology)]], including:
** having multiple [[phenotype]]s within a population; the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;switch&amp;apos;&amp;apos; that determines which phenotype an individual displays can be genetic or environmental
*** includes [[Sexual dimorphism]], differences in the physiology of a species based only on sex
**Point mutations in the DNA
*** having multiple alleles of a gene within a population, usually expressing different phenotypes
*** [[genetic marker]]s based on such allelic variations, including [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s
* [[Lipid polymorphism]], the property of amphiphiles that gives rise to various aggregations of lipids
* [[Nuclear dimorphism]], when a cell&amp;apos;s nuclear apparatus is composed of two structurally and functionally differentiated types of nuclei
*[[Frond dimorphism]], differing forms of fern fronds between the sterile and fertile fronds

==Computing==
* [[Polymorphism (computer science)]], allowing program code to work with various types
** [[Polymorphism in object-oriented programming]], the ability of an interface to be realized in multiple ways
* Dialog polymorphism, changing the form of a computer dialog every time it is presented to a user, in order to prevent [[habituation]]
* [[Polymorphic code]], self-modifying program code designed to defeat anti-virus programs or to defeat reverse engineers

==Chemistry==
* [[Polymorphism (materials science)]], the ability of a solid material to exist in more than one form or crystal structure

==Medicine==
* A type of [[QRS complex]] seen on an electrocardiogram

==Psychology==
* [[Polymorphous perversity]], a concept in psychoanalytic theory
