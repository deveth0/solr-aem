{{Politics of Mayotte}}

This change was approved by 73% at a referendum on Mayotte. After the constitutional reform of 2003 it became a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[collectivité d&amp;apos;outre-mer]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; while keeping the title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;collectivité départementale de Mayotte&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
