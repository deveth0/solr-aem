[[Image:The Love Potion.jpg|right|thumb|&amp;quot;The Love Potion&amp;quot; by [[Evelyn de Morgan]].]]
A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;potion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (from [[Latin language|Latin]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;potio&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;drink&amp;quot;, in turn derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;poton&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;that which one drinks&amp;quot;) is a consumable [[medicine]] or [[poison]].

In [[mythology]] and literature, a potion is usually made by a [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]], [[magic (paranormal)|sorcerer]], [[dragon]], [[fairy]] or [[witch]] and has [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] properties. It might be used to heal, bewitch or poison people.  For example, love potions make a person fall in love (or become deeply infatuated) with another (the love potion figures tragically into most versions of the tale of [[Tristan and Iseult]], including [[Richard Wagner]]&amp;apos;s opera &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Tristan und Isolde]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;); sleeping potions cause a person to fall asleep (in folklore, this can range from normal sleep to a deathlike trance); and elixirs heal/cure any wound/malady (as in [[C.S. Lewis]]&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). Goscinny and Uderzo&amp;apos;s character [[Asterix the Gaul]] gained superhuman strength from a magic potion brewed by the druid Getafix.

Creation of potions of different kinds was a common practice of [[alchemy]], and was commonly associated with witchcraft, as in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Macbeth|The Tragedy of Macbeth]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[William Shakespeare]].

During the 19th Century, it was common in certain countries to see wandering charlatans offering curative potions. These eventually gained reputations as [[quack medicine]]s.

In modern [[fantasy]], potions are often portrayed as [[magic item|spells in liquid form]], capable of causing a variety of effects, including healing, amnesia, infatuation, [[shapeshifting|transformation]], [[invisibility]], and invulnerability.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;John Grant and John Clute, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Encyclopedia of Fantasy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;Potions&amp;quot;, p 779 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Potions have also gained popularity as a standard item in [[role-playing video game]]s, usually as a healing item. The availability of healing potions in the popular &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Final Fantasy]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; series of games eventually resulted in the release of an actual beverage named &amp;quot;Potion&amp;quot; in [[Japan]] by [[Square Enix]], the games&amp;apos; creators.
