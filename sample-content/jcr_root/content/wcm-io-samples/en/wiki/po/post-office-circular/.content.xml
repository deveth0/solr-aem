From the introduction of the [[Penny Black]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[postal system]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Post Office Circulars&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; have been sent out from the main office, (originally in Edinburgh), to give information and examples of the new [[postage stamps]] which were coming into general use.

The original notice regarding the introduction of [[postage stamps]] was sent out in April 1840 and refers to the usage and cancellation of the 1d and 2d stamps. These are usually found with a pair of [[penny black]]s attached.

A second notice was sent on 7 May with examples of the 2d stamps as well as the [[VR official]]. The pairs of stamps sent with this notice were not originally attached to the notice.
