&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Portlandia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a sculpture by [[Raymond Kaskey]] located above the entrance of [[Michael Graves]]&amp;apos; [[Portland Building]] in downtown [[Portland, Oregon]], at 1120 SW 5th Avenue. It is the second-largest [[repoussé|copper repoussé]] statue in the United States, after the [[Statue of Liberty]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Warren, Stuart &amp;amp; Ted Ishikawa. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oregon Handbook&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Moon Publications, 1991.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Raymond Kaskey]], [[Greg Pettengill]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.coteart.com&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and Michael LaSalle built sections of the statue in one of the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., and shipped the parts to Portland by ship.  It was assembled at a barge building facility, Gunderson, Inc. It was installed on October 6, 1985,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;warmwelcome&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Crick, Rolla J. (October 7, 1985). &amp;quot;Thousands bid ‘Portlandia’ warm welcome: Statue lifted successfully to final spot&amp;quot;. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Oregonian]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p. A1.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; after being floated up the [[Willamette River]] on a barge.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ota, Alan K. (October 7, 1985). &amp;quot;‘Portlandia’ wends way along river, city streets to delight of onlookers&amp;quot;. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Oregonian&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p. B3.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The statue is based on the design of [[Seal of Portland, Oregon|the city seal]]. It depicts a woman dressed in classical clothes, holding a trident in the left hand and reaching down with the right hand to greet visitors to the building.

The statue itself is 34 feet, 10 inches (10.6 meters) high.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;warmwelcome&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; If standing, the woman would be about 50 feet (15 m) tall. An accompanying plaque contains a poem by Portland resident [[Ronald Talney]].

The statue is above street level, and faces a narrow, tree-lined street with limited automobile access. Occasionally, there are suggestions to move the statue to a more visible location, but these have come to nothing and the sculptor states that he designed the statue for its location and would not approve of moving it.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

It has also been claimed that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Portlandia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s relatively low profile results from sculptor Kaskey&amp;apos;s close guarding of his [[intellectual property]]. Unlike the [[Statue of Liberty]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Portlandia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; may not be reproduced for any commercial purpose without permission from the artist. The rights to the image of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Portlandia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; remain Kaskey&amp;apos;s sole property.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news
