&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pope Evaristus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-it|Evaristo}}; died c. 107) was the [[Pope|head]] of the [[Catholic Church]] from c. 99 to his death c. 107.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope St. Evaristus}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;According to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Annuario Pontificio]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, he died in 108.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aristus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Little is known about St Evaristus. According to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Liber Pontificalis]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, he came from a family of [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenic Jewish origin]] living in [[Bethlehem]]. He was elected during the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Domitian]], the time of the [[Persecution of Christians|second general persecution]] and succeeded [[Pope Clement I|St Clement]] in the [[Holy See|See of Rome]].

[[Eusebius]], in his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; IV, I, stated that Evaristus died in the 12th year of the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Trajan]], after holding the office of bishop of the Romans for eight years. He is said by the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Liber Pontificalis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to have divided Rome into several &amp;quot;[[Titulus (Roman Catholic)|titles]]&amp;quot; or Parishes, assigning a [[priest]] to each, and appointed seven [[deacon]]s for the city.

He is usually accorded the title of martyr; however, there is no confirmation of this in the case of Pope Evaristus, who is listed without that title in the [[Roman Martyrology]], with a feast day on 26 October.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Martyrologium Romanum&amp;quot; (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 ISBN 88-209-7210-7)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is probable that St Evaristus was buried near [[St Peter&amp;apos;s tomb]] in the Vatican.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=633 Catholic Online – Saints &amp;amp; Angels: &amp;quot;St. Evaristus&amp;quot;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  It is also probable that [[John the Apostle|St. John]] the apostle died during the beginning of Evaristus&amp;apos; reign.
