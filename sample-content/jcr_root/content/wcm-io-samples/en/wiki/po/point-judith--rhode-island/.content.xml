==History==
[[File:Light House Visit.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[United States Navy]] and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] personnel at the [[Point Judith Light]]]]
Point Judith was named in the seventeenth century after Judith Thatcher who was a passenger on  a small vessel with her father when it ran aground on the point and was almost wrecked.  Allegedly, Judith rendered great service and as a result the vessel was saved.  In remembrance of this the crew called the point after her name.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;How Point Judith got its name; from notes found in the 1854 genealogy of the Greenleaf family. Note 98, pg. 110.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

During the [[American Revolution]], the British controlled Narragansett Bay and raided and burned the farms on Point Judith and the surrounding areas in the late 1770s under Captain Wallace.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=G0IBAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA13&amp;amp;dq=%22point+judith%22+british+rhode&amp;amp;as_brr=1]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Point Judith is the site of the last sinking of an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] ship in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] during [[World War II]]. On May 5, 1945, at 5:40 p.m., the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[U-853]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; torpedoed the [[Collier (ship type)|collier]], [[SS Black Point|SS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Black Point&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.usmm.org/blackpoint.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; en route to [[Boston]], She was within sight of the [[United States Coast Guard]] lighthouse station at Point Judith. The lookout at the lighthouse was just preparing to enter the sighting in his logbook when he heard the sound of the torpedo exploding as it hit the ship. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Black Point&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sank within twenty-five minutes. Twelve lives were lost among her crew, while thirty-four survivors were rescued. The resulting [[United States Navy]] and Coast Guard hunt for the U-853 is now often referred to as the [[Battle of Point Judith]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.desausa.org/de_photo_library/battle_of_point_judith.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; A United States Navy [[frigate]], [[destroyer]]s, [[destroyer escort]]s, and Coast Guard [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutters]] converged on the waters off Point Judith. Attacks with [[depth charges]] and [[hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]]s continued until the U-853&amp;apos;s destruction was confirmed the next morning by two [[blimp]]s which dropped a few bombs on the Germans. U-853 may have been the last [[U-boat]] to sink a ship during World War II, but she also became the second to last one to be sunk. Her wreck lies in 135 feet of water and is a popular, but dangerous destination for sport divers; at least three divers have been killed there.

==In popular culture==
