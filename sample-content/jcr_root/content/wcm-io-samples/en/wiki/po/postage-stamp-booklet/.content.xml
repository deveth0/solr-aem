Booklets are often made from sheets especially printed for this purpose, with a narrow selvedge at one side of the booklet pane for binding.&amp;lt;ref name=Bennett&amp;gt;Bennett, Russell and Watson, James; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Philatelic Terms Illustrated&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Stanley Gibbons Publications, London (1978).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  From the cutting, the panes are usually imperforate on the edges of the booklet. Smaller and easier to handle than a whole sheet of stamps, in many countries booklets have become a favored way to purchase stamps.

== History ==
Booklets of [[telegraph stamp]]s are known to have been issued by the [[California State Telegraph Company]] in 1870, and by [[Western Union]] in 1871, and on 14 October 1884 an [[A.W. Cooke]] of Boston received Patent 306,674 from the [[United States Patent Office]] for the idea of putting postage stamps into booklets.

Luxembourg was the first country to issue booklets, in 1895, followed by Sweden in 1898 and Great Britain in 1904.&amp;lt;ref name=Bennett /&amp;gt; The idea became popular and quickly spread around the world.

== Production ==
Originally booklets were produced manually, by separating sheets into smaller panes and binding those. These are not distinguishable from the sheet stamps. Later, the popularity of booklets meant that it was worthwhile to produce booklet panes directly; printing onto large sheets, then cutting into &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;booklet panes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; each with a small number of stamps, and perforating between the stamps of each pane.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/booklets_20030616/refreshercourse.aspx |title=Postage stamp booklets add zest to collecting |first=Klug |last=Janet |work=Refresher Course |publisher=[[Linn&amp;apos;s Stamp News]] |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; These kinds of stamps usually have 1, 2, or 3 straight edges, although some booklet panes have been printed 3 stamps across, and the middle stamps will have perforations all around.

Some countries, such as Sweden, routinely issue a single stamp design in [[coil stamp|coils]], booklets, and sheets. The complete stamp collection will contain examples of each of these. Some collectors specialize in collecting the booklets themselves, or whole panes from a booklet; these often sell at a premium over the equivalent number of stamps. The oldest types of booklets were not much noticed at the time, nearly all used for postage, and intact booklets are quite rare today.
