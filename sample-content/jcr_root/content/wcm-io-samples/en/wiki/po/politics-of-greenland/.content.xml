{{Politics of Greenland}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Politics of [[Greenland]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Dependent territory|dependency]].&amp;lt;ref name=PR-type&amp;gt;[http://www.electionguide.org/country.php?ID=86 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Greenland Country Profile&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ]  International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) ElectioGuide&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The [[Prime Minister of Greenland|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]]. Greenland is a self-governing overseas administrative division of Denmark since 1979. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[Parliament of Greenland]] (known as Inatsisartut). The party system is dominated by the social democratic [[Forward (Greenland)|Forward]], the separatist and socialist [[Inuit Community]] and the conservative liberal and unionist [[Feeling of Community]].
The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

==Executive branch==
The monarch of [[Denmark]] is also head of state of Greenland. She is represented by a High Commissioner, appointed by her. The Prime Minister is elected by Parliament and leads the Landsstyre.

Two representatives were elected to the [[Parliament of Denmark]] at the last Danish elections, [[Siumut]] 1, [[Inuit Ataqatigiit]] 1.

== Diplomatic representations ==
With Denmark having responsibility for Greenland&amp;apos;s international affairs, other countries do not have direct diplomatic representation in Greenlandâ€”their embassies or consulates in Denmark are responsible for their relations with Greenland and their citizens in Greenland. Greenland is represented internationally by the embassies and consulates of Denmark, although Greenland does directly participate in some Nordic organisations{{Which|date=January 2011}} which provide membership for dependent territories.
