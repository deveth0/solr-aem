&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Positive pressure&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a pressure within a system that is greater than the environment that surrounds that system. Consequently if there is any leak from the positively pressured system it will egress into the surrounding environment.

Use is also made of positive pressure to ensure there is no ingress of the environment into a supposed closed system. A typical example of the use of positive pressure is the location of a habitat in an area where there may exist flammable gases such as found on an [[oil platform]].

This kind of positive pressure also used on [[operating theater]]s and [[In vitro fertilisation|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;in vitro&amp;apos;&amp;apos; fertilisation]] (IVF) labs. To maintain positive pressure the room should be well sealed without any loop holes

Hospitals may have positive pressure rooms for patients with compromised [[immune system]]s. Air will flow out of the room instead of in, so that any airborne microorganisms (e.g., bacteria) that may infect the patient are kept away.

[[Amphibian]]s use this process to [[Respiration (physiology)|respire]], whereby they use positive pressure to inflate their [[lung]]s.

This process is important in human and chick development. Positive pressure, created by the closure of anterior and posterior [[neuropore]]s of the [[neural tube]] during [[neurulation]], is a requirement of [[brain]] development.
