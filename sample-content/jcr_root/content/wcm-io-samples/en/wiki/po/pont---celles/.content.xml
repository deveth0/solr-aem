[[Buzet, Belgium|Buzet]], [[Liberchies]], [[Luttre]], [[Obaix]], Pont-à-Celles (village that gave its name to the municipality), [[Thimeon]], [[Viesville]].

==Origin of the name==

Pont-à-Celles draws its name from Latin Cella, meaning room or cell of monk, probably because of the presence of the monastery founded in the 7th century, by [[Saint Amand]] (apostle of Belgium). The jurisdiction on which this primitive monastery was established, and then the priory of the Park, was called Celles, and later Pont-à-Celles.
The name of Pont-à-Celles appears for the first time during the 16th century, when the monks of the Park built a bridge on the Pieton river near to the church. The parishioners of Luttre and Hairiamont then had to cross the bridge for going to service (bridge to Celles, Pont-à-Celles). Gradually, this name extended to all the parish whose territory covered six seigniories. When in 1795, the French replaced these six seigniories by a newly created municipality, they adopted the name of the parish (Pont-à-Celles). In 1815, after the defeat of Napoleon in Waterloo, our territories were annexed to The Netherlands. With this occasion, the department of Jemappes (to which belonged Pont-à-Celles) became the province of Hainaut.

==Django Reinhardt==
The famous [[Jazz]] guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]] was born in [[Liberchies]]. Every May, the community honors him with the open air [[Django Reinhardt Jazz Festival]].
