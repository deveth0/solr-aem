&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pope Stephen VII&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-la|Stephanus PP. VII}}, {{lang-it|Stefano VII}}; died c. 15 March 931)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Archibald Bower, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The History of the Popes: from the foundation of the See of Rome to A.D. 1758&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1845), pg. 311&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was the [[Pope|head]] of the [[Catholic Church]] from February 929 to his death in 931. A candidate of the infamous [[Marozia]], his pontificate occurred during the period known as the [[Saeculum obscurum]].

Prior to his election, Stephen had been the [[cardinal-priest]] of [[Basilica di Sant&amp;apos;Anastasia al Palatino|St Anastasia]] in [[Rome]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;m189&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Very little is known about Stephen’s pontificate. During his two years as pope, Stephen confirmed the privileges of a few religious houses in France and Italy.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;m189&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; As a reward for helping free Stephen from the oppression of [[Hugh of Arles]], Stephen granted Cante di Gabrielli the position of papal governor of [[Gubbio]], and control over a number of key fortresses.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Collegio araldico, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rivista, Volume 5&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1907), pg. 49&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Stephen was also noted for the severity with which he treated clergy who strayed in their morals.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;DeCormenin, Louis Marie; Gihon, James L., &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Complete History of the Popes of Rome, from Saint Peter, the First Bishop to Pius the Ninth&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1857), pg. 287&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was also, apparently, according to a hostile Greek source from the twelfth century, the first pope who went around clean shaved whilst pope.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Mann, pg. 190&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Stephen died around 15 March 931, and was succeeded by [[Pope John XI]].
