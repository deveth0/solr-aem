A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;power kite&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;traction kite&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a large [[kite]] designed to provide significant pull to the user.

They come in three main forms: [[foil kite|foil]]s, [[leading edge inflatable kite|leading edge inflatables]] and [[supported leading edge]]. There are also [[rigid-framed power kite|rigid-framed kites]] and [[soft single skin kite]]s. There are several different [[kite control systems|control systems]] used with these kites which have two to five lines and a bar or handles. Most foil kites are made for use on land as they are &amp;quot;opened celled&amp;quot; so air flows in and out easily, this can be used as a safety feature to depower the kite. There are a few exceptions for this with new foils that use closed cell technology; they float on the water while you relaunch.

Power kites are generally used in conjunction with a vehicle or board, such as in:
* [[kitesurfing]] on a kiteboard
* [[kite buggy]]ing on a purpose-built 3-wheeled cart
* [[kite landboarding]] on an [[Mountainboarding|all-terrain/mountain/land board]]
* [[kite skating]] on all-terrain [[roller skates]]
* [[snowkiting]] on [[ski]]s or [[snowboard]]s
* [[kite jumping]], using a power kite for jumping above the ground
* [[Man-lifting kite|man lifting]], where a harnessed kite flier is [[Kite mooring|moored]] to the ground or one or more people to provide [[Tension (physics)|tension]] and [[Lift (force)|lift]]
* [[kiteboating]], on a boat

Research is also under way in the use of kites to [[Electricity generation|generate electric power]] to be fed into a [[power grid]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/aug/03/renewableenergy.energy |title=Giant kites to tap power of the high wind |first=Alok |last=Jha |work=The Observer |date=2008-08-03}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/10/71908 |title=Generating Power From Kites |first=Nicole |last=Martinelli |work=Wired.com |publisher=CondÃ© Nast Digital |date=2006-10-10 |date=2009-12-28}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://nextbigfuture.com/2008/08/competitors-for-kite-generated-wind.html |title=Competitors for kite generated wind power |publisher=Next Big Future |date=2008-08-04 |accessdate=2009-12-28}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kuleuven.be/optec/research/projects/kitepower |title=Kite Power |publisher=Optimisation in Engineering Center (OPTEC) Katholieke Universiteit Leuven |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2010-01-19}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Kites can be used to reach [[High altitude wind power|high altitude winds]] such as a [[jet stream]], which are always present, even if ground level [[wind]]s available to [[wind turbine]]s are absent.

Kites of related design are used for [[sailing]], including [[speed sailing]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jacob&amp;apos;s Ladder&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a [[Kiteboating|kite-powered boat]], set the C-Class [[Speed sailing record|world sailing speed record]] with a speed of {{convert|25|kn|km/h|lk=in}} in 1982, a record that stood for six years.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;WSSRC&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sailspeedrecords.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=78&amp;amp;Itemid=18 |title=500 Metre Records |work=WSSRC Records |publisher=World Sailing Speed Records Committee |accessdate=2009-12-28}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; A [[Kitesurfing|kiteboard]] was the first sailing craft to exceed a speed of {{convert|50|kn|km/h}} in October 2008.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;WSSRC&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Power kites range in size from {{convert|1.2|to|50|m2|ft2|abbr=on}}. All kites are made for specific purposes: some for water, land, power or maneuverability.
