        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Portland Pattern Repository&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;PPR&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a repository for [[Software design pattern|computer programming design pattern]]s. It was accompanied by a companion website, [[WikiWikiWeb]], which was the World&amp;apos;s first [[wiki]].

The repository has an emphasis on [[Extreme Programming]]. It is hosted by Cunningham &amp;amp; Cunningham (C2) of [[Portland, Oregon]] at http://c2.com/ppr/. The PPR&amp;apos;s [[motto]] is &amp;quot;[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PeopleProjectsAndPatterns People, Projects &amp;amp; Patterns].&amp;quot;

On 17 September 1987 programmer [[Ward Cunningham|Howard G. (Ward) Cunningham]], then with [[Tektronix]], and [[Apple Computer]]&amp;apos;s [[Kent Beck]] co-published the paper &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://c2.com/doc/oopsla87.html Using Pattern Languages for Object-Oriented Programs]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This paper about programming patterns was inspired by [[Christopher Alexander]]&amp;apos;s architectural concept of &amp;quot;patterns&amp;quot;. It was written for the 1987 [[OOPSLA]] programming conference organized by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]. Cunningham&amp;apos;s and Beck&amp;apos;s idea became popular among programmers, because it helped them exchange programming ideas in a format that is easy to understand.

Cunningham &amp;amp; Cunningham, the programming consultancy that would eventually host the PPR on its Internet domain, was incorporated in [[Salem, Oregon]] on 1 November 1991 and is named after Ward and his wife Karen R. Cunningham, a mathematician, school teacher, and school director. Cunningham &amp;amp; Cunningham registered their Internet domain c2.com on 23 October 1994.

Ward created the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Portland Pattern Repository&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on c2.com as a means to help [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented programmers]] publish their computer programming patterns by submitting them to him. Some of those programmers attended the OOPSLA and [http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/~plop/ PLoP] conferences about object-oriented programming, posting their ideas on the PPR and exchanging e-mail messages with Ward.

The PPR is accompanied on c2.com by the first ever [[wiki]]&amp;amp;mdash;a collection of reader-modifiable Web pages&amp;amp;mdash;which is called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[WikiWikiWeb]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and is located at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki.
