&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Poso&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the main port and transportation hub for the northeastern coast of [[Central Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]. Its geographical location is {{coord|1|24|S|120|45|E|}}.

Poso is the administrative capital of [[Poso Regency]] (one of ten [[Regency (Indonesia)|regencies]] in [[Central Sulawesi]] Province), is located exactly in the middle of the province on the shore of the [[Gulf of Tomini]], right in the central part of [[Sulawesi]] island, and is the main port and transportation hub for the northeastern coast of Sulawesi. It is not to be confused with [[Lake Poso]], which is some distance inland. With the total of population of over 200,000, Poso is one of the biggest and the oldest towns in the province.

The central location of Poso has made it a stopover either from the north to the south, or from west to the east of Sulawesi. It is for this reason that the population of Poso consists of many different ethnicities, religions and backgrounds. People living in Poso are spread from the coastal area to the mountainous region, with the main sources of income being farming and fishing.

== Tourism and culture ==
Poso can be reached by plane from [[Palu]] or by bus from many other big cities on Sulawesi, and is situated on the equator. It features tropical rain forest, seashore gardens and other natural scenery.

[[Modero]] is a well known traditional dance which is performed during celebration of [[rice]] harvesting (Padungku), usually in the evenings.

==Religious Conflict==
Since 1998, Poso has been the center of religious conflict between local Christians and Muslims.  Over 80,000 people were forced to flee the area, while at least 500 people have been killed in sporadic bouts of violence.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|last=Mydans|first=Seth|title=Jihad Seethes, and Grows on Indonesian Island|journal=the New York Times|date=January 10, 2002|year=2002|month=January|pages=A1}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
