{{Politics of Suriname}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Politics of Suriname&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Suriname]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[Plurality voting system|pluriform]] [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[National Assembly of Suriname|National Assembly]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

==Executive branch==
The executive branch is headed by the [[president]], who is elected by a two-thirds majority of the [[National Assembly of Suriname|National Assembly]] or, failing that twice, by a majority of the People&amp;apos;s Assembly for a 5-year term. If at least two-thirds of the National Assembly cannot agree to vote for one presidential candidate, a People&amp;apos;s Assembly is formed from all National Assembly delegates and regional and municipal [[Legislator|representatives]] who were elected by popular vote in the most recent national election. The [[Vice President of Suriname|Vice President]], normally elected at the same time as the president, is elected for a 5-year term, the same way as the president.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Suriname/english.html Constitution of Suriname, 1987 with reforms of 1992. See Article 83]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; As head of government, the president appoints a cabinet of ministers who are led in their day-to-day activities by the Vice President. There is no constitutional provision for removal or replacement of the president unless he resigns.

A 15-member [[Privy Council|State Advisory Council]] advises the president in the conduct of [[policy]]. Eleven of the 15 council seats are allotted by proportional representation of all political parties represented in the National Assembly. The president chairs the council, and two seats are allotted to representatives of labor, and two are to employers&amp;apos; organizations.
