In [[Greek mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Podarge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[English language|English translation]]: &amp;quot;fleet-foot&amp;quot;) referred to several different beings.

*One of the [[Harpy|Harpies]] is named Podarge and, due to her union with [[Zephyrus]], the god of the West Wind, was the mother of [[Balius]] and [[Balius and Xanthus|Xanthus]], the horses of [[Achilles]].
*The rainbow/messenger goddess [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]] (sister of the Harpies) is sometimes also referred to as Podarge.
*Podarces was [[Priam]]&amp;apos;s birth name.  He changed it after buying his life from [[Heracles]] with a golden veil embroidered by his sister, [[Hesione]].  Priam was interpreted as &amp;quot;ransomed&amp;quot; (as if from πρίασθαι &amp;quot;to have bought&amp;quot;) by [[folk etymology]].
