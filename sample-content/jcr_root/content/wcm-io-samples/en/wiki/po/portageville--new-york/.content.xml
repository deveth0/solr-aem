&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Portageville&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Hamlet|hamlet]] located in the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of [[Genesee Falls, New York|Genesee Falls]] in [[Wyoming County, New York]]. Its name derives from the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] canoeists who would withdraw their craft from the river to avoid going over three waterfalls in the [[Genesee River]] gorge. They had to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;portage&amp;apos;&amp;apos; several miles to the site of present day [[Mount Morris, New York|Mount Morris]] where they could embark for the rest of the journey downriver.

Portageville is the only named community in the town of Genesee Falls.

The Genesee River Gorge with its scenic waterfalls was formed after the original valley was buried in [[glacier|glacial]] debris from the last ice age and the river had to cut a new valley though the [[Devonian]] sedimentary rock of the area. It has also been called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Grand Canyon of the East&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The site has now been designated [[Letchworth State Park]] and is a major tourist attraction, with the upper entrance at Portage.

The [[First Universalist Church of Portageville]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2008.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nris&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
