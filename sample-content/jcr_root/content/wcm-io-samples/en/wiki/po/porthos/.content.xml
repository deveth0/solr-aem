&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Porthos, Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[fictional character]] in the novels &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Three Musketeers]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Twenty Years After]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]]. He and the other two [[musketeer]]s [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]] and [[Aramis]] are friends of the novel&amp;apos;s protagonist, [[d&amp;apos;Artagnan]] (see [[D&amp;apos;Artagnan Romances]]). He carries a sword that Aramis nicknamed Balizarde.

In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Three Musketeers&amp;apos;&amp;apos; his [[family name]] is du Vallon. In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Twenty Years After&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, after a successful wedding, he is first known as du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds, then he earns the title of [[baron]].

Porthos, honest and slightly gullible, is the extrovert of the group, enjoying wine, women and song. Though he is often seen as the comic relief, he is also extremely dedicated and loyal toward his friends and fellow Musketeers. His eating abilities even impress [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] during a banquet at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. As the story advances, he looks more and more of a giant, and his death is that of a [[titan (mythology)|titan]].

At the time of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Three Musketeers&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ca. 1627) he apparently has few lands or other resources to draw from.  He was finally able to extract sufficient funds from an elderly lawyer&amp;apos;s somewhat younger wife (whom he was romancing) to equip himself for the [[Siege of La Rochelle]].

The fictional Porthos is very loosely based on the historical [[musketeer]] [[Isaac de Porthau]].
