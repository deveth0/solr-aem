[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 065.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Joseph Accused by Potiphar&amp;apos;s Wife, by [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], 1655.]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Potiphar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Potifar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|t|ɨ|f|ər}}&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Hebrew Name 2 |hebrew1=פּוֹטִיפַר |hebrew2=פּוֹטִיפָר |stan1=Potifar |tiber1=Pôṭîp̄ar |tiber2=Pôṭîp̄ār}} ; [[Arabic]]: بوتيفار ; [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] origin: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{unicode|p-di-p-rʿ}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;he whom [[Ra]] gave&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; is a person in the [[Book of Genesis]]&amp;apos;s account of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]. Potiphar is said to be the [[Captain of the Guard|captain]] of the [[Royal Guard|palace guard]] and is referred to without name in the Quran. [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]], sold into slavery by his brothers, is taken to Egypt where he is sold to Potiphar as a household slave. Potiphar makes Joseph the head of his household, but Potiphar&amp;apos;s wife, furious at Joseph for resisting her attempts to seduce him, accuses him falsely of attempted rape. Potiphar casts Joseph into prison, where he comes to the notice of [[Pharaoh]] through his ability to [[Dream interpretation|interpret the dreams]] of other prisoners.

Potiphar&amp;apos;s wife [[List of names for the biblical nameless|is named in neither the Bible]] nor the [[Quran]]. The mediaeval [[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer HaYashar]], a commentary on the [[Torah]], gives it as [[Zuleika (legendary)|Zuleikha]], as do many Islamic traditions and thus the Persian poem called [[Yusuf and Zulaikha]] (from [[Jami]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Haft Awrang]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Seven thrones&amp;quot;)). Because of the Egyptian location wherein the scene is staged, it is not impossible to detect in this biblical tale also a more recent echo of the very old Egyptian [[Tale of Two Brothers|fable of the two brothers Bata and Anpu]].{{fact|date=July 2013}}

==Historical evidence==
It is difficult to place Potiphar or Joseph accurately to a particular pharaoh or time period. On the [[Jewish calendar]], Joseph was purchased in the year 2216, which is 1544 BC, at the end of the [[Second Intermediate Period]] or very beginning of the [[New Kingdom]]. The original scriptures (Torah as translated in the King James version Bible) are complete and predate other referenced historical evidence by 1700 years and thus should be considered as such in the formulation of hypothesis based on other sources such as the Quran, theatrical compositions, poetry, and other dated story-telling, all of which can add to the richness and understanding of the account.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} According to the [[documentary hypothesis]], the story of Potiphar and his wife derives from the [[Yahwist]] source, and stands in the same place that the stories of the butler and the baker and Pharaoh&amp;apos;s dreams stand in the [[Elohist]] text. According to Dr. G.J. Wenham ([[Inter-Varsity Press|IVP]] New Bible Commentary) execution was normal for rape cases, so Potiphar may have had doubts about his wife&amp;apos;s story.

==Cultural references==
*In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Divine Comedy]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Dante]] sees the shade of Potiphar&amp;apos;s wife in the eighth circle of [[Hell]]. She does not speak, but Dante is told by another spirit that, along with other [[perjury|perjurers]], she is condemned to suffer a burning [[fever]] for all eternity.
*In the [[John Sayles]] film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Matewan]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Will Oldham]] plays a young minister boy who preaches the story of Potiphar to his small town.
*In [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]&amp;apos;s musical &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Potiphar is a tycoon of ancient Egypt who made his wealth through buying shares in pyramids, (&amp;quot;Potiphar had made a huge pile, owned a large percentage of the Nile&amp;quot;). His wife is a seductive [[man-eater]]. Both feature in the song &amp;quot;Potiphar&amp;quot;.
*In [[John Keats]]&amp;apos; poem, &amp;quot;On Fame&amp;quot;, Keats calls Fame &amp;quot;Sister-in-law to jealous Potiphar&amp;quot;.
*In the animated film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Joseph: King of Dreams]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, prior to having him jailed for allegedly assaulting his wife, Potiphar takes notice of Joseph&amp;apos;s intelligence and makes him a chief slave in his household. He later brings Joseph to Pharaoh, who is plagued by inexplicable dreams, and expresses deep regret for having Joseph put in prison. He tells Pharaoh that he trusts Joseph &amp;quot;with [his] life.&amp;quot;
