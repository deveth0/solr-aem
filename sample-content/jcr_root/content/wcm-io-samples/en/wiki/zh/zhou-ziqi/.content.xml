&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zhōu Zìqí&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Wade-Giles]] Chow Tzu-ch&amp;apos;i) 周自齊 (17 November 1869 - 21 October 1923), was a Chinese politician in the late [[Qing dynasty]] and early [[History of the Republic of China|republican period]]. He was a member of the [[Communications Clique]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Guangdong]] and spoke both [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] and Mandarin but he later moved back to his ancestral province of [[Shandong]].  He received higher education in the [[United States]] at [[Columbia University]].  Upon returning to China, he founded [[Tsinghua University]] for the purpose of preparing students (in English and science and math) to study in America, while he was in charge of sending students to study in America.   He also served as president of the university in 1911.

As the governor of Shandong Province, he supported [[Yuan Shikai]] to reverse China from a (people-governing) republic to an empire (monarch) because he believed that the Chinese people, with 98% illiteracy, were not ready to govern themselves. They could only be manipulated by politicians and bring instability and chaos to the country. He later held the following positions: President of Bank of China, Minister of Communication, Minister of Military, Minister of Finance, Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, and the Inspector General of Salt.

He helped leak information about [[Twenty-One Demands]] of the [[Empire of Japan]] to the media.  Zhou may have invited Columbia University political scientist [[Frank Johnson Goodnow]] to justify monarchism for China.

During Yuan&amp;apos;s monarchic attempt, he was sent to Japan as a special envoy.  The Japanese government under [[Okuma Shigenobu]] rejected him and he returned to tell Yuan that his government lost foreign support.  In 1916, Zhou fled to Japan after President [[Li Yuanhong]] ordered the arrest of Yuan&amp;apos;s eight top monarchists.  He returned to China after the charges were dropped in February 1918.

1915 He initiated a National Day for Planting Trees, which is carried on until this day in Taiwan (they only changed the day he designated from [[Qingming]] to the date of death of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, March 12);
1916 He was wanted as the &amp;quot;traitor of the Republic&amp;quot; for supporting Yuan Shikai&amp;apos;s monarchy and took asylum in Japan;
1918 He was pardoned by President Feng Guozhang
1920 He was appointed as the Minister of Finance

As [[Xu Shichang]]&amp;apos;s finance minister, he lost in a power struggle against Premier [[Jin Yunpeng]] in 1921 and was compelled to resign.  Seeking revenge, he convinced [[Zhang Zuolin]] to replace Jin with [[Liang Shiyi]], the head of the civilian [[Communications Clique]].  He later served as [[List of premiers of China|acting premier]] and [[President of the Republic of China|acting president]] briefly in 1922 after Xu resigned.  His presidency, the shortest in Chinese history, was interim as the [[Zhili clique]] tried to woo [[Li Yuanhong]] back into office.  Complaining of Zhili interference, he left for the US to study film-making and returned to China to start a studio.  He died the following year.

His surviving wife was beheaded by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] at her Beijing home during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Her fourth daughter was forced to witness the scene and lost her mind.
