&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zhang Bu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (died 264) was a military general of [[Eastern Wu]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period of [[History of China|Chinese history]]. Zhang served as the Left General. Through the orders of the emperor [[Sun Xiu (emperor)|Sun Xiu]], Zhang, along with Right General [[Ding Feng (elder)|Ding Feng]], overthrew the regent [[Sun Chen]] in a coup. Zhang afterwards supported [[Sun Hao]]&amp;apos;s ascent to the throne of Eastern Wu, but ended up being killed for criticizing the brutality of Sun Hao. Zhang was one of many that were executed by the hands of Sun Hao simply because they did not agree with his tyranny.
