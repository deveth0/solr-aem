&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zhong Kui&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|c=鍾馗|p= Zhōng Kuí}}; [[Wade-Giles]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chung Kwei&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shōki&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a figure of [[Chinese mythology]]. Traditionally regarded as a vanquisher of ghosts and evil beings, and reputedly able to command 80,000 demons, his image is often painted on household gates as a guardian spirit, as well as in places of business where high-value goods are involved.

==Becoming the king of ghosts==

According to folklore, Zhong Kui travelled with Du Ping (杜平), a friend from his hometown, to take part in the [[imperial examination]]s at the capital. Though Zhong achieved top honours in the exams, his title of &amp;quot;zhuangyuan&amp;quot; was stripped by the emperor because of his disfigured appearance. In anger, Zhong Kui committed suicide upon the palace steps by hurling himself against the palace gate until his head was broken. Du Ping buried him. During his judgment, the [[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Hell King]] saw potential in Zhong. Intelligent enough to score top honors in the imperial examinations, but damned to hell because he committed suicide. The Hell King (judge) then gave him the time, as king of ghost, forever to hunt, capture, maintain and order ghosts.  After Zhong became king of ghosts in [[Diyu|Hell]], he returned to his hometown on [[Chinese New Year|Chinese New Year&amp;apos;s Eve]]. To repay Du Ping&amp;apos;s kindness, Zhong Kui gave his younger sister in marriage to Du.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Singh1997&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|author=Nagendra Kumar Singh|title=International encyclopaedia of Buddhism: India [11]|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x-5OAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=7 June 2013|year=1997|publisher=Anmol Publications|isbn=978-81-7488-156-4|pages=1372-1374}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Popularization in later dynasties==

Zhong Kui&amp;apos;s popularity in folklore can be traced to the reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang China]] (712 to 756). According to [[Song Dynasty]] sources, once the Emperor Xuanzong was gravely ill. He had a dream in which he saw two ghosts. The smaller of the ghosts stole a purse from imperial consort [[Yang Guifei]] and a flute belonging to the emperor. The bigger ghost, wearing the hat of an official, captured the smaller ghost, tore out his eye and ate it. The bigger ghost then introduced himself as Zhong Kui. He said that he had sworn to rid the empire of evil. When the emperor awoke, he had recovered from his illness. So he commissioned the court painter [[Wu Daozi]] to produce an image of Zhong Kui to show to the officials. This was highly influential to later representations of Zhong.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Glahn2004&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Von Glahn|title=The Sinister Way: The Divine and the Demonic in Chinese Religious Culture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iyvBvYoIZmsC&amp;amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=7 June 2013|year=2004|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92877-0|pages=122–128}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
