{{unreferenced|date=December 2011}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 州, [[pinyin]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhōu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) were [[History of the political divisions of China|historical political divisions]] of [[China]]. Formally established during the [[Han Dynasty]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; continued to exist until the establishment of the [[Republic of China]]—a period of over 2000 years. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were also previously used in [[Provinces of Korea#Provinces of Unified Silla|Korea]] ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 주, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ju&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), [[Historical provinces of Vietnam|Vietnam]] ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;châu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), and [[Provinces of Japan|Japan]] ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 州, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;shū&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is typically rendered by several terms in the English language:
*The large &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; before the [[Tang Dynasty]] and in countries other than China are called &amp;quot;provinces&amp;quot;
*The smaller &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; during and after the [[Tang Dynasty]] are called &amp;quot;prefectures&amp;quot;{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
*The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the [[Qing Dynasty]] are also called either &amp;quot;independent&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;dependent departments&amp;quot;, depending on their level.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

[[File:Zhejiang_1773-1820.jpg|thumb|300px|A mid-Qing map of [[Zhejiang]] Provinces, with all prefectural capitals indicated (杭州府 [[Hangzhou]]-fu, 温州府 [[Wenzhou]]-fu,  金华府 [[Jinhua]]-fu, etc.). South is on top.]]
The [[Tang Dynasty]] also established prefectures (府, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;fǔ&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of special importance such as capitals and other major cities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  By the Ming and Qing,&amp;apos;&amp;apos;fǔ&amp;apos;&amp;apos; became predominant divisions within Chinese provinces. The word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;fǔ&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (府) was typically attached to the name of each prefecture&amp;apos;s capital city, thus both Chinese and Western maps and geographical works would often call the respective cities [[Hangzhou]]-fu, [[Wenzhou]]-fu, [[Wuchang]]-fu, etc.

Following the [[Meiji Restoration]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;fu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was also used in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] for the urban [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] of the most important cities; today, it is still used in the Japanese names for the [[Osaka Prefecture|Osaka]] and [[Kyoto Prefecture]]s.

In [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China|modern China]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; today exists only in the designation &amp;quot;[[autonomous prefecture]]&amp;quot; (自治州, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zìzhìzhōu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), administrative areas for China&amp;apos;s [[List of Chinese nationalities|designated minorities]]. However, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; have left a huge mark on the [[toponym|place name]]s of [[China]], including the province of [[Guizhou]] and the major cities of [[Guangzhou]], [[Fuzhou]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Lanzhou]], and [[Suzhou]], among many others. Likewise, although modern Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese provinces are no longer designated by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; cognates, the older terms survive in various place names, notably the Japanese islands of [[Honshu]] and [[Kyushu]], the Korean province [[Jeju-do]], and [[Lai Châu]] in Vietnam.

==History==
{{see|History of the political divisions of China}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were first mentioned in ancient Chinese texts, notably the &amp;quot;[[Tribute of Yu]]&amp;quot; (禹貢, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yǔ Gòng&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) section of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Classic of History]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. All agreed on the division of China into [[Nine Provinces (China)|nine &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], though they differed on their names and position. These &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were geographical concepts, not administrative entities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The [[Han Dynasty]] was the first to formalize the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; into actual administrative divisions by establishing 13 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; all across China. Because these &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were the largest divisions of the China at the time, they are usually translated as &amp;quot;provinces&amp;quot;. After the Han Dynasty, however, the number of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; began to increase. By the time of the [[Sui Dynasty]], there were over a hundred &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; all across China.

The Sui and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang dynasties]] merged &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; with the next level down, the [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] (郡, pinyin: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;jùn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). The Tang also added another level on top: the [[circuit (political division)|circuit]]. Henceforth, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were lowered to second-level status, and the word becomes translated into English as &amp;quot;prefecture&amp;quot;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Thereafter, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; continued to survive as second- or third-level political divisions until the [[Qing Dynasty]].

The [[Republic of China]] abolished &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; altogether, leaving the word only in the names of cities such as [[Guangzhou]] and [[Hangzhou]]. The [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China]] recycled the name, using it to refer to the [[autonomous prefecture]]s granted to various ethnicities.
