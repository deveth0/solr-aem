        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zheng Wenguang&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|c=郑文光|p=Zhèng Wén Guāng}}, 9 April 1929 - 17 June 2003) was a Chinese science fiction writer.

Zheng was born in [[Vietnam]], but moved to [[China]] in 1947. He was first published in 1954 and continued to write until a stroke in 1983. That stated he had to quit writing science fiction during the [[Cultural Revolution]] due to official pressure.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200306/17/eng20030617_118407.shtml People&amp;apos;s Daily]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He also was a research fellow at the Beijing Astronomical Observatory. In the West he might be best known for the story &amp;quot;The Mirror Image of the Earth&amp;quot;, which was reprinted in at least two anthologies.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sfwa.org/News/zheng.htm SFWA News]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
