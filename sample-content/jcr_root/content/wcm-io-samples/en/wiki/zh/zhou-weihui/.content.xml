}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; as  &amp;quot;decadent&amp;quot;. Her latest novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Marrying Buddha]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (我的禅) (2005) was censored, modified and published in China under a modified title. She is often associated with [[Mian Mian]], another slightly older member of the so-called &amp;quot;New Generation&amp;quot;.

==Education==
Zhou Weihui, known in the West as Wei Hui, studied [[Chinese Language]] and [[Chinese Literature|Literature]] at [[Fudan University]] in [[Shanghai]], after a year of [[military]] training.

==Published works==
Her first [[short story]] was published at the age of 21. Her first novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Shanghai Baby]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was a local [[bestseller]] in [[Shanghai]]. Soon after its publication, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shanghai Baby&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was banned by the [[Government of the People&amp;apos;s Republic of China|Chinese government]] because of the novel&amp;apos;s explicit sexual scenes and bold portrait of China&amp;apos;s new generation. The publishing house that published the novel was temporarily closed for 3 months. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shanghai Baby&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was published overseas where it became an international bestseller. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shanghai Baby&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has been translated into 34 different languages and has sold over six million copies in 45 countries. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shanghai Baby&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has sold more copies than any other work of Chinese contemporary literature.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Marrying Buddha]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Weihui&amp;apos;s second novel and a sequel to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shanghai Baby&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was published in 2005 and became another international bestseller. Like &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shanghai Baby&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the novel is again narrated by Coco, a thinly disguised Weihui.  Coco is described by Weihui as a &amp;apos;representative of socially and sexually liberated Chinese young women&amp;apos;. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marrying Buddha&amp;apos;&amp;apos; continues Coco&amp;apos;s journey of self-discovery in terms of her sexuality.

Apart from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shanghai Baby&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marrying Buddha&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Zhou Weihui has published four other books in Chinese and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]:

# &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Shriek of the Butterfly&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
# &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Virgin in the Water&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
# &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Crazy Like Weihui&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
# &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Desire Pistol&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

==Film adaptation ==
A German [[film]] adaptation of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shanghai Baby&amp;apos;&amp;apos; starring [[Bai Ling]] was released in 2007, but has not been released outside of film festivals.

==Influence==
Wei Hui has been regarded by international media as a spokeswoman of the new generation of Chinese young women. She has presented her work in a large number of Western publications, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The New York Times]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The New Yorker]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Time (magazine)|Time]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[CNN]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[USA Today]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the [[BBC]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Times]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Sunday Times]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Economist]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Welt am Sonntag]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Asahi Shimbun]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[NHK]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Le Monde]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ND &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Le Figaro]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
