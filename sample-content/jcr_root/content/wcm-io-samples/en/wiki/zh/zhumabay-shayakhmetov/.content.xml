&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zhumabay Shayakhmetovich Shayakhmetov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ({{lang-ru|Жумабай Шаяхметов}}), (30 August 1902 &amp;amp;ndash; 17 October 1966) was a [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Communist]] [[political figure]].  From 1946 through 1954, he was First Secretary of the [[Communist Party]] of the [[Kazakh SSR]].

He was born to a poor peasant family in a small village in Borisov County ([[okrug]]), which in 1924 was incorporated as one of the nine rural areas in the [[Sherbakulsky District]] of the [[Omsk Oblast]].  In 1915, he went to the two-year Kazakh-Russian school in what is now the Poltava Raion, graduating in 1917.  He attended the Narimanov Institute in [[Moscow]], but did not complete his first year.  In 1919, he got a job as a school teacher in a rural school, but the school closed due to the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] and he returned to his home.

From 1919 to 1926, Shayakhmetov was the secretary of the Turkoman Rural District executive committee of the [[State Political Directorate|GPU]]. By 1923, he was already a first-rate agent, solving crimes in the [[Cherlaksky District|Cherlaksky District, Omsk Oblast]]. From 1926 to 1928, Shayakhmetov taught office management (official documentation) as the political instructor in a rural organization called &amp;quot;Koschi&amp;quot; in the [[Petropavl]] Okrug. From 1928 to 1938, he worked for the [[NKVD]], first as Deputy Department Chief for the [[North Kazakhstan Province|North Kazakhstan Oblast]], then as the Deputy Department Chief for the [[Almaty Province|Alma Ata Oblast]].

From 1938 to 1946, Shayakhmetov worked his way up from Third Secretary to First Secretary of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party]] of the Kazakh SSR. He was the first ethnic Kazakh to hold that post.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Zardykhan, Zharmukhamed (2004) &amp;quot;Russians in Kazakhstan and demographic change: imperial legacy and the Kazakh way of nation building&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Asian Ethnicity&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 5(1): pp. 61-79, p. 65&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In March 1954, Shayakhmetov was replaced as First Secretary by [[Panteleimon Ponomarenko|Panteleimon Kondratyevich Ponomarenko]], a Russian, as part of [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev&amp;apos;s]] post-Stalin reorganization. For about a year, well into 1955, he was the First Secretary of the [[South Kazakhstan Province|South Kazakhstan provincial]] committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, before he was removed from that post as well.

He served as [[Chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities]] (1950&amp;amp;ndash;1954).
