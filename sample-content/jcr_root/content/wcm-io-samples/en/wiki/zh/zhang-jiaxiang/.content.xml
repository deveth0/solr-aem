&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zhang Jiaxiang&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born in Oct. 1932), also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chia-Hsiang Chang&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a Chinese [[astronomer]] affiliated with [[Purple Mountain Observatory]], Chinese Academy of Sciences, and president of the Minor Planet Foundation at that observatory.

He discovered [[asteroid]] [[(5384) 1957 VA]] (credited as C.-H. Chang).

==Biography==
Zhang Jiaxiang, astronomer, was born in Oct. 1932 in [[Nanjing]], [[Jiangsu province]]. In 1951, he first joined the Purple Mountain Observatory as a technician, supervised by director [[Zhang Yuzhe]].

In 1957, Zhang Yuzhe and Zhang Jiaxiang worked together and published a paper discussing the orbit of artificial satellite. From 1965 to 1972, Prof. Zhang led a research group to accomplish the project of orbit determination of the first Chinese [[artificial satellite]] and thereafter the systematic studies of the orbit of Chinese synchronous satellite. In total, they have discovered more than 150 internationally numbered new [[minor planets]] and four [[comet]]s. In the 1990s, he accurately predicted a series of collision times between 19 comet nuclei and Jupiter, based on his self-established numerical model of the [[solar system]] dynamics. In the most recent 10 years, he was named as the chief scientist, leading a  project of “Construction of Near Earth Object Telescope，” which has been successfully completed.

To recognize his contribution in his field, Harvard Smithsonian Observatory in [[Boston]] named an asteroid they discovered “Jiaxiang” in 1991.
