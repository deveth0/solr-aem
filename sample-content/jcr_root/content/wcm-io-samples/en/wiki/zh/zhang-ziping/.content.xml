&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zhang Ziping&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|t=張資平|s=张资平|p=Zhāng Zīpíng|j=Cheung1 Ji1 Peng4}}) (1893–1959) was a [[China|Chinese]] writer born in [[Mei County, Guangdong|Meixian]], [[Meizhou]], [[Guangdong]]

==Biography==
Zhang received a classical education and, after studying in [[Japan]] from 1912, received a degree in [[geology]] from [[Tokyo Imperial University]] in 1922. On his return to China, he engaged in various business ventures, wrote, taught geology and literature. However, he eventually decided on a literary career, and with [[Yu Dafu]], [[Guo Moruo]] and [[Tian Han]] he co-founded the &amp;quot;Creation Society&amp;quot; which promoted vernacular and modern literature. He worked as an editor of their [[literary magazine]] and it was during this time that he published the semi-autobiographical &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fossils in Alluvial Deposits&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (冲积期化石, 1922), his first novel and arguably the first long-form fiction work of the May 4 Period.[http://www.cqvip.com/onlineread/onlineread.asp?ID=22911287]

Zhang went on to pursue a successful career as a novelist, writing stories of torrid love triangles that were popular with audiences but panned by critics. In an essay later collected in the volume &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Two Minds&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Lu Xun wrote that Zhang&amp;apos;s complete works could be distilled to a single symbol: a triangle.[http://www.my285.com/xdwx/luxun/erxinji/034.htm]

After leaving the Creation Society in the 1928, he started up his own publisher, Liqun Books, through which he issued books and a literary journal. His output of fiction slackened after the early 1930s, and by the middle of the decade he was mainly writing science books and doing translations from the Japanese. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Modern Scarlet Letter&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (新红A字), a romance set in wartime Shanghai and published in 1945, was his final novel.

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] he worked for the collaborationist [[Wang Jingwei Government]] in the Department of Agriculture and Mining, and later edited a journal for the Sino-Japanese Culture Association. After the defeat of the [[Empire of Japan]] he was arrested and tried by the [[Kuomingtang]] government for [[treason]] in 1947. In early 1948 he was sentenced to fifteen months in prison, and was released in early 1949.

During the early years of the People&amp;apos;s Republic, Zhang taught geology in Shanghai and continued his translation and editing work. In June 1955 he was arrested for being a counter-revolutionary, and in September 1958 was sentenced to 20 years in prison. In 1959 he was sent to a labor farm in Anhui, where he died on December 2.
