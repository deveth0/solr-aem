&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zhao Changqing&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born April 1969), a history teacher and [[political activist]] in the [[People’s Republic of China]].

==Biography==
Zhao hails from a small village in [[Shaanxi|Shaanxi province]], [[People’s Republic of China|China]]. In September 1988, he entered the History department of the Shaanxi teacher training college.

===Student activism===
In April 1989, he and a group of classmates started a students’ self-governing committee.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.laogai.org/dissent/show.php?code=671&amp;amp;n=| title = Prisoners in P. R. China (Chinese)|accessdate = 3 August 2006| publisher = Laogai.org }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Arrested in June 1989 for taking part in the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], he was imprisoned in Xincheng prison in Beijing for more than half a year, but was then discharged and sent back to his old school in Shaanxi, where he graduated in 1992.

From his graduation until 1998, Zhao worked as a teacher at the Shaanxi Hanzhong Nuclear Industry Factory 813.

===Petition to the 15th National Congress===
In August 1997, he petitioned the 15th [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China]] to introduce political reforms with his essay &amp;quot;Reform the political system and take the path to democratisation&amp;quot;. In defense of fellow workers against corruption and substandard working conditions, he tried to stand for election as a factory representative to the National People Congress, on a platform critical of the [[All China Federation of Trade Unions]]. He was detained on 25 March 1998, and was tried on 6 September 1998 and sentenced to 3 years imprisonment.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.nlcnet.org/campaigns/archive/chinareport/unionprisioners.shtml | title = Labor Activists Imprisoned in China |date = 28 February 2000| publisher = National Labor Committee }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

===Petition to the 16th National Congress===
In November 2002, he was responsible for drafting the [[Open letter to the Sixteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China]] and collecting 192 signatures to support his demands for democracy. Zhao was charged with &amp;quot;attempted subversion of state power&amp;quot; and tried behind closed doors at the [[Xian]] People&amp;apos;s Court on 10 July 2003. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment for his crimes.

[[HRIC]] president [[Liu Qing (activist)|Liu Qing]] denounced the trial for being &amp;quot;just another form of intimidation through an unfair legal process. It is especially objectionable that a trial over an open letter was held in secret on the pretext of protecting state secrets&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.justresponse.net/Zhao_appeal.html | title = Appeal for release of Zhao Changqing |date = 3 September 2003  | publisher = Just Response }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

===Imprisonment===
In December 2005, he refused to participate in a flag-raising ceremony and refused to sing the [[national anthem]], and was put into [[solitary confinement]] for 40 days. On 18 February 2006, he was again punished with solitary confinement for 3 months for refusing to take part in military drills and for receiving [[Falun Gong]] members.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.laogai.org/dissent/show.php?code=671&amp;amp;n=| title = Prisoners in P. R. China (Chinese) |accessdate = 3 August 2006| publisher = Laogai.org }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He remains in prison and is on [[Amnesty International]]&amp;apos;s watch list.
