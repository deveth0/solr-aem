&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zhan Ziqian&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|c=展子虔|p=Zhǎn Zǐqián|w=&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chan Tzu-ch&amp;apos;ien&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}) (c. mid to late 6th century)&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Barnhart&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Barnhart: Page 371.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was a famous [[Painting|painter]] of ancient [[China]] from Yangxin county (阳信县), [[Shandong]] province. His birth and death dates are unknown. It is known that in the [[Sui dynasty]] (581 – 618)  he was appointed to the office of Chaosan Dafu (朝散大夫) and later of Zhangnei Dudu (帐内都督).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Cihai1075&amp;quot;&amp;gt;CiHai: Page 1075.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

According to the historical documents, Zhan Ziquan painted a number of genres and religion paintings which have not survived. He was especially noted for his paintings of pavilions and people, and horses. His paintings of people were particularly lifelike.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Cihai1075&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; The only painting by him that survives today is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Strolling About in Spring&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which is a perspective arrangement of mountains.
