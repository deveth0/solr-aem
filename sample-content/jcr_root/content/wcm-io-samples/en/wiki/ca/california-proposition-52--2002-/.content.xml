&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Proposition 52&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[California ballot proposition]] on the November 5, 2002 ballot. It failed to pass with 2,808,240 (40.6%) votes in favor and 4,108,362 (59.4%) against. It would allow [[Election Day voter registration]], removing the deadline to [[Voter registration|register to vote]], which was 15 days prior to an election. It was placed on the ballot through the [[initiative]] process.

The question before voters was:
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Should legally eligible California residents presenting proof of current residence be allowed to register to vote on Election Day?&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

== Official summary ==
*Allows persons who are legally eligible to vote and have valid identification to register to vote on election day at their polling place.
*Increases criminal penalty for voter and voter registration fraud.
*Criminalizes [[Conspiracy (law)|conspiracy]] to commit voter fraud.
*Requires trained staff at polling places to manage election day registration, creates fund to implement measure, including training and providing personnel for election day registration.
*Allows persons to register or reregister during 28 days preceding election day at local election offices.
*Provides more time to county election officials to prepare voter registration lists.

Summary of Legislative Analyst&amp;apos;s Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact:

*Annual state costs of about $6 million to fund counties for election day voter registration activities, thereby resulting in no anticipated net county cost.
*Minor state administrative costs and unknown, but probably minor, state costs to enforce a new [[election fraud]] offense.
