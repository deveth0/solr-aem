The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cairo Conference&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (codenamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sextant&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;WSC_Closing the Ring&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Churchill|first=Winston Spencer|title=The Second World War: Closing the Ring |year=1951|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston|pages=642}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) of November 22–26, 1943, held in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], outlined the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] position against [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] during [[World War II]] and made decisions about postwar [[Asia]]. The meeting was attended by [[President of the United States]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Winston Churchill]], and Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]] did not attend the conference because Chiang was attending, which could cause friction between the Soviet Union and Japan. (The [[Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact]] of 1941 was a five-year agreement of neutrality between the two nations; in 1943 the Soviet Union was not at war with Japan, whereas China, the U.K. and the U.S. were.)

The Cairo meeting was held at a residence of the American Ambassador to Egypt, [[Alexander Comstock Kirk|Alexander Kirk]], near [[Giza Necropolis|the Pyramids]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Life&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: [http://books.google.com/books?id=1UkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA80&amp;amp; Noel F. Busch, &amp;quot;Alexander Kirk,&amp;quot; August 13, 1945], accessed January 23, 2011&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Two days later Stalin met with Roosevelt and Churchill in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]] for the [[Tehran Conference]].

The [[Cairo Declaration]] was issued on 27 November 1943 and released in a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cairo Communiqué&amp;apos;&amp;apos; through radio on 1 December 1943,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;cairo_communique&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/shiryo/01/002_46shoshi.html|publisher=Japan National Diet Library|title=Cairo Communique, December 1, 1943|date=December 1, 1943}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; stating the Allies&amp;apos; intentions to continue deploying military force until Japan&amp;apos;s [[unconditional surrender]]. The three main clauses of the Cairo Declaration are that &amp;quot;Japan be stripped of all the islands in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied since the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as [[Manchuria]], [[Taiwan|Formosa]], and the [[Penghu|Pescadores]], shall be restored to the Republic of China&amp;quot;, and that &amp;quot;in due course [[Korea]] shall become free and independent&amp;quot;.
