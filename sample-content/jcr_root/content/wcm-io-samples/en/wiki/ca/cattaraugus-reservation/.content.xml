&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cattaraugus Reservation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[Indian reservation]] of the [[Seneca tribe|Seneca]] Indian Nation of the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy located in [[New York]]. As of the 2000 census, the Indian reservation had a total population of 2,412. Its total area is about 34.4&amp;amp;nbsp;mi² (89.1&amp;amp;nbsp;km²). It is divided among three counties for census purposes:

* [[Cattaraugus Reservation, Chautauqua County, New York|Cattaraugus Reservation, Chautauqua County]]
* [[Cattaraugus Reservation, Erie County, New York|Cattaraugus Reservation, Erie County]]
The reservation stretches from [[Lake Erie]] inward along [[Cattaraugus Creek]], along either side of [[New York State Route 438|NY 438]]. There is a small cluster of Seneca-owned businesses along [[U.S. Highway 20|US 20]] and [[New York State Route 5|NY 5]] where they cross through the reservation, including a Bingo Hall with a Poker Room and various video [[slot machine]]s. [[Interstate 90]] crosses through the reservation with the closest exit being in [[Irving, New York]]. In Erie County, the reservation is bordered by the Towns of [[Brant, New York|Brant]], [[North Collins, New York|North Collins]], and [[Collins, New York|Collins]]; in Cattaraugus County by the Town of [[Perrysburg (town), New York|Perrysburg]]; and in Chautauqua County by the Town of [[Hanover, New York|Hanover]]. (At the reservation&amp;apos;s southeast corner, near the village of [[Gowanda, New York|Gowanda]], it comes literally within a few feet of bordering the Town of [[Persia, New York|Persia]] in Cattaraugus County, but does not actually do so.)

The reservation is mostly rural, with one-family homes along Route 438 interspersed with businesses such as [[tobacco]] shops. The reservation is divided into several communities such as Newtown, Bucktown, Pinewoods, Eleven Acres, Ozarks and Indian Hill. At the center of the reservation along Route 438 are the [[Seneca Nation]] government offices, Head Start/Daycare Center, Community buildings and the volunteer fire department.

Former NFL player [[Buck Jones]] is from here.
