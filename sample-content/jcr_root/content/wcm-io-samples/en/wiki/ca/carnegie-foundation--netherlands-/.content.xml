The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Carnegie Foundation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-nl|Carnegie Stichting}}) is an organization based in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]. It was founded in 1903 by [[Andrew Carnegie]] in order to manage his donation of US$1.5 million, which was used for the construction, management and maintenance of the [[Peace Palace]]. The Peace Palace was built to house the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] and a library of international law.

The Foundation became the legal owner of the [[Peace Palace]] because the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]], which is based there along with its library, could not own the building under Dutch law.

The Foundation has five Dutch board members, of whom four are chosen by the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch monarch]] and one by the Supervisory Board of the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]]. The current chairman of the Carnegie Foundation is [[Hans van den Broek]].

Since 1931, the foundation has been entrusted with the annual awarding of the [[Wateler Peace Prize]].

The Carnegie Foundation is a member of the [[Hague Academic Coalition]]. This is a consortium of institutions in the fields of international relations, international law and international development, based in The Hague. The Carnegie Foundation is one of the founding partners of [[The Hague Institute for Global Justice]], a newly established research institute in [[The Hague]].
