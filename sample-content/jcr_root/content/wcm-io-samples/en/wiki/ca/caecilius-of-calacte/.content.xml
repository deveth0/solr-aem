&amp;apos;&amp;apos;For others of this name see [[Archagathus (disambiguation)]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Caecilius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of [[Calacte]] in [[Sicily]], Greek [[rhetoric]]ian, flourished at [[Rome]] during the reign of [[Augustus]].

Originally called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Archagathus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, he took the name of Caecilius from his patron, one of the Metelli. According to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Suda]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, he was of the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]]. Next to [[Dionysius Halicarnassensis|Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], he was the most important critic and rhetorician of the Augustan age.

Only fragments are extant of his numerous and important works, among which may be mentioned:
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;On the Style of the Ten Orators&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the lives and a critical examination of the works of the [[Ten Orators]]), the basis of the pseudo-[[Plutarch]]ian treatise of the same name, in which Caecilius is frequently referred to;
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;On the Sublime&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, attacked by (?) [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]] in his essay on the same subject;
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;History of the Servile Wars&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or slave risings in Sicily, the local interest of which would naturally appeal to the author;
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;On Rhetoric and Rhetorical Figures&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alphabetical Selection of Phrases&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, intended to serve as a guide to the acquirement of a pure Attic style—the first example of an Atticist lexicon, mentioned by Suidas in the preface to his lexicon as one of his authorities;
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Against the Phrygians&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, probably an attack on the florid style of the [[Asiatic school]] of rhetoric.
