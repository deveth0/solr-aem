&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cardonald&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-sco|Cardonal}},&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.scots-online.org/dictionary/read.asp?letter=C&amp;amp;CurPage=12 The Online Scots Dictionary]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; {{lang-gd|Cair Dhòmhnaill}})&amp;lt;ref name=railwaynames&amp;gt;[http://newsnetscotland.com/index.php/component/content/article/2999-list-of-railway-station-names.html List of railway station names in English, Scots and Gaelic – NewsNetScotland]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; is an outlying suburb of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] city of [[Glasgow]]. Formerly a village in its own right, it lies to the southwest of the city and is bounded to the south by the [[River Cart|White Cart Water]]. The area was part of [[Renfrewshire]] until 1926 when the villages of Cardonald, [[Crookston, Glasgow|Crookston]], [[Halfway, Glasgow|Halfway]] and their surrounding farmland were annexed to Glasgow.

In the 15th century the lands of Cardonald were the property of Johannes Norwald or Normanville, Dominus of Cardownalde. His granddaughter and heiress, Marion Stewart (daughter of Isabella Norwald of Cardonald and Sir William Stewart of Castlemilk), married Allan Stewart, establishing the line of Stewarts of Cardonald. The Cardonald Stewarts were a junior branch of the [[House of Stewart]]. Allan Stewart of Cardonald, the first Stewart of Cardonald, was the younger son of [[John Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox]]. The Cardonald Stewarts had their seat at the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Place of Cardonald&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also known as Cardonald Castle or Cardonald House), built in 1565. It was demolished and replaced by a farmhouse - Cardonald Place Farm - in 1848.

The line of the Stewarts of Cardonald ended with Allan&amp;apos;s great-grandson, James Stewart of Cardonald (1512–1584). He had served as a captain in the Scottish Guards of the [[King of France|Kings of France]], and is buried in [[Paisley Abbey]]. As he had no issue, the lands of Cardonald passed to his sister&amp;apos;s son, [[Walter Stewart, 1st Lord Blantyre]]. His family resided at the Place of Cardonald for generations, and retained lands in Cardonald until the 20th century.

In 1926, [[Glasgow_Corporation#City_Council|Glasgow Corporation]] bought the Cardonald estates, They gave opportunity to private development replicating [[Kelvindale]] [[cottage flat]]s By Western Heritable and Council housing in the area. Cardonald was divided into North and South Cardonald, with the south mostly composed of owner-occupied and privately rented cottage flats, whilst the north was made up of owner-occupied and rented accommodation owned by Glasgow Corporation, divided by the new [[Paisley]] Road West, including terraced houses, flats, and semi-detached property. In the 1950s, the Corporation erected the [[United Kingdom|UK&amp;apos;s]] first high-rise flats in the area. Although only 10 storeys high, and overlooking [[Crookston Castle]], the Moss Heights flats were the first of many high-rise blocks to be built in Glasgow.

[[Cardonald College]], one of Scotland&amp;apos;s largest [[further education]] colleges, opened in 1972, and rapidly expanded in recent times.

Cardonald has three churches: Cardonald Parish Church ([[Church of Scotland]]) (built 1889), Hillington Park ([[Church of Scotland]]) and [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] [[Catholic]] Church (built 1938).
The district is served by [[Cardonald railway station]] on the [[Inverclyde Line]] and by numerous bus routes. There is also easy access to the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8 motorway]] via Junction 25.
