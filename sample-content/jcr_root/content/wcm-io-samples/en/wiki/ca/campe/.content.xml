        text="&lt;p&gt;:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This article is about a mythological monster. To read about the lexicographer, please see [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

In [[Greek mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Campe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kampê&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-el|Κάμπη}} &amp;quot;crooked&amp;quot;; confer καμπή &amp;quot;a twist, a bend&amp;quot;) is the name of a [[chthonic]] female [[monster]] ([[drakaina (mythology)|drakaina]]).

==Mythology==
Campe was a [[dragon]] with a woman&amp;apos;s head and torso and a [[scorpion]]-like tail. [[Nonnus]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dionysiaca]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 18.23–264) gives the most elaborated description of her.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Ther/DrakainaKampe.html Theoi.com: Kampe, including translated section from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dionysiaca&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Joseph Eddy Fontenrose]] suggests that for Nonnus Campe is a Greek refiguring of [[Tiamat]] and that &amp;quot;she is [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]] under another name, as Nonnos indicates, calling her Echidnaean Enyo, identifying her snaky legs with Echidna&amp;apos;s&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;a female counterpart of his [[Typhon]]&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Fontenrose, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Python: A Study of Delphic Myth and Its Origins&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1974:243.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Campe was set by [[Cronus]] to guard the [[Hekatonkheires|Hecatonchires]] and [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]] in [[Tartarus]] after Cronus did not release them from their imprisonment there when they were imprisoned by [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]. She was killed by [[Zeus]] when he rescued the Cyclopes for help in the [[Titanomachy|battle with the Titans]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bibliotheke]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1.2.1.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In his lexicon [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] (K.614) noted that the poet [[Epicharmos]] had called Campe a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Cetus (mythology)|kētos]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or sea-monster.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Max Mayer &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Die Giganten und Titanen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1887:232–34.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Appearance==
Campe is generally depicted as being centaurine in form, her lower part being that of a dragon, with a scorpion&amp;apos;s tail, snakes around her ankles, 50 grizzly heads of various creatures (wolves, bears, lions...) bubbling around her waist. She also carried two scimitars, had snake hair, and possessed wings on her dragon back. More rare depictions describe her as holding a scythe, being serpentine from the waist down with a scorpion&amp;apos;s tail with snake hair and three animal heads around the waist with wings on her shoulders.{{fact|date=December 2012}}

==Popular culture==

===Television===
* In the TV series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Class of the Titans]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Campe (voiced by [[Pam Hyatt]] in Season One, [[Pauline Newstone]] in Season Two) is the jailer of Tartarus and her only escapee was Cronus. She has a woman&amp;apos;s head, torso and arms, the body of a snake and has a live scorpion on her back that can detach itself of her body, and she wields a staff. When she wanted to use the Chosen Ones as bait in order to recapture Cronus as seen in &amp;quot;Prisoner Campe&amp;quot;, she finally allied herself with them after an embarrassing fight against Jay. She had to choose between capturing Cronus and saving Herry&amp;apos;s life. Her favorite question to ask herself seems to be &amp;quot;Is my enemy&amp;apos;s enemy my friend or my enemy?&amp;quot;

===Modern literature===
* Campe (spelled &amp;quot;Kampê&amp;quot;) appears as a character in the fourth book in the [[Percy Jackson &amp;amp; the Olympians]] series, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Battle of the Labyrinth]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, where she is a member of the Titan Kronos&amp;apos; army of monsters.  She is first encountered serving as Briares&amp;apos; jailer on [[Alcatraz]]. Briares is a Hundred-Handed one, or [[Hekatonkheires|Hecatonchire]], the last one of his kind. She is described as half woman and half dragon. The dragon portion is twenty feet long with black scales, large claws, a barbed tail, and dragon legs made out of hundreds of viper snakes. The human portion had snakes for hair similar to [[Medusa]]. Where the human and dragon portions meet contained bubbly skin with the heads of various wild animals growing from each bubble. She also wields two poison-tipped [[scimitar]]s. She is killed by Briares, who threw rocks at her.
