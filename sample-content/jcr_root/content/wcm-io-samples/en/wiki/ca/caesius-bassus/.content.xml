&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Caesius Bassus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] lyric [[poet]], who lived in the reign of [[Nero]].

He was the intimate friend of [[Aulus Persius Flaccus|Persius]], who dedicated his sixth satire to him, and whose works be edited (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Schol. on Persius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, vi. I). He is said to have lost his life in the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] (79). He had a great reputation as a poet; [[Quintilian]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Instit.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; x. I. 96) goes so far as to say that, with the exception of [[Horace]], he was the only lyric poet worth reading.

He is also identified with the author of a treatise &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Metris&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of which considerable fragments, probably of an abbreviated edition, are extant (ed. Keil, 1885). The work was probably originally in verse, and afterwards recast or epitomized in [[prose]] form to be used as an instruction book. An account of some of the metres of Horace (in Keil, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grammatici Latini&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, vi. 305), bearing the title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ars Caesii Bassi de Metris&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is not by him, but chiefly borrowed by its unknown author, from the treatise, mentioned above.
