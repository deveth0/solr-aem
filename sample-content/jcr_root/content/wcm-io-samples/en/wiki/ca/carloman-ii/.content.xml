&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Carloman II&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (c. 866 &amp;amp;ndash; 12 December 884), [[king of France|King of Western Francia]], was the youngest son of King [[Louis the Stammerer]] and [[Ansgarde of Burgundy]], and became king, jointly with his brother [[Louis III of France]], on his father&amp;apos;s death in 879.

Some nobles advocated electing a sole king, but eventually both brothers were elected kings. Although doubts were cast upon their legitimacy, the brothers obtained recognition and in March 880 divided their father&amp;apos;s realm at [[Amiens]], Carloman receiving [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Aquitaine]].

However, Duke [[Boso of Provence|Boso]] had renounced his allegiance to both brothers and had been elected [[King of Burgundy|King of Provence]]. In the summer of 880 the brothers Carloman and [[Louis III of France|Louis]] marched against him, took [[Mâcon]] and the northern parts of Boso&amp;apos;s realm. They united their forces with those of [[Charles the Fat]] and unsuccessfully besieged [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] from August to November. Only in the summer of 882, Vienne was taken after being besieged by [[Richard, Duke of Burgundy|Richard]], Count of Autun.

About the same time, in August 882, Carloman became sole king owing to his brother&amp;apos;s death, but the kingdom was in a deplorable condition partly owing to incursions from the [[Normans|Norman]] raiders, and his power was very circumscribed. There were revolts of the feudal lords even in Burgundy.

Carloman met his death while hunting on 12 December 884 and was succeeded in the rule by his cousin, the Emperor [[Charles the Fat]].
