&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Casselman&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] in eastern [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], in the [[Prescott and Russell County, Ontario|United Counties of Prescott and Russell]] on the [[South Nation River]].

It is a village on the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] [[Ontario Provincial Highway 417|417]] between [[Ottawa]] and [[Montreal]] at the crossroads of Regional Road 7, about 55&amp;amp;nbsp;km southeast of downtown Ottawa. [[Highway 138 (Ontario)|Highway 138]] to Cornwall and the USA is minutes away. It is served by a [[Casselman railway station|station]] on the Montreal-Ottawa [[Via Rail]] train, twice a day in each direction.  It is also served by [[Greyhound Canada]] on the Montreal-Ottawa route, four times a day in each direction.

Casselman is surrounded on all sides by [[The Nation, Ontario|The Nation]], since Casselman citizens refused to join the fusion of municipalities.

The village was named after Martin Casselman who built a sawmill near the site of the current town in 1844.  The village installed modern water and sewer services that became operational in 1977.

Casselman hosted [http://echodunpeuple.ca/index.php &amp;apos;&amp;apos;L&amp;apos;écho d&amp;apos;un peuple&amp;apos;&amp;apos;], at Ferme Drouin, one of the biggest shows ever presented in Ontario until the organization ran into financial trouble in 2008.
