&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Castlethorpe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] with a population of about 1000 in the [[Milton Keynes (borough)|Borough of Milton Keynes]] ([[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Buckinghamshire]]), England.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.milton-keynes.gov.uk/parishes/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=17026 Parishes in Milton Keynes] - Milton Keynes Council.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is about {{convert|3|mi|km|1}} north-east of [[Stony Stratford]], {{convert|4|mi|km|1}} north-west of [[Newport Pagnell]] and {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} north of [[Central Milton Keynes]]. It is separated from the county of [[Northamptonshire]] by the [[River Tove]].

==History==

The village is relatively more recent than those around it, and it started out in life as a castle belonging to the [[lord of the manor]] of nearby [[Hanslope]]. A settlement of [[servant (domestic)|servant]]s and manual workers grew up around the castle and this became the village of Castlethorpe (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;thorpe&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[Old Norse]] language (particularly Danish) word for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;homestead&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and it is not unreasonable to assume that there may well have been a Danish settlement nearby as the area was, if not part of, certainly close to, the [[Danelaw]]). The castle was damaged in 1215 in a feud between [[Foulkes de Brent]], who had been sent by King John ([[John of England]]), and [[William Mauduit]], the castle&amp;apos;s owner. Mauduit was reputedly in rebellion against the King.  Although Mauduit returned to claim his seat after the King&amp;apos;s death, the castle was demolished shortly afterward. All that is left today are the grassy mounds of the former [[Motte and bailey|Motte-and-Bailey castle]].

==Parish==
The [[parish church]] is dedicated to [[Simon the Canaanite|St Simon]] and [[St Jude]], and dates back to [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] times, though the present church is of mainly [[Norman architecture|Norman]] design.  Castlethorpe has grown up around the church and some traditional old stone [[cottage]]s at the centre of the village which is currently designated a [[conservation area]]. It is the centre of a [[Civil Parish]].

==Rail and canal==
The [[West Coast Main Line]] runs alonside the west side of Castlethorpe, and the village had its [[Castlethorpe railway station|own railway station]] until September 1964 when, to the outrage of the village, it was closed down.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.mkheritage.co.uk/cv/docs/railway/closure.html Castlethorpe Station Closure - 6 September 1964] - Milton Keynes Heritage Association&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The [[Grand Union Canal]] also runs by on the outskirts of the village, and it is a short walk along the towpath to the neighbouring village of [[Cosgrove, Northamptonshire|Cosgrove]].
