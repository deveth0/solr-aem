        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Carlo Antonio Campioni&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (November 16, 1720 – April 12, 1788), also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Carlo Antonio Campione&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Charles Antoine Campion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was an Italian [[composer]], as well as a collector of early music.

Campioni was born in [[Lunéville]] in [[France]]. Not much is known about his education in music. Anton Raaff believes Campioni studied violin with [[Giuseppe Tartini]] in Padua.

From 1763 until his death, he was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;maestro di cappella&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to the Grand Duke of [[Florence, Italy|Florence]]. He died in Florence.

He wrote music in a variety of forms, but was particularly prolific in instrumental music, publishing several sets of [[trio sonata]]s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Chamber Music By John H. Baron p. 296 Routledge, 2002&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; A setting of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Salve regina&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  is his only published work of sacred music, though he did write more sacred works, such as Requiems for Franz I and Maria Theresa, and a Te Deum celebrating the birth of Francis II.

The music of Campioni circulated in Europe in many different editions and combinations. To this day, a catalogue of Campioni&amp;apos;s music put together by at-the-time Ambassador [[Thomas Jefferson]] is useful to musicologists in studying Campioni&amp;apos;s oeuvre.
