[[File:Carl Zeidler.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Gravesite [[cenotaph]] in Forest Home Cemetery]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Carl Frederick Zeidler&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (January 4, 1908 &amp;amp;ndash; December 11, 1942) was the [[List of mayors of Milwaukee|mayor]] of the city of [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], from 1940 to 1942.

Born in Milwaukee, he graduated from [[Marquette University]] in 1929 and receiving a J.D. in 1931.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;amp;term_id=2143&amp;amp;keyword=zeidler&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Serving as an assistant city attorney for Milwaukee (1936â€“1940), Zeidler stunned the city when he upset six-term [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] mayor [[Daniel Hoan]] to become mayor of Milwaukee in 1940. Hoan had served as mayor for the past 24 years.

His rise to power was orchestrated by young writers [[Robert Bloch]] (later the author of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and [[Harold Gauer]], who created elaborate campaign shows. In Bloch&amp;apos;s autobiography, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Once Around the Bloch]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, he gives an inside account of the campaign, and the innovations he and Gauer came up with... for instance, the original &amp;quot;releasing-balloons-from-the-ceiling&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;shtick&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He comments bitterly on how, after Zeidler&amp;apos;s election, they were ignored and not even paid their promised salaries, while credit was taken by local establishment figures like [[Milton Rice Polland]] instead.

He ends the account with a philosophical point:

:&amp;quot;If Carl Zeidler had not asked Jim Doolittle to manage his campaign, Doolittle would never have contacted me about it. And the only reason Doolittle knew me to begin with was because he read my yarn (&amp;quot;The Cloak&amp;quot;) in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

:Rattling this chain of circumstances, one may stretch it a bit further. If I had not written a little vampire story called &amp;quot;The Cloak&amp;quot;, Carl Zeidler might never have become mayor of Milwaukee.&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Bloch, Robert. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorized Autobiography&amp;apos;&amp;apos; New York: Tor Books, 1993&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Zeidler was attracting some attention on the national political scene{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} when [[World War II]] broke out. He believed that he could best help the war effort by enlisting; he resigned his position as mayor and accepted a [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] [[commissioned officer|commission]] on April 8, 1942. He asked for the most dangerous job on ship and became officer in charge of a gun battery on board the [[United States Merchant Marine|merchant ship]] [[SS La Salle|SS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;La Salle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]]. The ship and all hands were reported missing off the coast of [[South Africa]] on December 11, 1942. He was officially presumed dead November 7, 1944. A gravestone cenotaph marks his plot at [[Forest Home Cemetery]] in Milwaukee.

Carl&amp;apos;s brother, Socialist [[Frank P. Zeidler]] later became mayor of Milwaukee from 1948 to 1960.

Carl Zeidler was known as the &amp;quot;Singing Mayor of Milwaukee&amp;quot; because wherever he went he always had a song for every meeting or occasion, especially &amp;quot;[[God Bless America]]&amp;quot;; he was also called the &amp;quot;Boy Mayor&amp;quot; because of his boyish good looks.
