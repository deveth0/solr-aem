&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Category killer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a term used in [[marketing]] and [[strategic management]] to describe a [[product (business)|product]], [[Service (economics)|service]], [[brand]], or [[company]] that has such a distinct sustainable [[competitive advantage]] that [[competition|competing firms]] find it almost impossible to operate profitably in that industry (or in the same local area). {{citation needed|date=July 2011}} The existence of a category killer eliminates almost all market entities, whether real or virtual. Many existing firms leave the industry, thereby increasing the industry&amp;apos;s [[concentration ratio]].

The definition most often associated with the term is a [[big-box]] [[retail chain]] (such as [[Home Depot]], [[Best Buy]] or [[Toys &amp;quot;R&amp;quot; Us]]) that is focused on one or few categories of merchandise and offers a wide selection of merchandise in these categories at relatively low prices. The emergence of such stores has taken a toll on specialised local stores in the same market (such as toys), but also affected many larger [[department store]]s.

An example of a category killer business is [[eBay]]. The online auction site has a near-[[monopoly]] because buyers and sellers naturally gravitate to the largest, most liquid market. As a result, the site has almost no competition and has forced similar auction sites (like those run by [[Yahoo!]]) into a very small portion of the market.  Jupiter Communications has estimated that eBay earned 90% of all revenues in the consumer-to-consumer auction market in the year 2000.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news
