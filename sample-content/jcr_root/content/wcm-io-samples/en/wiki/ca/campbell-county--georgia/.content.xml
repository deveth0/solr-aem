&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Campbell County, Georgia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[county (United States)|county]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] from 1828 to 1931.  It was created by the state [[Georgia General Assembly|legislature]] on December 20, 1828 from land taken from [[Fayette County, Georgia|Fayette]], [[Coweta County, Georgia|Coweta]], and [[Carroll County, Georgia|Carroll]] counties, and from the half of [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]] which became [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] soon afterward.  Georgia&amp;apos;s [[Georgia Land Lotteries|Cherokee Land Lottery]] of 1832 also added to the county. The county was named for Duncan G. Campbell, one of the U.S. commissioners responsible for the [[Treaty of Indian Springs]].&amp;lt;ref name=DigitalLibraryOfGeorgia&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Campbell County|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/histcountymaps/campbellhistmaps.htm|publisher=Digital Library of Georgia|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The original county seat was [[Campbellton, Georgia|Campbellton]]; however, when the [[Atlanta &amp;amp; West Point Railroad]] began to plan its route, the town&amp;apos;s residents said no due to [[noise (environmental)|noise]] concerns.  The [[rail tracks|tracks]] were laid through [[Fairburn, Georgia|Fairburn]] instead, which flourished while Campbellton died out, and Fairburn soon became the new [[county seat]] in 1870. The [[Campbell County Courthouse (Fairburn, Georgia)|Campbell County Courthouse]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The northwestern half of Campbell (and a bit more of Carroll) became [[Douglas County, Georgia|Douglas]] County in 1870, divided on  October 17 at the [[Chattahoochee River]].  The remainder of Campbell County was ceded to Fulton County at the end of 1931, along with [[Milton County, Georgia|Milton County]], to save money.  The [[legislation]] creating the merger was enacted on August 9, 1929, with Milton being added to the process in 1931.
