        text="&lt;p&gt;During the [[1948 Palestine war|1948 war]], on February 29 and again on March 31, the military coaches of the [[Cairo]]-[[Haifa]] train were mined by the Jewish militant group [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]].

On February 29, the Lehi mined the train north of [[Rehovot]], killing 28 British soldiers and wounding 35. No civilians were hurt. One or more bombs laid on the track were detonated from a nearby orange grove. Lehi took credit for the bombing of the British train as revenge for the [[Ben Yehuda Street Bombing]] in Jerusalem. The train was the normal daily passenger express to which four military coaches had been attached.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Times&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1 March 1948.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book | author = Zev Golan | title = Stern The Man and his Gang | publisher = Yair Publishing | year = 2011 | page = 249}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On March 31, the train was mined again near Binyamina, a Jewish settlement in the neighborhood of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]], killing 40 persons and wounding 60. The casualties were all civilians, mostly Arabs. Although there were some soldiers on the train, none were injured. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Palestine Post&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;New York Times&amp;apos;&amp;apos; attributed the attack to Lehi.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Palestine Post&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1 April 1948&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;New York Times&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1 April 1948&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
