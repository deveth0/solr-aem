&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Carl Ritter von Ghega&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Karl von Ghega&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (10 January 1802 – 14 March 1860) was the designer of the [[Semmering Railway]] from [[Gloggnitz]] to [[Mürzzuschlag]].

Born in [[Venice]] as Carlo Ghega in an [[Albanians|Albanian]] family, he studied in [[Padua]], where he took the examination for doctor of mathematics at the age of 18. He began his [[engineering]] career with [[road]] and [[hydraulic engineering]] in [[Venice]]. Among other things he contributed to the building of the road over [[Cortina d&amp;apos;Ampezzo]] to [[Toblach]]. From 1836 to 1840 he was a construction supervisor for the [[railway]] track from [[Brno]] to [[Břeclav]], the so-called [[Emperor Ferdinand North Railway]]. During this time, in 1836 and 37 he studied also the railways in England and other [[Europe]]an countries. In 1842, entrusted with the entire planning of the future state railway, he made a study trip to [[North America]].

After his return to the state railway he began with the planning of the railway line to the south, from Mürzzuschlag to [[Graz]] and [[Trieste]]. The crossing of the [[Semmering]] was not believed possible, but as early as 1844 he submitted a plan for the crossing of the Semmering, with locomotives without an extra rail for gear wheels. Before the building was fully decided, he began to enforce the construction of [[locomotive]]s which could overcome such upward gradients. Construction of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Semmeringbahn&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was begun in 1848, and in 1851, before its completion in 1854, he became a [[knight]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ritter]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

Carl von Ghega was next assigned to the building of a railway in [[Transylvania]], but he could not see this project to its end because of his death in [[Vienna]] from [[tuberculosis]].
