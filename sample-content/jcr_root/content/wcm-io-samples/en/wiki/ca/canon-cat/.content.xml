[[Image:Canon Cat.jpg|thumb|Photo of the Canon Cat.]]
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Canon Cat&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a task-dedicated, desktop [[microcomputer|computer]] released by [[Canon Inc.]] in 1987 at a price of $1495 [[United States dollar|USD]]. On the surface it was not unlike the dedicated [[word processor]]s popular in the late 1970s to early 1980s, but it was far more powerful and incorporated many unique ideas for data manipulation.

==Description==
The Cat was primarily the brainchild of [[Jef Raskin]], originator of the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] project at [[Apple Computer|Apple]] in 1979. It featured a [[text user interface]], not making use of any [[computer mouse|mouse]], [[icon (computing)|icon]]s, or [[computer graphics|graphics]]. All data was seen as a long &amp;quot;stream&amp;quot; of text broken into several pages. Instead of using a traditional [[command line interface]] or [[menu (computing)|menu]] system, the Cat made use of its special [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], with commands being activated by holding down a &amp;quot;Use Front&amp;quot; key and pressing another key. The Cat also used special &amp;quot;Leap keys&amp;quot; which, when held down, allowed the user to [[incremental find|incrementally search]] for [[string (computer science)|string]]s of characters.

The machine&amp;apos;s hardware consisted of a 9 inch (229 mm) black-and-white [[computer display|monitor]], a single 3Â½ inch 256 [[kilobyte|KB]] [[floppy disk]] drive and an [[IBM Selectric typewriter|IBM Selectric]]-compatible [[computer keyboard|keyboard]]. It used a [[Motorola 68000]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] (like the Macintosh, Lisa and Amiga) running at 5 [[Megahertz|MHz]], had 256 KB of [[random-access memory|RAM]], and an internal 300/1200 bit/s [[modem]]. Setup and user preference data was stored in 8 KB of non-volatile (battery backed-up) RAM. The Cat&amp;apos;s array of [[input/output|I/O]] interfaces encompassed one [[Centronics]] [[parallel port]], one [[RS-232|RS-232C]] [[serial port]] ([[DB-25]]), and two [[RJ11, RJ14, RJ25|RJ11]] telephone jacks for the modem loop. The total weight of the system was 17 pounds (7.7 kg).

An extensive range of application software was built into 256 KB of [[read-only memory|ROM]]: standard [[office suite]] programs, communications, a 90,000 word spelling dictionary, and user programming toolchains for [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] and [[assembly language]].

Often considered a text-only machine, the Cat included graphics routines in ROM as well as connectors for a [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] or other [[pointing device]] that were never used. [http://www.apple-history.com/?page=gui_raskin2]

There is a current software project underway, that was initiated by the late [[Jef Raskin]] himself, to develop a similar yet even more capable system for today&amp;apos;s computing systems. The project (called [[Archy]]) is designed to eventually replace current software [[User interface|interfaces]].
