==Biography==
She was born in [[Boston]] in 1838 to Hepzibah and Nathanial Hall.

She played a key role in assuring that women would be on an equal footing with men from the first inception of the [[Grange movement]]. She felt that the family farm included the women, and then so should the organization that the family would join. Seeing through her rural teachings that the woman was usually isolated on the farm, the Grange would offer an opportunity for women to expand their talents. She became [[Oliver Hudson Kelley]]&amp;apos;s assistant, and was also his niece. It was with her attention to detail and correspondence that Kelley&amp;apos;s dream became a reality in organizing the Grange. The National Grange later dignified her contributions to the Order by recognizing her as an equal with the original seven founders.&amp;lt;ref name=bio/&amp;gt;

She eventually inherited a valuable farm from a brother, near [[Knapp, Dunn County, Wisconsin|Knapp, Wisconsin]] and lived there for many years. Failing health caused her to move to an apartment in [[Minneapolis]]. Here she was residing when she took an automobile trip on October 11, 1918. She was involved in an accident near [[French Lick, Indiana]] from which she never recovered, and her death occurred at the age of 80 on December 11, 1918.&amp;lt;ref name=bio/&amp;gt;

She was interred at Minneapolis in Lake Wood Cemetery. A friend said of her, “She just lived being sweet and lovely to everyone.”&amp;lt;ref name=bio/&amp;gt;

==Legacy==
The original seven founders of the Grange were: [[Oliver Hudson Kelley]], [[William Saunders (botanist)|William Saunders]], [[Francis Marion McDowell|Francis M. McDowell]], [[John Trimble]], [[Aaron B. Grosh]], [[John R. Thompson]] and [[William M. Ireland]].
