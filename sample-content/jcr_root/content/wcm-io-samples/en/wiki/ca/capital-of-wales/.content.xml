The current &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;capital of Wales&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is [[Cardiff]], which was first referred to as such in 1955, when [[Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby|Gwilym Lloyd-George]], then Minister for Welsh Affairs commented in a Parliamentary written answer that &amp;quot;no formal measures are necessary to give effect to this decision&amp;quot;. Since 1999, Cardiff has been the location of the [[National Assembly for Wales]].

In the past, other places have been regarded as the Welsh capital, including
*[[Strata Florida]], the [[Cistercian]] [[abbey]] where [[Llywelyn the Great]] held council in 1238.
*[[Machynlleth]], where [[Owain GlyndÅµr]] held a parliament in 1404.
*[[Ludlow]], England, seat of the [[Council of Wales and the Marches]] from 1473 to 1689.

The [[ecclesiastical]] capital of Wales is [[St David&amp;apos;s]], the birthplace of the country&amp;apos;s patron saint, [[Saint David|David]].

The [[National Library of Wales]] is located in none of these, instead being sited in [[Aberystwyth]].
