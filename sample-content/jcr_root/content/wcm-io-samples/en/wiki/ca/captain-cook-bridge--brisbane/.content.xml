The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Captain Cook Bridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a motorway bridge over the [[Brisbane River]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]. It was built exclusively for vehicular traffic and was opened in 1972. The bridge crosses at the South Brisbane Reach of the river, linking [[Gardens Point, Brisbane|Gardens Point]] to Kangaroo Point .

Captain Cook Bridge actually consists of two separate bridges, one for each direction of traffic.  The bridge carries four lanes of traffic in either direction and links the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;M3&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Pacific Motorway (Ewingsdaleâ€“Brisbane)|Pacific Motorway]] to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;M3&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Riverside Expressway]]. It is the main route from the city&amp;apos;s south into the [[Brisbane central business district]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ccbtfi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/captain-cook-bridge-to-face-inspection/2007/08/17/1186857719587.html |title=Captain Cook Bridge to face inspection |accessdate=9 September 2011 |date=17 August 2007 |work=Brisbane Times }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

At the time of completion the main span of 183 m held the world record for this type of structure for a period of 3 months, when it was superseded by the Harama Bridge in [[Japan]] (241&amp;amp;nbsp;m).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;xx&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news |title=Captain Cook Bridge |publisher=Structurae |url= http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0004721 |accessdate=2009-12-15}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The structure is [[Queensland]]&amp;apos;s busiest traffic bridge with more than 1 million vehicles crossing it weekly in 2007.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,22258655-952,00.html |title=Captain Cook Bridge riddled with holes |date=17 August 2007 |author=Tuck Thompson |accessdate=2008-06-29 |work=The Courer Mail }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Downstream from the Captain Cook Bridge is the [[Story Bridge, Brisbane|Story Bridge]], while the [[Goodwill Bridge, Brisbane|Goodwill Bridge]] is the next crossing upstream.

Concerns were raised in 2007 about the structure&amp;apos;s integrity after it was revealed that contractors who attached a gantry to the bridge had drilled numerous holes which had damaged steel reinforcement bars.  After investigations were completed it was concluded that the damage was insignificant as only 57&amp;amp;nbsp;vertical steel bars out of 21000 had been cut.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/riverside-expressway-bridge-structurally-safe/2008/08/04/1217701934235.html |title=Riverside Expressway bridge &amp;apos;structurally safe&amp;apos; |accessdate=15 December 2009 |date=4 August 2008 |work=[[Brisbane Times]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Digital]] }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
