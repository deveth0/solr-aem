A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;carrel desk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small [[desk]] (usually) featuring high sides meant to visually isolate its user from any surroundings either partially or totally.  They were a predecessor to the more recent [[cubicle desk]].

== Description ==
Carrel desks are most often found in [[university]] or [[college]] [[library|libraries]]. Most carrel desks are rectangular in shape. Above the main desktop area there is often a shelf for books. Sometimes the seat is integrated with the carrel desk. Unlike the [[cubicle desk]], carrel desks usually have no file drawers or other facilities. Since the late 1990s, some carrel desk designs provide [[AC power plugs and sockets|AC power]] and [[Ethernet]] receptacles for students using [[laptop computer]]s.

Like the [[school desk]], the carrel desk is normally produced and sold in large quantities for an institutional market. They are made to stand alone or to be grouped together, with or without common sides or walls.

The word carrel can also refer to a small isolated &amp;quot;study room&amp;quot; in [[public library|public libraries]] and on university campuses; usually the room has a lockable door to which the user is granted the key on request. Carrels usually contain a desk (not necessarily one described as above), shelving and a [[lamp]]. Carrels are generally quite popular at universities and are therefore usually quickly occupied. This becomes especially true during mid-term examinations and [[final exam|finals]]. They have the advantage of power for a laptop (and often internet port) as well as generally being quieter than in the main library building. Carrels are also often used as temporary storage for books and materials the user is not finished with while they are at lectures or labs.

Carrels originated in [[monastery|monasteries]] to help contain the cacophony of roomfuls of [[monk]]s reading aloud, as was the early practice.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Dom Le Clerq, Love of Learning and the Desire for God, trans. Catherine Misrahi (New York: Fordham University Press, 1961) p. 18&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
