        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cabinet-style Council&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a type of [[local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] which has been introduced in the [[United Kingdom]] for Local [[City Council|Councils]] following the introduction of the [[Local Government Act 2000]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/22/contents Act in full at National Archive] Accessed: 2 February 2011&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

It consists of the Leader and the Cabinet itself, which is usually formed by the majority party in the [[local authority]]. Each member of the Cabinet holds a separate portfolio, such as Culture, Economic Development, Education, etc. Also included are Committees, such as a Standards Committee, as well as a Scrutiny Committee.

The Leader and Cabinet are responsible for policies, plans and strategies, and for recommending them to the overall Council, which is of course convened as a whole, at regular council meetings. Ordinary Committees take decisions within the policies, etc., that have been approved by the Council. The Standards Committee ensures the standards of conduct are set and adhered to and the [[Overview and Scrutiny]] Committee holds the Cabinet to account for its decisions and is responsible that the [[democratic]] [[checks and balances]] are maintained.
