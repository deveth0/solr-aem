        text="&lt;p&gt;In [[Greek mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Canace&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Lang-el|Κανάκη}}) was a daughter of [[Aeolus]] and [[Enarete]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Hesiod]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Catalogue of Women]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; fr. 10(a) Pap. Turner, fr. 1-3, col. I-II, 25-75&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and lover of [[Poseidon]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Callimachus]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hymn to Demeter&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 99: Triopas mentions Canace as his mother by Poseidon&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Her brothers were [[Athamas]], [[Cretheus]], [[Deioneus]], [[Magnes (mythology)|Magnes]], [[Perieres]], [[Salmoneus]] and [[Sisyphus]].  Her sisters were [[Alcyone]], [[Arne (mythology)|Arne]], [[Calyce (mythology)|Calyce]], [[Peisidice]], [[Perimede (mythology)|Perimede]] and Tanagra. With Poseidon, she was the mother of [[Aloeus]], [[Epopeus]], Hopleus, Nireus and [[Triopas]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bibliotheca&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1. 7. 3 - 4&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In another, more famous version Canace was a lover not of Poseidon, but of her own brother [[Macareus (son of Aeolus)|Macareus]]. This tradition made them children of a different Aeolus, the lord of the winds (or the [[Tyrrhenia]]n king),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;These two are barely distinct in any case; see the article on Aeolus for discussion&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and his wife [[Amphithea]]. Canace fell in love with Macareus and committed incest with him, which resulted in her getting pregnant. Macareus promised to marry Canace but never did. When their child was born, Canace&amp;apos;s nurse tried to take the baby out of the palace in a basket, pretending to be carrying a sacrificial offering, but the baby cried out and revealed itself. Aeolus was outraged and compelled Canace to commit [[suicide]] as punishment, sending her a sword with which she was to stab herself. He also exposed the newborn child to its death. This story was told by [[Latin]] poet [[Ovid]] in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Heroides]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a selection of eighteen story-poems that pretend to be letters from mythological women to their lovers and ex-lovers.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ovid, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Heroides&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 11&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The story is also briefly referred to by Hyginus&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Hyginus]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fabulae&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 238 (Aeolus kills Canace), 242 (Macareus kills himself after Canace&amp;apos;s death), 243 (Canace kills herself over her forbidden love for Macareus)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and retold by [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], in whose account Macareus kills himself over the matter as well.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Pseudo-Plutarch, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Greek and Roman parallel Stories&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 28&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was also the subject of [[Euripides]]&amp;apos; lost play &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aeolus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, on which the extant versions appear to be based.

Her story was also put to the stage in the verse tragedy &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Canace (play)|Canace]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1588), by [[Italy|Italian]] playwright [[Sperone Speroni]], as well as being the subject of a tale in [[John Gower|Gower&amp;apos;s]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Confessio Amantis]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
