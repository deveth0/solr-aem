&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Caspar Bartholin the Younger&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Caspar Bartholin Secundus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; 10 September 1655 in [[Copenhagen]] – 11 June 1738), was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[anatomist]] who first described the &amp;quot;[[Bartholin&amp;apos;s gland]]&amp;quot; in the 17th century.

He came from an eminent family. He is the grandson of [[theology|theologian]] and [[anatomist]] [[Caspar Bartholin the Elder|Caspar Bartholin]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;the Elder&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and son of [[Thomas Bartholin]]. His uncle was [[Rasmus Bartholin]] and his brother, a historian, was called Thomas like his father.

The discovery of the Bartholin&amp;apos;s gland is sometimes mistakenly credited to his grandfather.

Caspar Bartholin the Younger started his medical studies in 1671 at the age of 16. When he was 19 he was appointed as professor of philosophy. He described the glands that bear his name in [[1677 in science|1677]].

In about 1696, Danish-born French [[anatomist]] [[Jacob B. Winslow|Jacob B. Winsløw]] was Bartholin&amp;apos;s [[prosector]].
