The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cabot Trail&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a highway and scenic roadway in the  [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Nova Scotia]].

It is located in northern [[Victoria County, Nova Scotia|Victoria County]] and [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness County]] on [[Cape Breton Island]].

The route measures {{convert|298|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length and completes a loop around the northern tip of the island, passing along and through the scenic [[Cape Breton Highlands]]. It is named after the explorer [[John Cabot]] who landed in Atlantic Canada in 1497, although most historians agree his landfall likely took place in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and not Cape Breton Island. (Premier [[Angus L. MacDonald]] attempted to re-brand Nova Scotia for tourism purposes as primarily Scottish and, as part of this effort, created both the names Cape Breton Highlands and Cabot Trail.)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ian MacKay. In the Province of History. McGill-Queen&amp;apos;s Press. 2010. &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Construction of the initial route was completed in 1932.

The northern section of the Cabot Trail passes through [[Cape Breton Highlands National Park]]. The western and eastern sections follow the rugged coastline, providing spectacular views of the ocean. The southwestern section passes through the [[Margaree River]] valley before passing along [[Bras d&amp;apos;Or Lake]].

The Cabot Trail is the only trunk secondary highway in Nova Scotia which does not have a signed route designation.  Road signs along the route instead have a unique mountain logo.

The road is internally referred to by the Department of Transportation and Public Works as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Trunk 30&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The Trunk 30 road named the &amp;quot;Cabot Trail&amp;quot; loops from Exit 7 on [[Nova Scotia Highway 105]] at [[Buckwheat Corner, Nova Scotia|Buckwheat Corner]] to Exit 11 on Highway 105 at [[South Haven, Nova Scotia|South Haven]].  The scenic travelway known as the &amp;quot;Cabot Trail&amp;quot; includes all of Trunk 30, as well as the portion of Highway 105 between exits 7 and 11.

The entire route is open year-round.
