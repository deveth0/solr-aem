The first caesium clock was built by [[Louis Essen]] in 1955 at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] in the UK.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

Caesium clocks are the most accurate commercially produced time and frequency standards, and serve as the [[primary standard]] for the definition of the [[second]] in [[SI]] (the metric system). By definition, radiation produced by the transition between the two hyperfine ground states of caesium (in the absence of external influences such as the Earth&amp;apos;s magnetic field) has a frequency of exactly 9,192,631,770 [[Hertz|Hz]].  That value was chosen so that the caesium second equalled, to the limit of human measuring ability in 1960 when it was adopted, the existing standard [[ephemeris second]] based on the [[Earth]]&amp;apos;s orbit around the [[Sun]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.1.105}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Because no other measurement involving time had been as precise, the effect of the change was less than the experimental uncertainty of all existing measurements.
