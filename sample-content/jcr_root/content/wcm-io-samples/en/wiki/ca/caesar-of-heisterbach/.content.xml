        text="&lt;p&gt;[[Image:Caesariusdenkmal Dollendorf.jpg|thumb|Statue of Caesarius made by Ernemann Sander in [[Königswinter]]-Oberdollendorf]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Caesarius of Heisterbach&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ca. 1180 – ca. 1240) (sometimes erroneously called in English &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Caesar of Heisterbach&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was the [[prior]] of the former [[Cistercian]] monastedry [[Heisterbach Abbey]], in the [[Siebengebirge]] near the little town of [[Oberdollendorf]], Germany.

He is best known as the compiler of a book of [[hagiography]], the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dialogus miraculorum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which is a collection of 746 [[miracle]] stories arranged in 12 &amp;quot;distinctions.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Strange|first=Joseph|title=Cæsarii Heisterbacensis Dialogus Miraculorum|year=1851|publisher=J.M. Heberle / H. Lempertz and co.|location=Cologne}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The tales are told in the form of dialogues between a monk and a novice. The work was often referred to by preachers seeking material for [[Sermon (oration)|sermon]]s in the [[Late Middle Ages]]. The work was popular and was widely distributed, showing that it catered well to the tastes of the times; it was perhaps the second largest late mediaeval best-seller, second only to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Golden Legend]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of [[Jacobus de Voragine]].  A vision reported in the book provided the source for the [[iconography]] of the [[Virgin of Mercy]].

Caesarius of Heisterbach is also remembered for a maxim on the rise and fall of monasteries: he wrote that discipline causes prosperity in a monastery, and prosperity undermines discipline.  He also gave the name of [[Titivillus]] as the [[demon]] who allegedly caused [[typographical error]]s in the work of scribes. He is further known as having attributed a famous statement to [[Arnaud Amalric]], a leader in the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. Upon being asked how to distinguish [[Cathars]] from [[Catholics]] at the besieged town of Béziers, Arnaud replied &amp;quot;Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://gahom.ehess.fr/relex/dialogusmiraculorum1/CdH-Dialog.mir.-Vol1/CdH-Dialog.mir.-Volume1-308.html |title=Dialogus Miraculorum |work=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Berlioz|first=Jacques|title=&amp;quot;Tuez-les tous, Dieu reconnaîtra les siens&amp;quot; - La croisade contre les Albigeois vue par Césaire de Heisterbach|year=1994|publisher=Éditions Loubatières|location=Portet-sur-Garonne}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; or &amp;quot;Slay them. God knows his own.&amp;quot; This statement is often remembered as &amp;quot;Kill them all and let God sort them out.&amp;quot;

The abbey was dissolved in 1803, when the library and archives were given to the city of [[Düsseldorf]]; the monastery and the church were sold and demolished in 1809. Though only the ruined [[apse]] with fragments of the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] remained, in 1897 a monument was erected nearby in his honour.
