&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gilles de Binche (called Binchois)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gilles de Bins&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ca. 1400 â€“ 20 September 1460), was a [[Franco-Flemish School|Franco-Flemish]] composer, one of the earliest members of the [[Burgundian School]], and one of the three most famous composers of the early 15th century. While often ranked behind his contemporaries [[Guillaume Dufay]] and [[John Dunstaple]], at least by contemporary scholars, his influence was arguably greater than either, since his works were cited, borrowed and used as source material more often than those by any other composer of the time.

==Life==
[[File:Jan van Eyck 092.jpg|thumb|[[Portrait of a Man (van Eyck, London)|&amp;quot;Timotheus&amp;quot;]] by van Eyck. According to [[Irwin Panofsky]] it is Gilles Binchois&amp;apos; portrait]]
Binchois was probably from [[Mons]], the son of Jean and Johanna de Binche, who may have been from the nearby town of [[Binche]]. His father was a councillor to Duke Guillaume IV of Hainault, and also had a position in a church in Mons. Nothing is known about Gilles until 1419, when he became organist at the church of Ste. Waudru in Mons. In 1423 went to live in [[Lille]]. Around this time he may have been a soldier in the service of the Burgundians, or perhaps the English [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Earl of Suffolk]], as indicated by a line in the memorial motet written on his death by [[Johannes Ockeghem|Ockeghem]].

Sometime near the end of the 1420s he joined the court chapel of Burgundy, and by the time of his motet &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nove cantum melodie&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1432) he was evidently a singer there, since the text of the motet itself lists all 19 singers.

He retired to [[Soignies]], evidently with a substantial pension for his long years of excellent service to the Burgundian court.

==Music and influence==
Binchois is often considered to be the finest melodist of the 15th century, writing carefully shaped lines which are easy to sing, and utterly memorable. His tunes appeared in copies decades after his death, and were often used as sources for [[Mass (music)|mass]] composition by later composers. Most of his music, even his sacred music, is simple and clear in outline, sometimes even ascetic; a greater contrast between Binchois and the extreme complexity of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[ars subtilior]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the previous century would be hard to imagine. Most of his secular songs are [[Rondeau (music)|rondeaux]], which became the most common song form during the century. Binchois, however, rarely wrote in [[strophic form]], but instead shaped his melody independently of the verse&amp;apos;s rhyme scheme.

Binchois wrote music for the court, secular songs of love and [[chivalry]], music that was expected by the Dukes of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and that was evidently loved by them.
