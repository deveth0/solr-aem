A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;gingerbread man&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[biscuit]] or [[cookie]] made of [[gingerbread]], usually in the shape of a stylized human, although making other shapes, especially seasonal themes (Christmas, Halloween, Easter, etc.) and characters, are quite common as well.

==History==
Gingerbread dates back to the 15th century, and figural biscuit-making was practiced in the 16th century.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;300 Years of Kitchen Collectibles&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Linda Campbell Franklin, 4th edition [Books Americana: New York] 1998 (p. 183)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The first documented instance of figure-shaped gingerbread-biscuits appearing was in the court of [[Elizabeth I of England]]. She had the gingerbread figures made and presented in the likeness of some of her important guests.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ref1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fergusonplarre.com.au/History/Gingerbread-Men.html|title=A History of Gingerbread Men|publisher=Ferguson Plarre Bakehouses|accessdate=2009-11-13}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Gingerbread landscape.jpg|thumb|Gingerbread man and his wife]]
Most gingerbread men share the same roughly humanoid shape, with stubby feet and no fingers. Many gingerbread men have a face, though whether the features are indentations within the face itself or other candies stuck on with [[Icing (food)|icing]] or [[chocolate]] varies from recipe to recipe. Other decorations are common; hair, shirt cuffs, and shoes are sometimes applied, but by far the most popular decoration are shirt [[button]]s, which are traditionally represented by [[gum drops]], icing, or raisins.

==In world records==
According to the 2009 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Guinness Book of Records]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the worldâ€™s largest gingerbread man was made on December 2, 2006 by the Smithville Area Chamber of Commerce in [[Smithville, Texas]], at their annual Festival of Lights celebration.  The gingerbread man weighed in at 1,308&amp;amp;nbsp;lbs, 8 oz (593.5&amp;amp;nbsp;kg),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Guinness World Records&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2009), p. 124&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and stood at over 20 feet (more than 6&amp;amp;nbsp;m).  On December 6, 2008, also in conjunction with the annual Festival of Lights celebration, a monument was dedicated in honor of the feat made from the very [[cookie sheet]] that was used to break the record.
