&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gisela of Burgundy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (died on July 21, 1006) was the daughter of [[Conrad of Burgundy|Conrad the Peaceful]], [[King of Burgundy]] and Adelaide of Bellay, Conrad&amp;apos;s second wife whom he probably married for love, as he had already produced an heir ([[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]]) by his first, more dynastic, marriage and was thus free to wed as he pleased. Gisela was a niece of the empress [[Adelaide of Italy|Adelaide]].

She married [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Quarrelsome]], [[Duke of Bavaria]] some time before 972. Although he died young, they had many children who acquired suitable positions among the ruling classes of Europe.
