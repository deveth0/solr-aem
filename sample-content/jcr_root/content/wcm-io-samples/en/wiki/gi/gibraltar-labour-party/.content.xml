{{Politics of Gibraltar}}
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gibraltar Labour Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[political party]] in [[Gibraltar]].  They described themselves as a [[progressivism|progressive]] [[socialism|socialist]] organisation and stated that their formation was prompted by the need for a strong opposition to the government. They were founded and led by [[Daniel Feetham]].

They opposed dialogue with [[Spain]] and wanted to change the [[Constitution of Gibraltar]], and support the right of Gibraltarians to decide their own constitutional arrangements under the principle of [[self-determination]].

They had proposed policies for the improvement of the quality and availability of [[house|housing]] in Gibraltar. They proposed that no individual should serve as [[Chief Minister of Gibraltar|Chief Minister]] for more than two terms, and called for a more transparent form of [[campaign finance|funding]] of political parties.

In the [[Gibraltar general election, 2003|2003 election]] to the 15-member [[Gibraltar Parliament|House of Assembly]] they polled 8.3 per cent of the vote and won no seats. They have since merged with the [[Gibraltar Social Democrats]].
