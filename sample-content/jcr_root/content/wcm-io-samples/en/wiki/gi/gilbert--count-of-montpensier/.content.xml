&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gilbert de Bourbon, Count of Montpensier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1443 – October 15, 1496, [[Pozzuoli]]) son of [[Louis I, Count of Montpensier|Louis de Bourbon]] and Gabrielle La Tour, [[Count of Montpensier]] and [[Dauphin d&amp;apos;Auvergne]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Biographical Dictionary of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Vol 4, (Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1844), 234.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was appointed to the [[Order of Saint Michael]] by [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] in October 1483.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Boulton, D&amp;apos;Arcy Jonathan Dacre, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The knights of the crown&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (The Boydell Press, 2000), 444.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Gilbert was the first person, after a number of divisions of [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] in Middle Ages, to carry the bloodlines of the respective dynasties of each of the three main divisions of Auvergne, the [[countship]], the [[Duke|dukedom]] and the [[List of rulers of Auvergne|dauphinate]].

His paternal grandmother [[Marie of Berry]], Duchess of Bourbon, was heiress to the [[duchy of Auvergne]].  The creation for the Berry and Bourbon branches was made of lands that were confiscated from the count of Auvergne by [[Philip II of France]].

His paternal great-grandmother Anne of Auvergne was daughter of the [[dauphin of Auvergne]] and after the extinction of her brother&amp;apos;s line, in her issue the heiress thereof.

Though Gilbert was by no means the primogenitural heir to any of them, as head of the cadet branch of his family, he received Montpensier and the dauphinate as [[appanage]]s inside the extended family.

On February 24, 1482 Gilbert married [[Clara Gonzaga]] (1 July 1464 – 2 June 1503), daughter of [[Federico I of Gonzaga]] of [[Mantua]]; they had the following issue:
*[[Louise de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpensier|Louise, Duchess of Montpensier]] (1482 – 5 July 1561), eventually the heiress of all the Bourbon estates, but not titles
*[[Louis II, Count of Montpensier]] (1483 – 14 August 1501)
*[[Charles III, Duke of Bourbon]] (17 February 1489 – 6 May 1527, in battle), from 1503 onwards the heir male of Bourbon ducal dynasty
*François, [[Duke of Châtellerault]] (1492 – 13 September 1515, [[Battle of Marignano]])
*[[Renée of Bourbon|Renée, Lady of Mercœur]] (1494 – May 26, 1539, [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]), married on June 26, 1515, at the [[Château d&amp;apos;Amboise]] to [[Antoine, Duke of Lorraine]]
*Anne (1495 – 1510, Spain)

He was made the [[Viceroy]] of [[Naples]] in 1495 by king [[Charles VIII of France]] after the conquest, losing it that same year to an allied Neapolitan/Spanish army commanded by [[Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba]].
