==History==
The Gimje area has been cultivated since ancient times.
Nations of early date ascend in year 200. [[Baekje]] Kingdom invaded and incorporated several small mahan states into herself in the 13th year of King Onjo’s reign.
After long times, [[Baekje]] Kingdom changed its name as Byeogol but its date is not clear.

[[Baekje]] Kingdom was ruined by [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Silla]] Kingdom and [[Unified Silla]] Kingdom changed into current term, Gimje city.

[[Goryeo]] dynasty raised up its position to Gimje District in the 21st year of [[Injong of Goryeo|King Injong]]’s reign.

In [[Joseon Dynasty]], Gimje firstly appeared in the year 1466 when [[Sejo of Joseon]] ruled. He promoted once again Gimje as independent county. In 1628, [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon]] combined near district called Mangyeong District into Gimje County.
&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;History of Gimje county was originally from city english page. http://www.gimje.go.kr/foreign/english/sub1/sub1.jsp&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Horizontal festival==
Gimje is the only one region where Koreans can see horizon in landlocked area. City government enhanced its cultural characteristic of cultivating rice and other species for a long time. Gimje was under [[Baekje]] Kingdom and was one of the best area for growing rice in the 20th century, too. The festival was appointed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Excellent Festival&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for 4 years since 2004. It also provided chance for city residents to feel traditional farming methods.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;김제 &amp;apos;지평선축제&amp;apos; 4년 연속 최우수축제 Yeonhap News 2007-12-23 http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;amp;mid=sec&amp;amp;sid1=101&amp;amp;oid=001&amp;amp;aid=0001869744&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
