&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gilles Ménage&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (August 15, 1613&amp;amp;nbsp;– July 23, 1692) was a [[France|French]] scholar.

==Biography==
He was born at [[Angers]], the son of Guillaume Ménage, king&amp;apos;s advocate at Angers. A good memory and enthusiasm for learning carried him quickly through his literary and professional studies, and he practised at the bar at Angers before he was twenty. In 1632, he pleaded several causes before the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[parlement]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of [[Paris]].

Illness caused him to abandon the legal profession for the church. He became [[prior]] of [[Montdidier, Somme|Montdidier]] without taking [[holy orders]], and lived for some years in the household of [[Jean François Paul de Gondi, cardinal de Retz|Cardinal de Retz]] (then coadjutor to the [[Archbishop of Paris]]), where he had leisure for literary pursuits.

Some time after 1648, he quarrelled with his patron and withdrew to a house in the cloister of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], where he gathered round him on Wednesday evenings those literary assemblies which he called “Mercuriales.” [[Jean Chapelain]], [[Paul Pellisson]], [[Valentine Conrart]], [[Jean François Sarrazin]] and Du Bos were among the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;habitués&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He was tutor to [[Marie-Madeleine Pioche de la Vergne, comtesse de la Fayette]], later the great writer, to whom he was very attached.  He was admitted to the [[Accademia della Crusca]] of [[Florence]], but his caustic sarcasm led to his exclusion from the [[Académie française]]. Ménage made many enemies and suffered under the satire of [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]] and of [[Molière]]. Molière immortalized him as the pedant Vadius in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Les Femmes savantes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a portrait Ménage pretended to ignore.

In 1664 he published at London an edition of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lives of Eminent Philosophers&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by Diogenes Laertius that contains an unedited anonymous life of Aristotle; this life was known as &amp;apos;Vita Menagiana&amp;apos; before the critical edition by Ingemar Düring, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aristotle in the ancient biographical tradition&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Stockholm: Almqvist &amp;amp; Wiksell 1957; reprinted New York, Garland, 1987, pp.&amp;amp;nbsp;80–93) with the title &amp;apos;Vita Hesychii&amp;apos; (the attribution to Hesychius of Miletus is controversial).

Ménage died at Paris in 1692. After his death his friends published, under the title of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Menagiana&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a collection of his witticisms and table talk. The edition of this collection by La Monnoye (2 vols., 1693/4) has found favor.&amp;lt;ref name=ac&amp;gt;{{Cite AmCyc|Ménage, Gilles}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
