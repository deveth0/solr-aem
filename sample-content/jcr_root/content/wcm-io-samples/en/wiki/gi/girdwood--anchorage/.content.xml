&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Girdwood&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an unincorporated year-round [[ski resort]] community within the [[Anchorage, Alaska|Municipality of Anchorage]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]]. It lies in a valley in the [[Chugach Mountains]] near the end of the Turnagain Arm of [[Cook Inlet]], 36 miles (61&amp;amp;nbsp;km) southeast of Anchorage proper.

It is surrounded by seven permanent [[glacier]]s. Summer activities include hiking, fishing and rafting, but Girdwood is best known for winter [[skiing]] and [[snowboarding]] at [[Alyeska Resort]] on [[Mount Alyeska]].
Girdwood also hosts the Girdwood Forest Fair every summer. Girdwood has the northernmost rain forest in the world.

==History==
Originally called &amp;quot;Glacier City,&amp;quot; Girdwood was founded as a supply camp for [[Placer mining|placer]] [[Gold mining|gold miners]] with claims along the creeks feeding Turnagain Arm. It was renamed for Colonel James Girdwood, a [[Belfast]]-born, [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] entrepreneur and linen merchant who staked the first four gold claims along Crow Creek in 1896.

The town was moved 2.5 miles (4&amp;amp;nbsp;km) up the valley after the devastating [[Good Friday Earthquake]] of 1964, when the land under the original townsite [[Subsidence|subsided]] into Turnagain Arm, putting much of the town below high tide. The land has not all since been reclaimed, as one can still see &amp;apos;drowned&amp;apos; cabins in the marshy areas where the city formerly extended. Significant earthquakes are a relatively common occurrence for Girdwood and the Kenai peninsula. Evidence has been discovered that indicates the area has seen six major quakes in the past 3300 years.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/external/reports/03HQGR0101.pdf &amp;quot;RECURRENT HOLOCENE PALEOSEISMICITY AND ASSOCIATED LAND / SEA LEVEL CHANGES IN THE GREATER ANCHORAGE AREA&amp;quot;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Girdwood was incorporated as a city in 1970 and became part of the Municipality of Anchorage when the Greater Anchorage Area Borough unified with the city of Anchorage in 1975.
The town has served as a backdrop for at least two films: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Chechahcos]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a [[1924 in film|1924]] [[silent film]] about the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], and [[Warren Miller (director)|Warren Miller]]&amp;apos;s [[1997 in film|1997]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Snowriders II&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Girdwood was the home of Alaska&amp;apos;s former senior [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Ted Stevens]], and Girdwood found itself in the media spotlight when the construction projects on Stevens&amp;apos; home became the subject of a federal investigation. [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold and silver medal-winning skier [[Tommy Moe]] also called Girdwood home during his High School years where he attended Glacier Creek Academy.

Girdwood was shown on [[CBS]] on January 20, 2008, as the Finish Line for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Amazing Race 12]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
