&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Giuseppe Montanelli&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (21 January 1813 â€“ 17 June 1862) was an Italian [[wikt:statesman|statesman]] and author.

== Biography ==
Montanelli was born at [[Fucecchio]], then part of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]. As a boy he was an organist and composer.&amp;lt;ref name=Appletons&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=Appletons&amp;apos; annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|year=1863|publisher=D. Appleton &amp;amp; Company|location=New York|page=689|url=http://archive.org/stream/1862appletonsan02newyuoft#page/n696/mode/1up}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  In 1840 was appointed law professor at [[Pisa]] after graduating law school when he was 18.&amp;lt;ref name=Appletons /&amp;gt;

He contributed to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Antologia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a celebrated Florentine review, and in 1847 founded a newspaper called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;L&amp;apos;Italia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the programme of which was &amp;quot;Reform and Nationality.&amp;quot; In 1848 Montanelli served with the Tuscan student volunteers at the [[battle of Curtatone]], where he was wounded and taken prisoner by the Austrians.

On being liberated he returned to Tuscany, and the [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|grand duke Leopold II]], knowing that he was popular with the masses, sent him to [[Livorno]] to quell the disturbances. In October, Leopold, much against his inclinations, asked him to form a ministry. He accepted, and on January 10, 1849, induced the grand duke to establish a national [[Constituent Assembly|constituent assembly]]. But Leopold, alarmed at the turn affairs were taking, fled from Florence, and Montanelli, [[Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi|Guerrazzi]] and [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzini]] were elected &amp;quot;triumvirs&amp;quot; of Tuscany. Like Mazzini, Montanelli advocated the union of Tuscany with Rome. But after the restoration of the grand duke, Montanelli, who was in Paris, was tried and condemned by default; he remained some years in France, where he became a partizan of [[Napoleon III]]. On the formation of the [[Unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] he returned to Tuscany and was elected member of [[Italian Parliament|parliament]].

Montanelli died at Fucecchio in 1862.

Although it has been reported that Indro Montanelli, the 20th century Italian journalist, is the grandson of Giuseppe Montanelli, there is in fact no relation between the two. Giuseppe had no children, and the family name of &amp;quot;Montanelli&amp;quot; was passed down through his sister as &amp;quot;Gori-Montanelli.&amp;quot;
