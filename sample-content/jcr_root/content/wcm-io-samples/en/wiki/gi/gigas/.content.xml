&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gigas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a popular term for races of giants in [[fantasy]] games. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gigas&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning &amp;quot;[[giant (mythology)|giant]]&amp;quot;, originally used to describe the race of [[Gigantes]] in [[Greek mythology]] and is used in the [[scientific name]], as the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]], of hundreds species of animals and dozens of plant species to denote their size.

The name has been used in [[Square (company)|Square]] games.  It was first used in this sense in the game &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Final Fantasy I]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and was subsequently used in many other Square games, such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Secret of Mana]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, often appearing as [[boss (video games)|sub-bosses]]. In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Final Fantasy VI]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; the character [[Umaro]] is said to have the strength of a gigas, and in [[Final Fantasy VII]] the character [[Vincent Valentine]] has a Limit Break in which he transforms into a monster called the &amp;apos;Death Gigas&amp;apos;. Gigas appear in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Final Fantasy XI]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as a race of [[Character design of Final Fantasy|Beastmen]] who live in Northern regions of [[Vana&amp;apos;diel]], the fictional world depicted in the game. In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Kingdom Hearts]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Goofy has an attack called Gigas Fist. Most recently, one of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Final Fantasy XII]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Espers, magic beasts summoned by the player, is named &amp;quot;Belias, the Gigas.&amp;quot;  According to the in-game bestiary, Belias is classified as a fusion of man and beast and considered a mistake by the gods. In addition, a fiend that guards the Stilshrine of Miriam area is known as the Blood Gigas. According to the in-game bestiary, the Blood Gigas is &amp;quot;a cruel and headless giant, born from the spilled blood of a demon.&amp;quot;

After its usage in Square games, the Gigas has appeared in other video game series, such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[List of Skies of Arcadia characters#Gigas|Skies of Arcadia]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The final [[Colossus_(disambiguation)#Statues|colossus]] in [[Sony]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Shadow of the Colossus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is known as Grand Gigas Malus. The Beast Spirit of Earth in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Digimon Frontier]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is called [[Gigasmon]]. The alternate spelling [[Giygas]] was used as the name of the final boss of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[EarthBound]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In the second series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (second series anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; anime the character [[Dartz]] uses a monster known as Orichalcos Gigas, which is another giant.  In the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pokémon]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; series, the name of the 486th &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pokémon]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is Regigigas, meaning royal giant.

The term has also been used to describe gigantic war constructs in the comic book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Gold Digger (comic)|Gold Digger]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Fred Perry]], and was the name of a [[simian]] monster from the [[Ultraman]] television series.
