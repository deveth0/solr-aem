        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gift&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 1993 film made by [[Perry Farrell]] and [[Casey Niccoli]] that features Farrell&amp;apos;s band [[Jane&amp;apos;s Addiction]].  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gift&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was released by [[Warner Brothers]].

The following Jane&amp;apos;s Addiction songs are featured in the soundtrack:

* &amp;quot;Stop&amp;quot;
* &amp;quot;Classic Girl&amp;quot;
* &amp;quot;Ain&amp;apos;t No Right&amp;quot;
* &amp;quot;Of Course&amp;quot;
* &amp;quot;Three Days&amp;quot;

In addition, John Frusciante (who would soon be replaced in the Red Hot Chili Peppers by Jane&amp;apos;s Addiction member Dave Navarro) recorded the song &amp;quot;Ants&amp;quot; which features in this film. This was later released on initial cassette versions of his album [[Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt]] in 1994, and accordingly credits the song to being from this film.

Farrell and rapper [[Ice-T]] also do a version of [[Sly and the Family Stone]]&amp;apos;s [[Don&amp;apos;t Call Me Nigger, Whitey]] in the film as well.

All of the filming for the movie took place around the time of the recording sessions for [[Ritual de lo Habitual]] in 1990.
