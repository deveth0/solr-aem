The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gilroy Garlic Festival&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of the largest [[food festival]]s in the [[United States]], held annually in [[Gilroy, California]] on the last full weekend in July at Christmas Hill Park.  The 2010 Garlic Festival was held from July 24â€“26, 2010.&amp;lt;ref name=faq&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://gilroygarlicfestival.com/?page_id=2 |title=FAQ&amp;apos;s &amp;amp; More|date=2009-05|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Past festivals==
The 31st festival ran from July 24 to July 26, 2009. 108,526 people attended, sampling such diverse creations as garlic flavored [[ice cream]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Vanilla ice cream is used as a base, with a subtle flavoring of garlic added.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and garlic [[french fries]]. Attendees also enjoy three stages full of musical entertainment, a Great [[Garlic]] [[Cook-off]], celebrity cooking demonstrations, a garlic braiding workshop, a children&amp;apos;s area, arts and crafts, and many interactive displays. A Miss Gilroy Garlic Festival Queen is also crowned yearly, chosen by a panel of five judges, based on her personal interview, talent, garlic speech and evening gown. Her court is also chosen, for the purpose of representing Gilroy at various festivities and &amp;quot;having a garlicy good time with fellow lovers of the pungent bulb.&amp;quot; The 2012 Gilroy Garlic Festival Queen is Julia Brewka. Over 4000 volunteers from more than 150 non-profit groups make the festival possible, and over three million people have reportedly come to the festival since it began.

==History and purpose==
The festival was founded in 1979 by Dr. [[Rudy Melone]], [[Don Christopher]], and [[Val Filice]], and has been a fundraiser for local [[Charitable trust|charities]], raising a total of about seven and a half million dollars for assorted causes. Individual groups and charities also run booths at the festival, raising additional funds for their causes. The Gilroy Garlic Festival Association is a non-profit organization intended to support non-profit groups and projects in Gilroy.
