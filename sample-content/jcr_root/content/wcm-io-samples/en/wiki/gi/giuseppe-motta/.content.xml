&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Giuseppe Motta&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (29 December 1871 - 23 January 1940) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] politician, member of the [[Swiss Federal Council]] (1911-1940) and [[President of the League of Nations]] (1924/1925).

He was elected to the [[Federal Council of Switzerland]] on December 14, 1911.

==Political affiliation and controversies==

He was affiliated with the [[Christian Democratic People&amp;apos;s Party of Switzerland]].

Motta is notorious for reneging on Switzerland&amp;apos;s treaty obligation to boycott Italy when Mussolini invaded Abyssinia.  Placing Switzerland&amp;apos;s economic advantage ahead of world peace, Motta refused to participate in the boycott of 1935, an act that led Italy to withdraw from the League of Nations and is considered to have been a contributory factor to the chain of events that led to the Second World War. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Steinberg, Jonathan, Why Switzerland?, second edition, Cambridge University Press, 1996, 2007, p. 63&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Test Case: Italy, Ethiopia, and the League of Nations, By George W. Baer,  Hoover Press, 1976, p. 25&amp;lt;/Ref&amp;gt;

While in office he held the following departments:
*[[Department of Finance (Switzerland)|Department of Finance]] (1912 - 1919)
*[[Political Department]] (1920 - 1940)
He was [[President of the Confederation (Switzerland)|President of the Confederation]] five times, in 1915, 1920, 1927, 1932 and 1937.  He was also President of the [[League of Nations]] from 1924-25.

==Death==
He died in office on 23 January 1940.

===Commemoration===
Among others, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;via Giuseppe Motta&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Lugano]], [[Chiasso]], [[Minusio]] and [[Massagno]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Piazza Giuseppe Motta]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Ascona]] and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Avenue Giuseppe-Motta]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Geneva]] are named for him.

His portrait was painted twice in the late 1930s by the Swiss-born American - and also Ticinese-born - artist [[Adolfo MÃ¼ller-Ury]] (1862-1947). The first, a large three-quarter portrait, dated 1938, hangs in the Archivio Cantonale in Bellinzona; the artist was sent a photograph by Motta at the end of 1937, and then the artist travelled to Berne in the summer of 1938 to work on the portrait from life. The second portrait, half-length seated at a desk and dated 1939, in the Haus Muller-Lombardi in [[Hospental]], Switzerland as part of the Adolfo Muller-Ury Stiftung. This was exhibited at the artist&amp;apos;s last exhibition at French and Co, New York in the Spring of 1947 and returned to Switzerland after his death in July that year.
