&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Girlfriend From Hell&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 1989 comedy/horror [[B-movie]] starring actor [[Dana Ashbrook]] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Twin Peaks]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; fame, and Liane Curtis of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sixteen Candles&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as well as several B-movies of the 1980s. Directed by Dan Peterson. The film has achieved as a small cult following (thanks to repeated screenings of the film on Comedy Central in the 1990s), and has even spawned a stage musical adaptation.

==Plot==
The film, a tongue-in-cheek satire of typical teen horror and sex comedies, chronicles a high school party where all [[Hell]] breaks loose, literally. In this case, the devil has taken over (and consequently vamped up) the body of a nerdy, socially awkward young woman attending the party.

==DVD release==

Lions Gate has yet to announce any plans to release the film onto DVD.

==Stage Musical==

In early 2011, playwright/composer Sean Matthew Whiteford adapted the film into a stage musical. The pop-rock musical features 20 original songs, a revamped storyline, while still using several of the original film&amp;apos;s characters, and using the film&amp;apos;s release date year, 1989, as the year the show is set in. The show opened for a test run at The Gene Frankel Theatre in NYC on July 21, 2011. The original Off-Off Broadway cast included Melissa Matthews as Maggie (the role originated by Liane Curtis in the film), Dana Gough, Gregory Krupp, Frank McGinnis, Foster Miller, Cassiopeia Ottulich, Matthew Patane, Juda Leah, Michael Siktberg, Sean Matthew Whiteford, and Margie Zarcone. The show is currently preparing for a new, revised production opening June 28, 2013 at the Center For Performing Arts in Rhinebeck, NY. The latest &amp;quot;supergroup&amp;quot; cast features Giuliana DePietro, Kerry Gibbons, Cassandra King, Juda Leah, Frank McGinnis, Olivia Rose Michaels, Matthew Patane, Michael Siktberg, Henry George Staats III, Sean Matthew Whiteford and now includes a large ensemble.
