        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ken Cooper&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Canada|Canadian]] politician who was the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] candidate for [[St. Boniface (electoral district)|St. Boniface]] [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004]] and [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]]s

Cooper has a degree in [[Civil Engineering]] from the [[University of Manitoba]], and a [[Master&amp;apos;s Degree]] in business administration from the Ivey School of Business at the [[University of Western Ontario]].  He has worked as a project manager for [[Imperial Oil]], and has served as chief executive of the [[Winnipeg Stock Exchange]] &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/1999/06/22/22061999_forest.html CBC,  Tuesday, June 22, 1999]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and Inland Trust in Winnipeg.  At the time of the 2004 election, Cooper was currently a managing director of Winnipeg Angel Organization and McLeod Harvest, and a governor of the [[Winnipeg Art Gallery]].

Cooper was a member of the PC Manitoba Fund board for several years, and assisted the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba|provincial]] and [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|federal]] Progressive Conservative parties in a number of campaigns.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes/riding/222/]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The 2004 election was his first as a candidate.  He received 11,956 votes (30.98%), finishing second against [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Raymond Simard]].  This was regarded as a credible showing in an area which is historically safe for the Liberals.

In early 2005, Cooper defeated Ed Sarna to win the Conservative nomination for the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]].  He was 61 years old at the time of the nomination meeting (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Winnipeg Free Press&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 17 May 2005).
He again lost to Raymond Simard in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 campaign]].
