&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kerensky–Krasnov uprising&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an attempt by [[Alexander Kerensky]] to regain power after the [[Bolsheviks]] overthrew his [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] in [[Petrograd]].

Following the [[October Revolution]], Kerensky fled Petrograd and went to [[Pskov]], where he rallied troops loyal to his cause in an attempt to retake the capital. He appointed [[Pyotr Krasnov]] to lead this army. Also cadets from military schools, the so-called [[Junker mutiny]] supported Kerensky in his bid to retake control of the government. His troops successfully captured [[Tsarskoe Selo]], but the next day were defeated at [[Pulkovo Heights|Pulkovo]]. The failure of the uprising led to Kerensky being forced to go into exile, eventually finding refuge in [[France]] and later the [[United States]].
