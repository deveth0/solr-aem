&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Keratosis pilaris&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;KP&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;follicular keratosis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;lichen pilaris&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;chicken skin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a common, [[autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]], [[genetics|genetic]] [[Hair follicle|follicular]] condition that is manifested by the appearance of rough, slightly red, bumps on the skin. It most often appears on the back and outer sides of the arm (though the forearm can also be affected), and can also occur on the [[thigh]]s, [[hands]], and tops of [[leg]]s, sides, [[buttocks]], or any body part except [[glabrous]] skin (like the palms or soles of feet).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news | first=Nili | last=Alai | coauthors= | title=Keratosis Pilaris (KP) | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.medicinenet.com/keratosis_pilaris/article.htm | work = MedicineNet | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-06 | language = }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Often the lesions will appear on the  [[face]], which may be mistaken for [[acne]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news | first=Kevin | last=Berman | coauthors= | title=Keratosis pilaris | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001462.htm | work =MedlinePlus | pages = | accessdate = 2008-06-19 | language = }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Classification==
Worldwide, KP affects an estimated 40%-50% of the adult population and approximately 50%-80% of all [[adolescent]]s. It is more common in women than in men.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news | first=Nili | last=Alai | coauthors=Arash Michael Saemi,Raul Del Rosario | title=Keratosis Pilaris | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic211.htm | work =eMedicine | pages = | accessdate = 2008-19-20 | language = }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

There are several different types of keratosis pilaris, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;keratosis pilaris rubra&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (red, inflamed bumps which can be on arms, head, legs), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;keratosis pilaris alba&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (rough, bumpy skin with no irritation), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;keratosis pilaris rubra faceii&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (reddish rash on the cheeks), and related disorders. KP is not related to [[goose bumps]], which results from a muscle contractions, except that both occur in the area where the hair follicle exits the skin.

==Symptoms and signs==
Keratosis pilaris occurs when the human body produces excess [[keratin]], a natural protein in the skin.  The excess keratin, which is cream colored, surrounds and entraps the [[hair follicles]] in the pore.  This causes the formation of hard plugs (process known as [[hyperkeratinization]]). Bearing only cosmetic consequence, the condition most often appears as a proliferation of tiny hard bumps that are seldom sore or itchy. Though people with keratosis pilaris experience this condition year-round, it is during the colder months, when moisture levels in the air are lower, that the problem can become exacerbated and the bumps are apt to look and feel more pronounced in color and texture.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/keratosis-pilaris/Pages/Introduction.aspx&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Many KP bumps contain an [[ingrown hair]] that has coiled.  This is a result of the keratinized skin&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;capping off&amp;quot; the hair follicle, preventing the hair from exiting.  The hair grows encapsulated inside the follicle.

==Treatments==
Treatments for Keratosis pilaris may consist of moisturizing or keratolytic treatments including: [[urea]], [[lactic acid]], [[salicylic acid]], or topical [[retinoids]]. However, the effectiveness of these treatments is limited and research to discover more effective treatments is ongoing.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5021/ad.2011.23.3.293 |year=2011 |last1=Park |first1=Juhee |last2=Kim |first2=Beom J |last3=Kim |first3=Myeung N | last4=Lee |first4=Chang K|journal=Annals of Dermatology |volume=23 |issue=3 |pmc=3162257 |title=A Pilot Study of Q-switched 1064-nm Nd:YAG Laser Treatment in the Keratosis Pilaris|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3162257/ |pages=293â€“298 |pmid=21909198}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
