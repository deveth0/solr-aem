From the early 1950s to about 1994, a small resort of about twelve cabins on North Keppel Island was operated by old Mr Walls, a former train driver. Old Mr Walls was assisted by his daughter, Geraldine, and her husband, who also lived on the island. His son Tim Walls operated the boat service to the Island, firstly in a boat called the Somerset, out of Ross Creek, Yeppoon, then in a larger boat called the Keppel Star, out of the Roslyn Bay Boat Harbour.

More recently the island has been run by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.
