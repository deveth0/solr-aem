&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kempley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] in the [[Forest of Dean (district)|Forest of Dean district]] of [[Gloucestershire]], England, close to the border with [[Herefordshire]]. It lies 12 miles northwest of [[Gloucester]] and is 5 and 8 miles respectively from the market towns of [[Newent]] and [[Ledbury]].

The small village (230 residents) has two notable churches, one dedicated to St Mary and another to St [[Edward the Confessor]].

[[St Mary&amp;apos;s Church, Kempley]] has in its chancel &amp;quot;the most complete set of [[Romanesque art#Murals|Romanesque]] [[fresco]]s in northern Europe&amp;quot;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/mar/21/religion.heritage The dazzling walls of medieval England deserve a bold restorer &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Guardian]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 21 March 2008]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; including the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Christ in Majesty]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; painting created in about 1120. On the walls of the nave are further images, including a wheel of life, showing the life cycle of man. These are worked in [[tempera]] painted on dry [[lime mortar]], unlike those in the chancel which are true frescoes. St Mary&amp;apos;s Church is owned by [[English Heritage]] and maintained by The Friends of Kempley Churches.&amp;lt;small&amp;gt;(Location: {{coord|51.9787|-2.4823|display=inline}})&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;

The Church has the oldest roof of any building in Britain, dating from 1120-1150&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/may/25/maevkennedy Treasure House: Church has Britain&amp;apos;s oldest roof, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Guardian]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 25 May 1999]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and has an unusually well-preserved interior. The churchyard is very beautiful in the early months of the year often being covered in [[wild daffodil]]s in late February and early March.

The [[St Edward&amp;apos;s Church, Kempley|Church of St Edward]] (1903), described by [[Betjeman]] as &amp;quot;a mini-cathedral of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]&amp;quot;, was built from local materials by local labour, under the direction of [[Randall Wells]], clerk of works at All Saints, [[Brockhampton-by-Ross]]. The church was planned by the Lord of the Manor and major landowner, [[William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp]], because St Mary&amp;apos;s was too far away from the main centres of population in the parish at Kempley Green and Fishpool, and liable to flooding. The walls of the church are in Forest of Dean red sandstone.

The village maintains the Kempley Tardis (a redundant [[Red telephone box|telephone box]]) - a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] funded project supported by [[English Heritage]]. The project, which is run by the Friends of Kempley Churches, aims to archive and document the entire social, economic and cultural history of the village.

In March 1994 fields near the village were found to contain the remains of two of the victims of serial killer [[Fred West]].
