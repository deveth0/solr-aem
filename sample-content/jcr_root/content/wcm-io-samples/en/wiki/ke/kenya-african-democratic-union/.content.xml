{{Politics of Kenya}}
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kenya African Democratic Union&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (KADU) was a political party in [[Kenya]].  It was founded in 1960 when several leading politicians refused to join [[Jomo Kenyatta]]&amp;apos;s [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU).  It was led by [[Ronald Ngala]]. KADU&amp;apos;s aim was to defend the interests of the so-called KAMATUSA (an acronym for [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]], [[Maasai people|Maasai]], [[Turkana people|Turkana]] and [[Samburu people|Samburu]] ethnic groups), against the dominance of the larger [[Luo (Kenya)|Luo]] and [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] that comprised the majority of KANU&amp;apos;s membership.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal |author=Joshia Osamba |year=2001 |title=The dynamics of ethnopolitical conflict and violence in the Rift valley province of Kenya |journal=Nationalism and Ethnic Politics |publisher= |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=87â€“112 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a788863585 |doi= |pmid= |pmc= }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
KADU lost the first general elections in Kenya in 1963, where it had campaigned on a platform of [[Majimbo]]ism. It&amp;apos;s delegation at Kenya&amp;apos;s Lancaster house constitutional conference negotiated for and got federalism adopted into Kenya&amp;apos;s independence constitution.  This involved 8 &amp;apos;jimbos&amp;apos; with regional presidents. It dissolved in 1964 and merged into KANU. [[Daniel arap Moi]] the former President of Kenya who ruled for 24 years was KADU&amp;apos;s chairman and attended the [[Lancaster House Conferences (Kenya)|Lancaster House Conferences]] with Ronald Ngala.
