&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Keōua Hale&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the palace of [[Ruth Keelikōlani|Princess Ruth Ke{{okina}}elikōlani]] at 1302 Queen Emma Street in [[downtown Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]].

== History ==
The mansion was built upon the site of Princess Ruth and her adoptive son [[Leleiohoku II|Leleiohoku]]&amp;apos;s residence in Honolulu, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ka{{okina}}akopua&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It burned down in 1873 and plans were made to build a grander palace on the location. In the mean time Ke{{okina}}elikōlani and Leleiohoku resided in another house on King&amp;apos;s Street until the house was completed, although most of her time were spent on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island of Hawaii]] at the [[Hulihee Palace]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Zambucka&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book| author=Kristin Zambucka |title=The High Chiefess: Ruth Keelikolani |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iZNpEIgcNHAC |year=1872 |publisher=Kristin Zambucka Books |isbn= |page=5}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Zambucka&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book| author=Kristin Zambucka |title=The High Chiefess: Ruth Keelikolani |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iZNpEIgcNHAC |year=1977 |publisher=Mana Pub. Co. |isbn= |page= }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;{{rp|47}} Leleiohoku never saw the building completed, dying in 1877.

The main architect behind new structure was Charles J. Hardy, an American from Chicago, employed at the Enterprise Planing
Mill in Honolulu. The gaslit interior of the mansion was celebrated for its ornate plaster work and frescoes.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Peterson&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |title= Pioneer Architects and Builders of Honolulu |author= Charles E. Peterson |id= {{hdl|10524/80}} |year= 1964 |volume= |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society |pages=7–28}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It followed the [[Second Empire architecture]], or so-called French style of architecture, and was considered a classical Victorian-style mansion. Surrounded by extensive, well-kept gardens, it was characterized by mansard roof, broad lanais, from which lofty flights of steps led down into the gardens, and a large drawing-room upon the ceiling of which was emblazoned the [[Hawaiian coat of arms]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Krout&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |title= The Memoirs of Hon. Bernice Pauahi Bishop |author= Mary Hannah Krout |page= 205 |year= 1908 |publisher= The Knickerbocker Press |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=sJWPTcOemmsC }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the spring of 1883 Princess Ruth completed the building, and gave a grand [[luau]] to celebrate the event. It was larger than the [[ʻIolani Palace]]. This was followed by a ball in the evening, which was attended by all the best society of [[Honolulu]], whether of native or foreign birth. But after this festivity the princess was taken suddenly ill, and left for [[Kailua, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Kailua]] on [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i island]] hoping to restore her health. She received medical attention, but did not recover. On 24 May her remains were brought back to Honolulu, and [[Lying in state|lay in state]] in the new house. It was later inherited by Princess [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop|Bernice Pauahi]] who died in it.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/liliuokalani/hawaii/hawaii-3.html |author=[[Liliuokalani|Lili{{okina}}uokalani]], Queen of Hawaii (1838-1917) |work=Hawaii&amp;apos;s Story by Hawaii&amp;apos;s Queen |title=Chapters XVI-XXVIII |year=1898 |accessdate=2009-05-05 |publisher=Boston: Lee and Shepard }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
