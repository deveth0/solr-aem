&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Keredic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-cy|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ceredig&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}) was a [[List of legendary kings of Britain|legendary king of the Britons]], as recounted by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]. The origin of Geoffrey&amp;apos;s character is unknown, but he is not depicted as a [[Saxons|Saxon]]. According to Geoffrey, Keredic&amp;apos;s rule was so unpopular that the Saxons enlisted the aid of an army of [[Vandals]] from [[Ireland]] to drive him from his kingdom.

Geoffrey&amp;apos;s legendary Keredic may have been a conflation of [[Cerdic of Wessex|Cerdic]], the traditional founder of Wessex, who, despite his political affiliation with the Saxons, was likely to be half-British himself, and another [[Cerdic of Elmet|Cerdic]], who reigned over the [[Celt]]ic kingdom of [[Elmet]] around present-day [[Leeds]] until his defeat at the hands of [[Edwin of Northumbria]]. Whatever the case, Geoffrey places a lengthy interregnum between the expulsion of Keredic and the rise of the next British king, [[Cadfan]].

Keredic should not be confused with [[Ceredig]], one of the sons of [[Cunedda]] and traditional founder of [[Ceredigion]].
