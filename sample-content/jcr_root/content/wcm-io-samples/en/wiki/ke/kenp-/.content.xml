{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kenpō&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|[[wikt:拳法|拳法]]}} is the name of several [[Japanese martial arts]]. The word kenpō is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] translation of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;quán fǎ&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;. This term is often informally [[transliterated]] as &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;kempo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;, as a result of applying [[Hepburn romanization|Traditional Hepburn romanization]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Hepburn romanization provides for use of the letter &amp;quot;m&amp;quot; when [[n (kana)|ん]] precedes a [[labial consonant]] such as &amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; but failing to use a [[macron]] to indicate the [[vowel length|long vowel]]. The generic nature of the term combined with its widespread, cross-cultural adoption in the martial arts community has led to many divergent definitions.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Kempo&amp;apos;s Tai Chi Connection|work= Kung Fu Magazine|date=|url=http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=505|accessdate=2010-02-06}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==American Kenpo==
Kenpō has also been appropriated as a modern term: a name for multiple martial arts that developed in [[Hawaii]] due to cross-cultural exchange between practitioners of [[Ryukyuan martial arts]], [[Chinese martial arts]], [[Japanese martial arts]] and multiple additional influences.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Rathbone, Jim. &amp;quot;James Mitose and the Path of Kenpo&amp;quot; 2006 White Tiger Productions.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In the [[United States]], kenpo is often referred to as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kenpo Karate&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The most widespread styles have their origin in the teachings of [[James Mitose]] and [[William Kwai Sun Chow]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}. The American East Coast features a branch of Kenpo created by George Pesare a student of Karazenpo co-founder Sonny Gascon. This branch was later built upon and redefined by [[Fredrick J. Villari]]. The Villari system integrated the strengths of American Kenpo with the larger scope of movement and grappling available in [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] and [[Chin Na]] to create a unique American Kenpo offshoot system.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ayoob, Massad. &amp;quot;Fred Villari Markets the Martial Arts&amp;quot;. Black Belt Magazine, July 1975.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The form of martial art developed and taught by Mitose and Chow also includes [[Kajukenbo]], an art that does not use the kenpō name itself, but which possesses recognized offshoots that do.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} These arts have spread around the world through multiple lineages, not all of which agree on a common historical narrative. The system of Kenpo taught by founder James Mitose employed hard linear strikes and kicks, pressure point manipulation, circular movement patterns, and joint locking and breaking.

[[Ed Parker]] is the most prominent name in the Mitose lineage. A student of William Chow in Hawaii for nearly six months, Ed Parker moved to the US mainland to attend Brigham Young University. In 1957, he began teaching the Kenpo Karate that he had learned from Chow, and throughout his life modified and refined the art until it became Ed Parker&amp;apos;s [[American Kenpo]]. It employs a blend of Chinese circular movements and hard linear movements, which come together seamlessly to form an effective self defense system. Parker created techniques with names such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thundering Hammers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Five Swords&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Prance Of The Tiger&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Flashing Mace&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to provide a memorization tool to the student.

==Okinawan/ Ryukyuan usage==
Some [[Okinawan martial arts]] groups use the term kenpō as an alternate name for their [[Karate]] systems or for a distinct but related art within their association.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} This can be illustrated by the International Shorin-Ryu Karate Kobudo Federation (http://www.worldbudokan.com), where [[Shōrin-ryū]] is the actual karate style practiced, whereas &amp;quot;hakutsuru kenpo&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;hakutsuru kenpo karate&amp;quot; is a related but distinctive style also taught by the association. Both the &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;m&amp;quot; romanizations are used by various groups.
