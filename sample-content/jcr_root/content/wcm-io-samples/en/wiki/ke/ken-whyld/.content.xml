        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kenneth Whyld&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (6 March 1926 – 11 July 2003) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[chess]] author and researcher, best known as the co-author (with [[David Vincent Hooper|David Hooper)]] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Oxford Companion to Chess]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the standard single-volume chess reference work in English.

Whyld was a strong amateur chess player, taking part in the [[British Chess Championship]] in 1956 and winning the county championship of [[Nottinghamshire]]. He subsequently made his living in [[information technology]] while writing books on chess and researching its history.

As well as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Oxford Companion to Chess]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Whyld was the author of other reference works such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chess: The Records&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1986), an adjunct to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Guinness Book of Records]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the comprehensive &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Collected Games of [[Emanuel Lasker]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1998). He also researched more esoteric subjects, resulting in works such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alekhine Nazi Articles&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2002) on  articles in favour of the Nazi Party supposedly written by world chess champion [[Alexander Alekhine]], and the bibliographies &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fake Automata in Chess&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1994) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chess Columns: A List&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2002).

From 1978 until his death in 2003, Whyld wrote the &amp;quot;Quotes and Queries&amp;quot; column in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[British Chess Magazine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Shortly after Whyld&amp;apos;s death, the Ken Whyld Association was established with the aim of compiling a comprehensive chess bibliography in database form and promoting chess history.

Whyld&amp;apos;s library was later sold to the [[Musée Suisse du Jeu]], located on the shores of [[Lake Geneva]] in [[Switzerland]] (as reported in [http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg.html number 152] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[EG (magazine)|EG]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).
