&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kelmscott&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a village and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] on the [[River Thames]] in [[West Oxfordshire]], about {{convert|2|mi|0}} east of [[Lechlade]] in neighbouring [[Gloucestershire]].

==Parish church==
The [[nave]] of the [[Church of England parish church]] of [[Saint George]] was built in about 1190 in the transitional style between [[Norman architecture|Norman]] and [[English Gothic architecture#Early English Gothic|Early English]], and the [[chancel]] is probably of the same date.&amp;lt;ref name=Sherwood665&amp;gt;{{harvnb|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=665.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The building has [[transept]]s that were added in about 1260.&amp;lt;ref name=Sherwood665/&amp;gt; The [[clerestory]] of the nave was added in the 15th century.&amp;lt;ref name=Sherwood665/&amp;gt; Many of the windows of the nave and chancel are [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular Gothic]] additions, including the east window of the chancel.&amp;lt;ref name=Sherwood665/&amp;gt;

In the churchyard is the [[tomb]] of [[William Morris]], designed by [[Philip Webb]]. Morris featured the church in his novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[News from Nowhere]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, when in the final part of the book the Guest is taken there for the feast.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

St George&amp;apos;s parish is now part of the [[Benefice#Church of England|Benefice]] of Shill Valley and Broadshire, which includes also the parishes of [[Alvescot]], [[Black Bourton]], [[Broadwell, Oxfordshire|Broadwell]], [[Broughton Poggs]], [[Filkins]], [[Holwell, Oxfordshire|Holwell]], [[Kencot, Oxfordshire|Kencot]], [[Langford, Oxfordshire|Langford]], [[Little Faringdon]], [[Shilton, Oxfordshire|Shilton]] and [[Westwell, Oxfordshire|Westwell]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.achurchnearyou.com/benefice.php?B=27/441BF |title=Benefice of Shill Valley and Broadshire |author=[[Archbishops&amp;apos; Council]] |publisher=[[Church of England]] |year=2010 |accessdate=28 June 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Kelmscott Manor==
[[Kelmscott Manor]] is a [[Cotswold stone]] house, built in about 1570 during the [[Great Rebuilding]] of England and extended late in the 17th century.&amp;lt;ref name=Sherwood665/&amp;gt; It was the country home of [[William Morris]] from 1871 until his death in 1896. He drew great inspiration from the unspoilt authenticity of the house&amp;apos;s architecture and craftsmanship, and its organic relationship with its setting.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Kelmscott Manor now belongs to the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.kelmscottmanor.org.uk/ Kelmscott Manor]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Morris renamed his [[London]] town house [[Kelmscott House]] after Kelmscott when he bought it in April 1879. He named his private press, which he started in 1891, [[Kelmscott Press]].
