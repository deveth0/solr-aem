&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;William Keith McDonald&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born February 8, 1973 in [[Yokosuka (city)|Yokosuka]], [[Japan]]) is a former [[Major League Baseball]] [[catcher]] and right-handed batter. He made his debut with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in 2000.

On July 4, 2000 McDonald became the third player in St. Louis history to hit a [[home run]] in his first major league [[At bat|at-bat]]. On [[2000 in sports|July 6]], he homered in his second at-bat, becoming only the second player in MLB history to hit HRs in each of his first two big league at bats. [[Bob Nieman]], in 1951, is the other. McDonald hit a third home run that year, and is the only player in MLB history to have more than one home run in a career, but no other hits.

In his first season McDonald [[batting average|batted]] .429 (3-7), with three homers, five [[run batted in|RBI]] and three [[Run (baseball statistics)|runs]] in six games. He returned the following season as a September call-up, and was hitless in two at-bats.
