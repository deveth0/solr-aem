{{NZ parlbox footer}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kenneth Xiaoxuan Wang&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Chinese 王小选)(born 1955) was a [[New Zealand]] politician and businessman, and a member of the [[ACT New Zealand]] party. He entered [[Parliament of New Zealand|Parliament]] to replace [[Donna Awatere Huata]], who was expelled from [[Parliament of New Zealand|Parliament]] on 19 November 2004.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;amp;objectid=3612917|title=New MP joins Act in Parliament|date=23 November 2004|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Wang was sworn in on 30 November 2004.

Wang was born in [[China]], and has three siblings. He arrived in New Zealand in 1984 and is married with two children. Wang worked in the [[marketing]] and [[advertising]] sector in [[Auckland]]. He was New Zealand&amp;apos;s second Chinese MP (with the first being [[Pansy Wong]]).

At the [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005 elections]] Wang contested the seat of Mt Roskill, and was seventh on [[Act New Zealand|ACT]]&amp;apos;s party list. However, he was not returned to [[Parliament of New Zealand|Parliament]].

In the [[New Zealand general election, 2008|2008 general election]] he stood unsuccessfully in the Electorate of [[Botany (New Zealand electorate)|Botany]] for the [[ACT New Zealand]] Party. National candidate [[Pansy Wong]] filed a complaint to the electoral commission about Wang&amp;apos;s billboards which exhorted &amp;quot;Vote for Wang, get Wang and Wong&amp;quot; (because Pansy Wong&amp;apos;s high rank on the National Party List assured her of a seat in parliament).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.times.co.nz/cms/news/2008/10/wang_wong_gone_wrong.php|title=Wang Wong gone wrong |date=2 October 2008|work=Howick and Pakuranga Times|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz-election-2008/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501799&amp;amp;objectid=10541171|title=Wang accuses opponent of dirty tactics|last=Tan |first=Lincoln |date=5 November 2008|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
