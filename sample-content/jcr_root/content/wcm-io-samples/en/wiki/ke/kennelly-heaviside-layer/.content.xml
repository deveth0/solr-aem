The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kennelly–Heaviside layer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, named after [[Arthur Edwin Kennelly]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]], also known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;E region&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or simply the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Heaviside layer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a layer of [[ionisation|ionised]] [[gas]] occurring between roughly 90–150&amp;amp;nbsp;km (56–93&amp;amp;nbsp;mi) above the ground &amp;amp;mdash; one of several layers in the [[Earth]]&amp;apos;s [[ionosphere]]. It reflects [[mediumwave|medium-frequency]] [[radio wave]]s, and because of this [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[radio wave]]s can be [[radio propagation|propagated]] beyond the [[horizon]].

Propagation is affected by time of day. During the daytime the [[solar wind]] presses this layer closer to the Earth, thereby limiting how far it can reflect radio waves.  Conversely, on the night ([[windward and leeward|lee]]) side of the Earth, the solar wind drags the ionosphere further away, thereby greatly increasing the range which radio waves can travel by reflection, called [[skywave]]. The extent of the effect is further influenced by the [[season]], and the amount of [[sunspot]] activity.

==History==
Its existence was predicted in 1902 independently and almost simultaneously by the American electrical engineer [[Arthur Edwin Kennelly]] (1861–1939) and the British physicist [[Oliver Heaviside]] (1850–1925). However, it was not until 1924 that its existence was shown by British scientist [[Edward V. Appleton]], for which he received the 1947 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. In 1925, Americans [[Gregory Breit]] and [[Merle A. Tuve]] first mapped its variations in altitude.

==Cultural impact==
The &amp;quot;Heaviside layer&amp;quot; is used as a symbol for heaven (in the afterlife sense) in [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]&amp;apos;s musical &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This reference is based on a quotation found in a letter written by [[T. S. Eliot]], whose book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Old Possum&amp;apos;s Book of Practical Cats]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; forms the basis of the musical. In the musical, one cat is chosen each year by [[Old Deuteronomy]] to go to the Heaviside Layer and begin a new life. In the song &amp;quot;The Journey to the Heaviside Layer&amp;quot;, it is stated that the Heaviside Layer is &amp;quot;past the [[Hotel Russell|Russell Hotel]]&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;past the Jellicle moon&amp;quot;, indicating that it is very far away and difficult to access.

In the end of the musical, [[Grizabella]] is chosen to go the Heaviside Layer. She does so by ascending on a flying tire until she reaches a structure resembling clouds, into which she disappears, although in the film version of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cats&amp;apos;&amp;apos; she ascends with [[Old Deuteronomy]] and then she walks up a giant metal hand to the Heaviside layer.

Eliot also refers to the &amp;quot;Heaviside Layer&amp;quot; in his play &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Family Reunion]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which explores issues around the afterlife, heaven and hell.

In [[Tim Powers]] supernatural spy novel &amp;quot;[[Declare]]&amp;quot; the Heaviside layer is the realm of the &amp;quot;spirits of the upper air&amp;quot;.

In [[Thomas Pynchon]]&amp;apos;s 1964 short story &amp;quot;[[The Secret Integration]],&amp;quot; a boy&amp;apos;s dreams are affected &amp;quot;when the thing in the sky, the Heaviside layer, was right for it.&amp;quot;
