&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kerry Leigh Prendergast&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[New Zealand Order of Merit|CNZM]] (born 28 March 1953) was the 33rd [[Mayor of Wellington]] (2001–2010). She was the second woman to serve as Mayor of [[Wellington]], succeeding [[Mark Blumsky]].

==Before politics==
Prendergast&amp;apos;s professional background is in the health sector as a registered nurse and, for twenty five years, a midwife. She continued her midwifery role alongside her local government work until 2001. She has also been a voluntary grief counsellor. She holds a [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] degree from [[Victoria University of Wellington]].

==Local body politics==

Prendergast  has had a long career in local body politics, having started her political life as a [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa Borough]] councillor in 1986.

In 1989 she was elected to [[Wellington City Council]] and was re-elected every three years until 2010.

In 1995 Prendergast became Deputy Mayor to [[Mark Blumsky]].

In the [[New Zealand general election, 1999|1999 general election]] Prendergast stood as a [[New Zealand National Party|National]] list candidate, ranked 30th on the party&amp;apos;s list. However, the National Party did not gain enough of the party vote for Prendergast to enter [[Parliament of New Zealand|Parliament]]. She considered running again at the [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 election]], but in 2001 Mark Blumsky announced his intention not to run for the mayoralty again, and endorsed Prendergast&amp;apos;s mayoralty candidacy.

===Mayor of Wellington===
Prendergast was elected mayor in 2001 and re-elected in 2004 and 2007. During her time as Mayor, Prendergast instigated the policy of making Wellington the &amp;quot;Creative Capital&amp;quot;. She has endorsed changing the [[Flag of New Zealand]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nzflag.com/endorsements.cfm?i=22 NZ Flag.com – Kerry Prendergast]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the [[Wellington City mayoral election, 2010]], Prendergast was challenged by [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand]] city councillor [[Celia Wade-Brown]] for the Wellington mayoralty. After the counting of special votes, Wade-Brown was declared the winner of a close Wellington mayoral contest by a one hundred and seventy six vote margin, ending nearly a decade of Prendergast&amp;apos;s mayoralty.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;3_News_181150&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Celia-Wade-Brown-wins-Wellington/tabid/419/articleID/181150/Default.aspx |title=Celia Wade Brown wins Wellington |author=Watts, Jerram |date=13 October 2010 |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Voluntary work==
Prendergast is Vice President of Local Government New Zealand and a trustee of the Joe Aspell Trust and the New Zealand International Festival of the Arts.  She is also an honorary life member of the [[Katherine Mansfield Birthplace]] Society.

Prendergast is patron of a number or Wellington organisations and a director of [[Wellington International Airport]] Limited and the Wellington Region Association of Midwives.

She is married and has two daughters and a son. Her son was killed on 31 March 2011 in a riding accident.

In the 2011 Queen&amp;apos;s Birthday Honours, she was made a Companion of the [[New Zealand Order of Merit]], for services to local body affairs.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=The Queen&amp;apos;s Birthday Honours 2011|url=http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/lists/list.asp?id=58|work=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|date=6 June 2011|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
