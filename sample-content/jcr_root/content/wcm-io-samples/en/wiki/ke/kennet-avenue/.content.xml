&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kennet Avenue&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;West Kennet Avenue&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[prehistoric]] site in the [[England|English]] county of [[Wiltshire]].

It was an [[avenue (archaeology)|avenue]] of two parallel lines of stones 25m wide and 2.5&amp;amp;nbsp;km in length which ran between the [[Neolithic]] sites of [[Avebury]] and [[The Sanctuary]]. A second avenue, called [[Beckhampton Avenue]] led west from Avebury towards [[Beckhampton Long Barrow]].

Excavations by [[Stuart Ernest Piggott|Stuart Piggott]] and [[Alexander Keiller (archaeologist)|Alexander Keiller]] in the 1930s indicated that around 100 pairs of standing stones had lined the avenue and that they dated to around 2200 BC based on finds of [[Beaker people|Beaker]] burials found beneath some of the stones. Many stones have since fallen or are missing however.

Keiller and Piggott righted some of the fallen stones they excavated as did [[Maud Cunnington]] during her earlier work there. More recently the stones have been the subject of vandalism when red paint was thrown over some of them.

It is part of the Avebury World Heritage Site. West Kennet Avenue is in the freehold ownership of [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|The National Trust]] and in [[English Heritage]] guardianship. It is managed by The National Trust on behalf of English Heritage, and the two organisations share the cost of managing and maintaining the property.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/west-kennet-avenue/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
