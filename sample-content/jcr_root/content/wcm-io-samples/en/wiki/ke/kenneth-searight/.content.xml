        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kenneth Searight&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arthur Kenneth Searight&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (c. December 1883–28 February 1957) was the creator of the [[international auxiliary language]] [[Sona language (artificial)|Sona]]. His book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sona; an auxiliary neutral language&amp;apos;&amp;apos; outlines the language&amp;apos;s grammar and vocabulary. Encounters with Searight also influenced English author [[E.M. Forster]]&amp;apos;s world-view, particularly with regard to soldiers.&amp;lt;ref name=tambling&amp;gt;{{citation |title=E. M. Forster: Contemporary Critical Essays |last=Tambling |first=Jeremy |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |year=1995 |isbn=0-312-12359-0 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Searight was born in Kensington, England in December 1883. He attended [[Charterhouse School]] (a boarding school) for his childhood and teenage years. In 1904 he received a commission into the Queen&amp;apos;s Own Western Kent Regiment, and was stationed for several years in India. It was here that he befriended English author [[E.M. Forster]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Passage to India&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and [[Cambridge]] don [[Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson|G.L. Dickinson]]. His regiment was later reassigned to Iraq, and then to Egypt. Searight also enjoyed leave time around the Mediterranean Sea—especially in Italy.

It was during this extensive travel that Searight developed his interest in linguistics and his familiarity with Middle Eastern and Far Eastern languages and cultures.

Searight retired to Rome in 1926. In 1934 he contacted [[Charles Kay Ogden]] to discuss publishing the Sona book. Ogden was the creator of a modified version of English known as &amp;quot;[[Basic English]]&amp;quot;, which consisted of a reduced vocabulary (only 850 words) and simplified grammar. Ogden was also the editor of the Psyche Miniatures series at Cambridge University, and he approved and published the Sona book, as well as writing an introduction for it.

Searight was a [[homosexual]].&amp;lt;ref name=aldrich&amp;gt;{{citation |title=Colonialism and Homosexuality |last=Aldrich |first=Robert |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=0-415-19616-7 |pages=279–81 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; There is some reason to believe that Searight was the model for the hero of Forster&amp;apos;s novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Maurice (novel)|Maurice]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Although the Sona book is Searight&amp;apos;s only published work, he also compiled a 600-page manuscript work called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Paidikion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It was made up of homoerotic stories, a detailed listing of his sexual conquests—the &amp;quot;Paidiology&amp;quot;—and a 137-page verse autobiography entitled &amp;quot;The Furnace&amp;quot;.

Searight died in 1957. Ogden originally received the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Paidikion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but it was later retrieved from a used bookstore for half a crown. The book was never published as a whole, but excerpts were included in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;International Journal of Greek Love&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1966.
