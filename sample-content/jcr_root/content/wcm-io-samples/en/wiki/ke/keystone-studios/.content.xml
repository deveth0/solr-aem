&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Keystone Studios&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an early [[movie studio]] founded in [[Edendale, Los Angeles, California|Edendale, California]] in 1912 as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Keystone Pictures Studio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Mack Sennett]] with backing from Adam Kessel and [[Charles O Baumann|Charles O. Baumann]], owners of the New York Motion Picture Company. The company filmed in and around Glendale and [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] for several years, and its films were distributed by the [[Mutual Film Corporation]] between 1912 and 1915.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/companies/M/mutualFilmCorp.html &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mutual Film Corporation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;] at Silent Era. Retrieved 2012-01-30.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The studio is perhaps best remembered for the era under Mack Sennett when he created the [[slapstick]] antics of the [[Keystone Kops]], from 1912, and for the [[Sennett Bathing Beauties]], beginning in 1915.  [[Charlie Chaplin]] got his start at Keystone when Sennett hired him fresh from his [[vaudeville]] career to make [[silent film]]s. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Charlie Chaplin at Keystone Studios&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 1993 compilation of some of the most notable films Chaplin made at Keystone, documenting his transition from [[vaudeville]] player to true comic film actor to director. In 1915 Keystone Studios became an autonomous production unit of the [[Triangle Film Corporation]] with [[D. W. Griffith]] and [[Thomas H. Ince|Thomas Ince]]. In 1917 Sennett gave up the Keystone trademark and organized his own company.

Many other important actors also began their careers at Keystone, including [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Louise Fazenda]], [[Raymond Griffith]], [[Ford Sterling]], [[Fatty Arbuckle]], [[Marie Dressler]], [[Mabel Normand]], [[Ben Turpin]], [[Harry Langdon]] and [[Chester Conklin]].

Sennett, by then a celebrity, departed the studio in 1917 to produce his own independent films (eventually distributed through [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]). Keystone&amp;apos;s business decreased after his departure, and finally closed after bankruptcy in 1935.

Much of the lighting &amp;amp; studio equipment from Keystone was bought by Reymond King - who started the &amp;quot;Award Cinema Movie Equipment&amp;quot; company in Venice, California in November, 1935.

The name &amp;quot;Keystone Studios&amp;quot; was used later as a production label for Cineville and was named as the fictional studio in the Cineville production &amp;quot;Swimming With Sharks&amp;quot; starring Kevin Spacey.
A new legal corporate entity named Keystone Studios began again during 2005.  The two owners are Carl Colpaert and Lee Caplin.  Keystone obtained its new trademark in 2006.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Robertson, Willa (2007-07-18).

Retrieved 2012-01-30.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The Keystone Studios lot was an explorable location, as well as a major plot element, in the 2011 video game &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[L.A. Noire]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, published by [[Rockstar Games]].
