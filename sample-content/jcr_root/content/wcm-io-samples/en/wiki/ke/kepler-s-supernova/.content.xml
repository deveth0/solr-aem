__NOTOC__
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Supernova 1604&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kepler&amp;apos;s Supernova&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kepler&amp;apos;s Nova&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kepler&amp;apos;s Star&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was a [[supernova]] that occurred in the [[Milky Way]], in the constellation [[Ophiuchus]]. It is the most recent supernova to have been unquestionably observed by the naked eye in our own [[galaxy]], occurring no farther than 6 [[parsec|kiloparsecs]] or about 20,000 [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]].

Visible to the [[naked eye]], Kepler&amp;apos;s Star was brighter at its peak than any other [[star]] in the [[night sky]], and all the [[planets]] other than [[Venus]], with [[apparent magnitude]] &amp;amp;minus;2.5. It was visible during the day for over three weeks.

The first recorded observation was in northern Italy on October 9, 1604.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;L. Colombe, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Discorso, Nel quale si dimostra, che la nuova Stella apparita l&amp;apos;Octobre passato 1604 nel Sagittario...&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Florence, n.d.).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Johannes Kepler]] began observing it in [[Prague]] on October 17.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Citation |url=http://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/~wpb/Kepler/kepler.html |title=Bill Blair&amp;apos;s Kepler&amp;apos;s Supernova Remnant Page |accessdate=October 7, 2009 }}.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  It was subsequently named after him because his observations tracked the object for an entire year and because of his book on the subject, entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Stella nova in pede Serpentarii&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;On the new star in Ophiuchus&amp;apos;s foot&amp;quot;, Prague 1606).

It was the second supernova to be observed in a generation (after [[SN 1572]] seen by [[Tycho Brahe]] in [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]). No further supernovae have since been observed with certainty in the Milky Way, though many others outside our galaxy have been seen since [[S Andromedae]].

Present day astronomical evidence exists for a Milky Way supernova whose signal would have reached earth ca 1680 ([[Cassiopeia A]]), and another object whose light should have arrived ca 1870. However there is no historical record of either having been detected at the time, by the unaided human eye.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web

The [[supernova remnant]] resulting from this supernova is considered to be one of the prototypical objects of its kind, and is still an object of much study in [[astronomy]].
