&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kevin Robert Elz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, often referred to in computing circles as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Robert Elz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or simply &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;kre&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a [[programmer|computer programmer]] and a pioneer in connecting [[Australia]] to the [[Internet]], and more recently, in connecting [[Thailand]].

==Career==
Some of his achievements include developing a number of important Internet [[Request for Comments|RFC]] documents, helping connect Australia to the world-wide Internet, developing the internet-based research network within Australia, and operating the [[.au]] domain registry from 1986 through to the late 1990s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerclarke.com/II/OzI04.html|title=The Internet in Australia}} by Roger Clarke&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He also managed the &amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;aus.*&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt; [[Usenet]] hierarchy from its inception in the 1980s until the mid-1990s.

He is an Honorary [[Fellow]] at the [[University of Melbourne]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.melbourne.edu/studio/ep-31|title=It started with a ping|publisher=University of Melbourne Newsroom|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; where for some years he worked in the [[Computer Science]] department.

Having previously lived and worked in [[Melbourne]] for many years, he currently lives in [[Hat Yai]], [[Songkhla Province|Songkhla]], Thailand,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.coe.psu.ac.th/en/staff_detail.php?staff=17|title=Elz&amp;apos;s staff listing at Thailand&amp;apos;s Centre for Network Research}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; where he is an honorary lecturer in the Computer Engineering Department of the [[Prince of Songkla University]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.coe.psu.ac.th/en/|title=Department of Computer Engineering at the Prince of Songkla University}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Operation of .au==
As the architect of the early domain-name eligibility criteria for &amp;quot;.com.au&amp;quot;, Elz is largely responsible for Australia&amp;apos;s not experiencing a domain name gold rush in the mid-1990s. The eligibility policy required a direct connection between a company&amp;apos;s official name and its domain name, in contrast to the strictly first-come-first-served policy of the [[.com]] registry.

Elz was, however, criticised during his tenure, as domain name applications often took many months to be examined{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, despite the commercialisation of the Internet and customer demands for quick turnaround times{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. He was also responsible for the controversial handing-over of the operation of &amp;quot;.com.au&amp;quot; to [[Melbourne IT]] in 1996.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caslon.com.au/audaprofile2.htm|title=auDA and dot-au: History|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
