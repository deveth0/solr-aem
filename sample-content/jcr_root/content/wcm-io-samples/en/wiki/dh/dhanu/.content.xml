::&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This is an article about the Hindu festival Dhanu.  For information about Dhanu, the assassin of the Prime Minister of India, [[Rajiv Gandhi]], see [[Thenmuli Rajaratnam]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
In the [[Hindu]] religion, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dhanu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which is generally referred to as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dhanu Yatra&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a festival holiday relating to Lord [[Krishna]]&amp;apos;s visit to [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]]. This visit was made to witness the ceremony of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bow&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This event is observed in a colourful festival at [[Bargarh]], [[Odisha]].

During this festival, which runs from 16 December until the beginning of January, Bargarh becomes known as Mathura, the [[Jura river (India)|Jura River]] becomes [[Yamuna]] and the village Amapalli, (which is situated on the other bank of the river), becomes [[Gokul]].

Different acts of [[Puranas|puranic]] descriptions are performed at specific locations and the spectators move from place to place with the action to follow the performance. During this festival the Lord is offered sweetened rice flakes which are specially prepared in a Conical shape.

The festival is also referred to as Dhanu Sankranti.

Dhanu is also name of the month in the Malayalam Calendar, mainly used by people of [[Kerala]] state in [[India]], women celebrate [[Thiruvathira]] in this month. Thiruvathira is supposed to be the birthday of Lord [[Shiva]]. Married women and girls do &amp;apos;upavasa&amp;apos; (fasting) on that day, and sing and dance. Girls pray to Lord Shiva to get a good husband while married women pray for the longevity of their husbands.

In [[Kannada language|Kannada]], &amp;quot;dhanu&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;bow,&amp;quot; and is also the name of the zodiac sign Sagittarius.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
