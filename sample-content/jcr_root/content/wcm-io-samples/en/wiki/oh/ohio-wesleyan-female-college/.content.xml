&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ohio Wesleyan Female College&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was founded in 1853 in [[Delaware, Ohio]]. It is also known under the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wesleyan Female College in Cincinnati&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 1877, the Wesleyan Female College merged with [[Ohio Wesleyan University]].

== History ==

It is [[Timeline of women&amp;apos;s colleges in the United States|one of the oldest institutions of higher education for women]] in the [[United States]], which provided general educational opportunities to women in an era when [[co-educational]] institutions of higher learning were not yet fully open to students of both sexes. In 1855, funds for the school&amp;apos;s first and only institutional building were obtained from [[Mary Monnett Bain|Mary Monnett]], a student who attended the school. The trustees named the main building Monnett Hall in her honor.

The main Wesleyan Female College Hall in Delaware, Ohio was razed in the late 1970s and the site is now occupied by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Monnett Gardens&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Wesleyanâ€™s annual celebration of spring, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Monnett Weekend&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is held each April.
