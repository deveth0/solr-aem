David Gurevich was born as Vyacheslav Gurevich in Kharkov, Ukraine in 1951. His father was an Air Force pilot and his mother a doctor. He was one of a few Jewish students on the Interpreter department of the Moscow Institute of Foreign Languages (now Moscow Linguistic University). Jews were highly unwanted there, because they were considered not &amp;quot;ideologically reliable&amp;quot; enough for communicating with foreigners. But thanks to his outstanding abilities he managed to break through. Nevertheless after the graduation there were practically no possibilities for a Jew to find any rewarding position in the Soviet system, so in 1976 he emigrated to the USA, where he had changed a number of occupations till he found his real vocation as a writer, book and film critic, essayist. In 1987 his first novel, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Travels with Dubinsky and Clive&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was published by [[Viking]]. The memoir &amp;apos;&amp;apos;From Lenin to Lennon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Harcourt Brace]], 1991) and another novel, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vodka for Breakfast&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ([[ENC Press]], 2003) followed.

His articles and book reviews have appeared in various publications, both in the USA and abroad. He wrote on the Russian mafia for [[Details (magazine)]], on Harold Robbinsâ€™ literary heritage for [[The New York Times Book Review]], and on Yevgeny Zamyatin for [[The New Criterion]]. Other publications include [[Wall Street Journal]], [[The Guardian (London)]], [[The Forward]], [[The Boston Globe]], [[The American Spectator]], [[Newsday]], and others. He also reviews film for [[Images Journal]], an online publication.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

David Gurevich was the producer of the film &amp;quot;Empty Rooms&amp;quot; (directed by the outstanding Dutch director [[Willy Lindwer]]) about the [[Dolphinarium massacre]] on June 1, 2002, where twenty-one people died in the suicide bombing committed by Islamic Jihad outside Dolphinarium, a [[Tel Aviv]] disco.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
