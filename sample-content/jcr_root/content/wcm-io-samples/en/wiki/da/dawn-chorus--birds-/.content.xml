        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;dawn chorus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; occurs when [[songbird]]s [[Bird song|sing]] at the start of a new day. In [[temperate countries]], this is most noticeable in spring, when the [[bird]]s are either defending a [[Territory (animal)|breeding territory]] or trying to attract a mate. In a given location, it is common for different species to do their dawn singing at different times. In a study of the [[Ecuador]]an forest, it was determined that birds perching higher in the trees and birds with larger eyes tend to pipe up first.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Jamieson&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Jamieson, Barrie Gillean Molyneux (editor) (2007) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reproductive Biology and Phylogeny of Birds: Sexual selection, behavior, conservation, embryology, genetics&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Part B of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reproductive Biology and Phylogeny of Birds&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) Science Publishers, Enfield, New Hampshire, page 183, ISBN 978-1-57808-386-2&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; These correlations may be caused by the fact that both would also correlate with the amount of [[light]] perceived by the bird.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Jamieson&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Moller used a play-back technique to investigate the effects of singing by the [[Black Wheatear]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;(Oenanthe leucura)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on the behaviour of both [[conspecifics]] and heterospecifics.  It was found that singing increased in both groups in response to the wheateater and Moller suggested the dawn (and dusk) chorus of bird song may be augmented by [[Social facilitation in animals|social facilitation]] due to the singing of conspecifics as well as heterospecifics.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Moller, A.P., (1992). Interspecific response to playback of bird song.  Ethology, 90: 315-320. DOI: 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1992.tb00842.x&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In some territories where bird life is extensive and birds are vocal, the sound of a dawn chorus can render early morning [[sleep]]ing difficult.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Carson, Rachel and Freeman, Dorothy (1995) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Always, Rachel: the letters of Rachel Carson and Dorothy Freeman, 1952-1964&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Beacon Press, Boston, Massachusetts, page 462, ISBN 0-8070-7010-6&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

==International Dawn Chorus Day==

An annual International Dawn Chorus Day is held on the first Sunday in May&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.idcd.info/ IDCD.info]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; where the public are encouraged to rise early to listen to bird song, at organised events. The first ever was held at [[Moseley Bog]] in [[Birmingham]], England in 1984, by the [[Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country|Urban Wildlife Trust]].

==New Zealand==
Early explorers and European settlers noted that the [[New Zealand]] forest had a loud dawn chorus. This is no longer the case due to extensive loss of forests and the introduction of bird predators and competing species such as wasps. The [[New Zealand Bellbird|bellbird]] and the [[Tui (bird)|tui]] are two of the birds that would have formed part of the dawn chorus since they have a vocal and melodious call.
