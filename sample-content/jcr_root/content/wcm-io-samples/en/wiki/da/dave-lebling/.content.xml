&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;P. David Lebling&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born October 30, 1949) is an [[interactive fiction]] [[game designer]] ([[implementer (video games)|implementor]]) and programmer who has worked at various companies, including [[Infocom]] and Avid.

He was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], grew up in [[Maryland]], and attended [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], where he obtained a degree in [[political]] science before becoming a member of its Laboratory for Computer Science.

After encountering the original &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; game (also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Colossal Cave&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), he was fascinated by the concept and—together with [[Marc Blank]], [[Tim Anderson (Zork)|Tim Anderson]] and [[Bruce Daniels]]—set out to write an adventure game with a better [[parser]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lebling |first1=P.D. |last2=Blank |first2=M.S. |first3=T.A.| last3=Anderson |year=1980 |title=Zork:A Computerized Fantasy Simulation Game |journal=IEEE Computer |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=51–59 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |doi=10.1109/MC.1979.1658697 |url=http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MC.1979.1658697  |accessdate=May 27, 2012 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; which became &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Zork]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 1979, he became one of the founders of Infocom.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_55/332-The-Short-Happy-Life-of-Infocom|title=The Short, Happy Life of Infocom|publisher=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|first=Lara|last=Crigger|date=25 July 2006|accessdate=2010-10-28}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

His games include &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Zork]] I,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;II&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;III&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Starcross (video game)|Starcross]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Suspect (computer game)|Suspect]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Spellbreaker]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Lurking Horror]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[James Clavell&amp;apos;s Shogun]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

After Infocom&amp;apos;s end in 1989, Lebling worked on a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] [[spreadsheet]] program, joined [[Avid Technology|Avid]] (a company doing special effects for broadcast and film), and designed server applications at [[Ucentric]].

Lebling currently resides in [[Concord, Massachusetts]] with his wife. He is a programmer for British defense contractor [[BAE Systems]].
