        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;dance card&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;programme du bal&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also known by its [[German language|German-language]] name, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tanzkarte&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is used by a woman to record the names of the gentlemen with whom she intends to dance each successive dance at a formal [[ballroom dancing|ball]].
They appear to have originated in 18th century, but their use first became widespread in 19th century [[Vienna]], especially at the massive balls during [[Fasching]] before [[Lent]].
[[File:Dance card00.jpg|thumb|Dance engagements card for 11 January 1887, showing a list of all the dances for the evening - valse, polka, lancers and quadrille; opposite each dance is a space to record the name of the partner for that dance. After the event the card was probably kept as a souvenir of the evening]]
An actual dance card is typically a booklet with a decorative cover, listing dance titles, [[composers]], and the person with whom the woman intended to dance. Typically, it would have a cover indicating the sponsoring organization of the ball and a decorative cord by which it could be attached to a lady&amp;apos;s wrist or [[ball gown]]. From the 19th century until [[World War I]], dance cards for the elite of [[Austria-Hungary]] were often very elaborate, with some even incorporating [[precious metal]]s and [[Jewellery|jewel]]s.

In modern times the expression &amp;quot;dance card&amp;quot; is often used [[metaphor]]ically, as when someone says &amp;quot;pencil me into your dance card,&amp;quot; meaning &amp;quot;find some time to spend with me&amp;quot;.  Conversely, someone&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;dance card is full&amp;quot; implies that even though they may be interested, they have no time for another person.

[[U.S. Air Force]] [[aircrew]]s in general, and those involved in flight tests in particular, use the term to describe the first card in a &amp;quot;deck&amp;quot; of flight or test maneuver cards. The &amp;quot;dance card&amp;quot; contains administrative data about the mission, aircraft, and aircrew as well as a list of the maneuvers to be flown. The card serves as a table of contents for the mission and a quick reference for the aircrew&amp;apos;s use during the flight.
