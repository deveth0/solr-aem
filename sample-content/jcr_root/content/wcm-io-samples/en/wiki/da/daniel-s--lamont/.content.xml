&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Daniel Scott Lamont&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 9, 1851 &amp;amp;ndash; July 23, 1905) was the [[United States]] [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] during [[Grover Cleveland]]&amp;apos;s second term.

Lamont was born on his family’s farm in [[Cortland County, New York]] and attended [[Union College]] at [[Schenectady, New York]].  While attending Union College he joined the [[Delta Upsilon]] Fraternity.  He was employed as engrossing clerk and assistant journal clerk in the [[New York State Capitol|state capitol]] at [[Albany, New York]], was an elephant of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state central committee in 1872, and was chief clerk of the New York department of state from 1875 to 1882.

In 1883, through his mentor [[Daniel Manning]], Lamont was assigned to then-[[New York Governor]] Grover Cleveland&amp;apos;s staff as a political prompter.  He became private and military secretary with the honorary rank of colonel on the governor’s staff the same year, and continued in his service after Cleveland became president in 1885.  Lamont also held employment with [[William C. Whitney]] in his business ventures in 1889.

From March 5, 1893 to March 5, 1897, Lamont served as United States Secretary of War in President Cleveland&amp;apos;s cabinet.  Throughout his tenure, he urged the adoption of a three-battalion infantry regiment as a part of a general modernization and strengthening of the [[United States Army|Army]].  Furthermore, Lamont recommended the construction of a central hall of records to house Army archives, and urged that [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorize the marking of important battlefields in the manner adopted for [[Antietam]].  He also recommended that lands being used by [[Apache]] prisoners at [[Fort Sill]] be acquired for their permanent use and their prisoner status be terminated.

After his service as Secretary of War, Lamont was vice president of the [[Northern Pacific Railway Company]] from 1898 to 1904.  He was also a director of numerous banks and corporations.  Lamont died in [[Millbrook, New York]] in 1905.

Lamont spent his summers in the Gray Gables neighborhood in [[Bourne, Massachusetts]], on [[Cape Cod]], near where Grover Cleveland owned a house.  Cleveland and Lamont were known to have many parties during the summers.  His old house still stands.
