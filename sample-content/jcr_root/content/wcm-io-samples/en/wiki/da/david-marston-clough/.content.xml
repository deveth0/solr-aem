&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;David Marston Clough&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (December 27, 1846&amp;amp;nbsp;– August 28, 1924) was an American politician. He served in the [[Minnesota State Senate]] from January 1887 to January 1893. He served as the state&amp;apos;s Lieutenant Governor, January 4, 1893 to January 31, 1895. He was the [[List of Governors of Minnesota|13th]] [[Governor of Minnesota]] from January 31, 1895 to January 2, 1899. He was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].

Born in 1846 in [[Lyme, New Hampshire]], the fourth of fourteen children of New England farmers who resettled near the [[Rum River]], David Clough helped his family eke out a scanty living from the land by raising crops and cutting timber. His boyhood experiences would serve him well as both an entrepreneur and public servant in a state where agriculture and lumber dominated the economy.

Clough&amp;apos;s first business venture, a logging operation he founded at 20, lifted him from poverty and launched him on a path toward wealth and political prominence. He moved to [[Minneapolis]] in 1872 and was elected to the city council eleven years later and then to the [[Minnesota Senate]]. From the senate, he advanced to the office of [[Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota|lieutenant governor]] under Republican [[Knute Nelson]], whose election to the [[U.S. Senate]] moved Clough into the governor&amp;apos;s office.

Clough&amp;apos;s first administration was notable for the ratification of significant amendments to the [[Minnesota Constitution|state constitution]], including those establishing the [[Minnesota Board of Pardons]], withdrawing the right of aliens to vote, and authorizing municipalities to frame &amp;quot;home rule&amp;quot; charters. During his second term, narrowly won in 1896, the legislature raised taxes on several private industries and enacted [[Child labor laws in the United States|child-labor laws]].

In 1900 the redoubtable railroad magnate [[James J. Hill]] urged Clough to establish a lumber operation near [[Puget Sound]]. Until his death at age 78, the logger-turned-[[lumber baron]] lived in [[Everett, Washington]], where he championed the interests of the mill owners against their employees&amp;apos; unionization efforts.
