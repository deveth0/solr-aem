&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Datong District&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|t=大同區|hp=Dàtóng Qū|w=Ta-t&amp;apos;ung Chü|l=Great Harmony District|poj=Tāi-tông-khu}}) is a district of [[Taipei|Taipei City]], [[Taiwan]]. It is located between the [[Taipei Metro]] [[Red Line (TRTS)|Red Line]] and eastern shore of the [[Tamsui River]], and between [[Civic Blvd Expressway|Civic Boulevard]] and the [[National Highway No. 1 (Taiwan)|Sun Yat-sen Freeway]]. The southern part of this area was previously the site of [[Dadaocheng]], one of the first settlements in what is now Taipei and for a time the area&amp;apos;s commercial center.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;about&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.taipei.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1104394&amp;amp;ctNode=27831&amp;amp;mp=100002|title=About Datong District|publisher=Taipei City Government|date=2010-01-11|accessdate=2010-07-18}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Overview==
Taipei&amp;apos;s commercial center has since shifted south east to [[Zhongzheng District|Zhongzheng]], [[Da&amp;apos;an District, Taipei|Daan]] and [[Xinyi District|Xinyi]], and Datong is far less important economically. One of the last vestiges of Dadaocheng&amp;apos;s commercial importance disappeared with the closing of the [[Chien-Cheng Circle|Jiancheng Circle market]] in 2006.  The north was the site of the village of [[Dalongdong]].

==History==
During the [[Qing Dynasty]], the district was initially named Balanbong, which was renamed to Dalongtong in 1844. Following the [[Second Opium War]], a port was opened in Dadaocheng for international trade. Foreign trade resulted in the economic development of the district. In 1946, the name was changed again to the current Datong. In 1990, the district merged with neighboring Jiancheng and Yanping Districts to create today&amp;apos;s Datong District.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;about&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; The district is named after the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] notion of utopia.

==Tourism==
It is most notable for its Japanese colonial era and Qing dynasty architecture, especially along [[Dihua Street]] (迪化街). It is also famous for the Dihua (Tihua) Street Market during the [[Chinese New Year|Lunar New Year]] holidays.  The market sells dried fruits, nuts, dried meats, dried seafood, snacks, and health drinks.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;about&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

Other attractions in Datong include the [[Taipei Confucius Temple]] and the [[Dalongdong Baoan Temple|Bao-an Temple]] in the Dalongdong area, and the [[Xiahai City God Temple]] near Dihua Street.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;about&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; Datong also contains the Yongle Market (also on Dihua Street), Ningxia Night Market, Yansan Night Market, and Dalong Night Market.

==Economy==
[[TransAsia Airways]] has its headquarters in Datong District.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;[http://www.tna.com.tw/en/img/foot_01.gif foot_01.gif].&amp;quot; [[TransAsia Airways]].

Retrieved on January 7, 2011. &amp;quot;地址：台北市大同區103鄭州路139號9樓&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Transportation==
Datong is served by the [[Taipei Metro]] [[Red Line (TRTS)|Red Line]] and [[Orange Line (TRTS)|Orange Line]]. It will also be served by the future [[Songshan Line (TRTS)|Songshan Line]].

By road, the district is served by [[National Highway No. 1 (Taiwan)|National Highway No. 1]], [[Provincial Highway No. 1 (Taiwan)|Provincial Highway No. 1]], and [[Provincial Highway No. 2 (Taiwan)|Provincial Highway No. 2]].

It is also the location of the [[Taipei Bus Station]], the largest bus terminal in the city.
