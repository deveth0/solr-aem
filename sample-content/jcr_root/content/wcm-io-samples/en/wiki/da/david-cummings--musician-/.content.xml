&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;David Cummings&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (sometimes credited as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dave Cummings&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a British musician and scriptwriter. He is best known for writing for British television comedies such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Fast Show]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and in the music world for being a guitarist in [[Del Amitri]]&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Buckley2003&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=Peter|title=The rough guide to rock|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=haEfq-nKqjgC&amp;amp;pg=PR7-IA228|accessdate=14 May 2011|date=2003-10-28|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-105-0|pages=7â€“}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; between 1989 and 1995.

In the early 1980s, Cummings studied at the [[University of East Anglia]] in [[Norwich]], where he earned a degree in English &amp;amp; American Studies. It was while studying at the UEA that he met [[Paul Whitehouse]] and [[Charlie Higson]], who later went on to create &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Fast Show&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. At this time, however, Higson was mostly interested in music, and Cummings was a founder member of his band, [[The Higsons]], who gained some cult popularity at the time.

After graduating from University, Cummings moved to [[London]], where he continued playing guitar, notably in the legendary, but unsigned, cult band Bonsai Forest featuring Paul Whitehouse on lead guitar. In 1989 he joined the Scottish group [[Del Amitri]] after the departure of their guitarist Mick Slaven, being pictured on the cover of the 1990 album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Waking Hours]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; even though he joined after the material had already been recorded.

Cummings played on the next two Del Amitri albums, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Change Everything]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1992 and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Twisted (Del Amitri album)|Twisted]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1995, as well as on various tours, including an appearance at [[Woodstock &amp;apos;94]]. However, at the end of their United States tour of 1995, which saw them riding on the crest of a top ten hit there with the song &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Roll to Me&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Cummings decided to leave the band. He thought all the touring might put a strain on his marital life, and his departure is documented - and somewhat dramatised - on the band&amp;apos;s tongue-in-cheek 1996 tour diary [[VHS|video]] release &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Let&amp;apos;s Go Home&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Even before his departure from the band, since 1994 Cummings had begun to move into scriptwriting, working with [[Paul Whitehouse|Whitehouse]] on material for comedian [[Harry Enfield]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Harry Enfield and Chums&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sketch show broadcast on [[BBC One]].

His friendship with Whitehouse and Higson led to Del Amitri appearing in an episode of their [[BBC Two]] sketch show &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Fast Show]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1995, and after his departure from the band Cummings turned full-time to television scriptwriting.

As well as continuing to write for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Fast Show&amp;apos;&amp;apos; until its conclusion in 2000, Cummings co-wrote with Whitehouse the sitcom &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Happiness&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (BBC Two, 2000-01) and the feature film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kevin and Perry Go Large&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was a spin-off from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Harry Enfield and Chums&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. As of July 2004, he continues to work in the television industry on various projects.
