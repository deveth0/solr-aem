Other notable projects included the page &amp;apos;&amp;apos;New Irish Writing&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Irish Press]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which provided a forum for aspiring Irish authors, publishing most of the most important names in Irish fiction, many for the first time, including [[Dermot Bolger]], Ita Daly, [[Anne Enright]], [[Neil Jordan]], [[Claire Keegan]], [[John McGahern]], [[Michael Feeney Callan]], [[Bernard MacLaverty]], [[Eilis Ni Dhuibhne]], [[Joseph O&amp;apos;Connor]], [[Colm Tóibín]] and [[William Wall]]. He was, in the words of Fintan O&amp;apos;Toole &amp;quot;the single most important literary editor in Ireland in the second half of the 20th century&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Fintan O&amp;apos;Toole, Irish Times http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2009/0516/1224246669128.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
