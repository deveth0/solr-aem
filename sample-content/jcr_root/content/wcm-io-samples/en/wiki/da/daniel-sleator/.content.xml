&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Daniel Dominic Kaplan Sleator&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a professor of [[computer science]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. He discovered [[amortized analysis]] and he invented many [[data structures]] with [[Robert Tarjan]], such as [[splay tree]]s, [[link/cut tree]]s, and [[skew heap]]s.  He also pioneered the theory of [[link grammar]]s and developed the technique of [[Competitive analysis (online algorithm)|competitive analysis]] for [[online algorithm]]s.  Because of his contribution in computer science, he won the [[Paris Kanellakis Award]] in 1999.

==Personal life==
Sleator commercialized the volunteer-based [[Internet Chess Server]] into the [[Internet Chess Club]] despite outcry from fellow volunteers.  The ICS has since become one of the most successful internet-based commercial chess servers.

He is the brother of [[William Sleator]], who wrote science fiction for young adults.

Sleator has hosted the progressive talk show &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Left Out&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on [[WRCT|WRCT-FM]] with fellow host and School of Computer Science faculty member [[Robert Harper (computer scientist)|Bob Harper]].
