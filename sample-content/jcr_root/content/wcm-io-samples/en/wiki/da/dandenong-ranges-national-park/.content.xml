&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dandenong Ranges National Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia, 38&amp;amp;nbsp;km east of Melbourne.

Because the park is located in an urban area, the park has a long history of major problems with feral and roaming animals. A [[feral cat|cat]]-[[curfew]] was introduced in the entire [[Dandenong Ranges]] area some years ago, and since then the numbers and variety of [[lyrebird]]s and other native species have climbed dramatically.

Dandenong Ranges National Park is divided into five sections:
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Doongalla Forest&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; – Containing [[Mount Dandenong]] itself, and the [[SkyHigh Mount Dandenong|SkyHigh]] lookout with panoramic views of Melbourne&amp;apos;s east.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ferntree Gully&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; – The south western section of the Dandenong Ranges National Park, located between the suburbs of [[Ferntree Gully]] and [[Boronia, Victoria|Boronia]] to the west, [[Upwey, Victoria|Upwey]] to the south, [[Tremont, Victoria|Tremont]] and [[Sassafras, Victoria|Sassafras]] to the east and [[The Basin, Victoria|The Basin]] to the north. The park contains the Thousands Steps trail leading to One Tree Hill. The very steep walking trail includes over 700 steps over 2.5&amp;amp;nbsp;km and commemorates the battle for the [[Kokoda track]] in [[Territory of Papua]] during [[New Guinea campaign|World War II]]. The steps are a popular destination for sightseers and fitness enthusiasts alike. During the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] pre-season a number of Melbourne [[Australian Rules]] football League and Association teams run their players up the steps to promote team fitness. There is no specific creation date of the steps, however they are believed to be built during the early 1860s when they provided the only means of accessing the One Tree Hill Summit. According to a Tourist Guide published in 1868, all other areas contained thick forest vegetation. A survey of the park found that over 82% of visitors (on weekends) use  the park for fitness-related walking. It is also a popular spot for picnics.

* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sherbrooke Forest]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Olinda Forest&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; occupies the eastern slopes of Mount Dandenong.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mount Evelyn Forest&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the most northerly section of the park.
