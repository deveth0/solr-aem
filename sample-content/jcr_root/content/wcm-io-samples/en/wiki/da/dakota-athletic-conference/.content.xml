The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dakota Athletic Conference&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;DAC&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was a college athletic conference affiliated with the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]].  As the name implies, member teams were located in the states of [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]].  The conference folded in 2012.

==History==
The Dakota Athletic Conference was formed from a merger between the [[North Dakota College Athletic Conference]] and the [[South Dakota Intercollegiate Conference]].  Ten schools were a part of the conference in its history: the [[University of Mary]] joined the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] in 2006, and [[Huron University|Si Tanka-Huron]] closed in 2005. [[Dakota State University]] announced they were leaving the DAC in July 2011 to become an NAIA independent.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsuathletics.com/news/2010/080610-independent.aspx|title=DSU Athletics announces move to independent status|publisher=Dakota State University |accessdate=2011-01-01}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Additionally, member schools [[Minot State]], [[South Dakota School of Mines and Technology]], and [[Black Hills State University]] also left the conference while in the process of transitioning to [[NCAA Division II]].  This left the conference with four schools for 2011-12, after which [[Dickinson State University]] left for the [[Frontier Conference]] and [[Jamestown College]], [[Mayville State University]], and [[Valley City State University]] became [[NAIA independent schools]].

The DAC is one of the only NAIA conferences to have a television contract; [[America One]] owns the broadcast rights to the conference, although most of the games are only carried through the network&amp;apos;s subscription service, B2 Networks.
