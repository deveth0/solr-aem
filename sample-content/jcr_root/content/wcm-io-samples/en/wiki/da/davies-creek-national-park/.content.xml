&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Davies Creek National Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is in [[Far North Queensland]], [[Australia]], 1392&amp;amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Brisbane]], 20&amp;amp;nbsp;km south west of  [[Cairns]].  The park is located on the [[Atherton Tableland]], it is very picturesque with its granite outcrops, the [[Davies Creek Falls]] and an open forest.  Davies Creek raises in the Lamb Range and eventually flows into the [[Barron River (Queensland)|Barron River]]. The park is important as a preserve of the [[Northern Bettong]], an endangered species.

There is a picnic area beside the creek with toilets available, the water of the creek must be boiled for at least five minutes before drinking it. There is a 2&amp;amp;nbsp;km walking trail upstream that leads to the base of Davies Creek Falls.

The park can be reached on the [[Kennedy Highway]] 21&amp;amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Kuranda, Queensland|Kuranda]]. This road is corrugated and unsuitable for caravans.
