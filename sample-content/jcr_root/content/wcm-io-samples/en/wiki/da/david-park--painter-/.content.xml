&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;David Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (March 17, 1911 &amp;amp;ndash; September 20, 1960)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/david-park Art Encyclopaedia]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was a painter and a pioneer of the [[Bay Area Figurative School]] of painting during the 1950s.

==Biography==
David Park was part of the [[post-World War II]] alumni of the [[San Francisco Art Institute]] which was called the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA) at the time.  He revived an interest in figurative art, at first experimenting with still-abstracted forms that relied on color for their impact, dynamics and warmth.  Park, along with [[Richard Diebenkorn]] and  [[Elmer Bischoff]], broke away from the philosophy of painting promoted by [[Clyfford Still]], who taught at the Institute, forming what would later be called the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]]. Their influence may be seen in the work of later Bay Area Figurative School artists such as [[Paul John Wonner]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Manuel Neri]], [[Henry Villierme]] and [[Joan Brown]].

Although these painters started out painting in what was called an objective style, deploying abstract shapes in large space, they soon migrated to using the physical world and representative subjects to  experiment with shape, color, texture and temperature in their painting. Park realized that concentrating on principle and abstraction drew attention to the painter rather than the painting. He felt that it was important to focus on the present, to develop responses to nature.  &amp;quot;I believe that we are living at a time that overemphasizes the need of newness, of furthering concepts&amp;quot;.

David worked with figurative painting from about 1950 until about 1959 when he became ill with cancer. Usually working from memory,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Armstrong 1989, p. 38.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; he initially painted what he saw: kids playing in the street, musicians, his friends, people in their houses. Toward the end of the decade he painted  classical studio nudes and bathers in a monumental style. After he become too ill to work with oils, he continued working with watercolors which he produced until his early death in 1960. David Park died, in 1960, at the age of 49, of cancer. Tragically, he was painting his best works in the final years of his life and career.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-seed/david-park-a-painters-life_b_1299560.html Huffington Post, John Seed, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;David Park, A Painters Life]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He had a retrospective at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in [[New York City]], 1988–1989.
