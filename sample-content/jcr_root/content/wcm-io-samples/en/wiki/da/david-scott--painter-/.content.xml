&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;David Scott&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (October, 1806 &amp;amp;ndash; 5 March 1849) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] historical [[Painting|painter]].

==Life==
The brother of [[William Bell Scott]], he was born at [[Edinburgh]], where he attended the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], and studied art under his father, [[Robert Scott (engraver)|Robert Scott]], the engraver.

In 1828 he exhibited his first oil picture, the &amp;quot;Hopes of Early Genius dispelled by Death,&amp;quot; which was followed by &amp;quot;Cain, Nimrod, Adam and Eve singing their Morning Hymn,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Sarpedon carried by Sleep and Death,&amp;quot; and other subjects of a poetic and imaginative character.

In 1829 he became a member of the Scottish Academy, and in 1832 visited [[Italy]], where he spent more than a year in study. While in [[Rome]] he executed a large symbolical painting, entitled the &amp;quot;Agony of Discord, or the Household Gods Destroyed.&amp;quot; The works of his later years include &amp;quot;[[Vasco da Gama]] encountering the Spirit of the Storm,&amp;quot; a picture immense in size and most powerful in conception finished in 1842, and now preserved in the [[Trinity House, Leith]]; the &amp;quot;Duke of Gloucester entering the Water Gate of Calais&amp;quot; (1841); the &amp;quot;Alchemist&amp;quot; (1818), &amp;quot;Queen Elizabeth at the Globe Theatre&amp;quot; (1840) and &amp;quot;Peter the Hermit&amp;quot; (1845), remarkable for varied and elaborate character painting; and &amp;quot;Ariel and Caliban&amp;quot; (1837) and the &amp;quot;Triumph of Love&amp;quot; (1846), distinguished by beauty of colouring and depth of poetic feeling. The most important of his religious subjects are the &amp;quot;Descent from the Cross&amp;quot; (1835) and the &amp;quot;Crucifixion the Dead Rising&amp;quot; (1844).

Scott also executed several remarkable series of designs. Two of these-the &amp;quot;Monograms of Man&amp;quot; and the illustrations to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner|Ancient Mariner]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were etched by his own hand, and published in 1831 and 1837 respectively, while his subjects from the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pilgrim&amp;apos;s Progress&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and [[John Pringle Nichol|Nichol]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Architecture of the Heavens&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were issued after his death.
