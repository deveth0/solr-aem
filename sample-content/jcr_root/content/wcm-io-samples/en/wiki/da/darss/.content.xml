The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Darß&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the middle part of the peninsula of [[Fischland-Darß-Zingst]] on the southern shore of the [[Baltic Sea]] in the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]]. The peninsula&amp;apos;s name comes from the names of the three regions making up the peninsula. There is a large forest in the Darß. In recent times, the name &amp;quot;Darß&amp;quot; has also been used to refer to the entire peninsula.

The Darß is famous for being a resting place for tens of thousands of migrating [[crane (bird)|crane]]s and [[goose|geese]]. Tourism has long been a source of income and has increased since [[German reunification]], but the Darß is still far from being a crowded tourist place.

== Location and character ==

The Darß lies northeast of [[Fischland]] and west of the peninsula of [[Zingst]], its boundary with the latter being formed by the inlet of the [[Prerower Strom]]. To the north lies the [[Baltic Sea]]; to the south the lagoons of [[Saaler Bodden]] and [[Bodstedter Bodden]], which belong to  the [[Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain]]. The Darß measures between ten and twelve kilometres from north to south and from east to west and is home to the villages of [[Born a. Darß]], [[Prerow]] and [[Wieck a. Darß|Wieck]]. The village of Ahrenshoop in the municipality of [[Ahrenshoop]] belongs to Vordarß, whilst the southern villages in Ahrenshoop, [[Althagen]] and [[Niehagen]], are part of Fischland.

Most of the Darß is covered by the woodland of the [[Darß Forest]], 5,800&amp;amp;nbsp;hectares in area. On the northern tip of the Darß, at [[Darßer Ort]], is a [[lighthouse]] of the same name. The National Park exhibition in Wieck a. Darß provides information about the geological development as well as the flora and fauna of the [[Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park]], as does the  [[Darßer Ort Natureum|Natureum]] in Wieck a. Darß attached to the [[Darßer Ort Lighthouse]], as outstations of the [[German Maritime Museum]] in [[Stralsund]]. Darßer Ort is an extended chain of sandbanks running in a northeasterly direction. The entire area around Darßer Ort as well as the northwestern part of the Darß Forest is part of Protection Zone I of  the National Park and may only be visited on marked paths. The rest of the forested region is also part of the National Park.
