        text="&lt;p&gt;In [[Greek mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Daedalion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a son of [[Hesperos]] and brother of [[Ceyx]]. He is described as a cruel and warlike man.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/notes/met/PART75.html Metamorphoses Book Notes Summary by Ovid: Book 11: Daedalion&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; His daughter [[Chione (daughter of Daedalion)|Chione]] was so beautiful that both Apollo and Hermes impregnated her. She then became vain and boasted that she was more beautiful than Artemis. When Artemis killed her in revenge, Daedalion was so grief-stricken that he threw himself off a cliff at [[Mt. Parnassos]], and [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]] turned him into a hawk ([[Ovid]] XI, 291).
