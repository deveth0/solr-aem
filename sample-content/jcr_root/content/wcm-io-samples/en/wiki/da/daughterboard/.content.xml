A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;daughterboard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;daughtercard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;mezzanine board&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;piggyback board&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[circuit board]] meant to be an extension or &amp;quot;daughter&amp;quot; of a [[motherboard]] (or &amp;apos;mainboard&amp;apos;), or occasionally of another card.  In particular, daughterboards often have [[plugs (connector)|plugs]], [[Jack (connector)|sockets]], [[pins]], [[electrical connector|connectors]], or other attachments for other boards, which is what differentiates them from standard expansion boards such as for [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] or [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]], which are usually called [[expansion card]]s.  In addition, daughterboards usually have only internal [[Electrical connector|connections]] within a [[computer]] or other [[electronics|electronic]] [[machine|device]] rather than any external ones, and usually access the motherboard directly rather than through a [[computer bus]].

Daughterboards are sometimes used in computers in order to allow for expansion cards to fit on their side (or upright), [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the motherboard, usually to maintain a small or slim [[Computer form factor|form factor]]. In this case they can also be called [[riser card]]s, or risers. Daughterboards are also sometimes used to expand the basic functionality of an electronic device, such as when a certain model has features added to it and is released as a new or separate model.  Rather than redesign the first model completely, a daughterboard may be added to a special [[Computer port (hardware)|port]] or connector on the motherboard or mainboard.  These usually fit on top of and parallel to the board, separated by [[spacer]]s or [[Standoff (separator)|standoff]]s, and are therefore sometimes called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;mezzanine cards&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; due to being stacked like the [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] of a [[theatre]]. [[Wavetable]] cards are often [[wikt:mount|mounted]] on [[sound card]]s in this manner.
