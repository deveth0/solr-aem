She died in Paris.

==Parents and childhood==
She was born in Paris the only daughter of [[Isabelle-Blanche Singer]] (1869–1896) and [[Jean, duc Decazes|Jean Élie Octave Louis Sévère Amanieu Decazes]] (1864–1912), the 3rd Duke Decazes and Glücksberg. Her maternal grandfather was [[Isaac Merritt Singer]], the American sewing-machine pioneer. After her mother&amp;apos;s death, she and her siblings were largely raised by their aunt [[Winnaretta Singer]], [[Princess Edmond de Polignac]], a noted patron of the arts, particularly music.

==First marriage==
Her first husband, whom she married 10 May 1910 in Paris, was Jean Amédée Marie Anatole, [[House of Broglie|Prince of Broglie]] (born in Paris on 27 January 1886) He died of influenza on 20 February 1918 while serving with the [[French Army]] in [[Mascara, Algeria]], though malicious observers gossiped that he actually committed suicide as a result of his [[outing|homosexuality having been exposed]].

They had three daughters:

* Princess [[Emmeline Isabelle Edmée Séverine]] ([[Neuilly]], 16 Feb 1911 - Onez, Switzerland, 10 Sep 1986). Married to Marie Alexandre William Alvar Biaudos Comte de Castéja (Paris, 6 Apr 1907 - Paris, 6 July 1983) in Neuilly, 8 Nov 1932.

* Princess [[Isabelle Marguerite Jeanne Pauline]] ([[Lamorlaye]], 27 Jul 1912 - [[Geneva]], 18 Jul 1960). Married to Olivier Charles Humbert Marie, [[Marquis de La Moussaye]] (La Poterie, 26 Mars 1908 - Paris, 20 October 1988) in Neuilly, 3 Jun 1931. Divorced in Paris, 13 April 1945.

* Princess [[Jacqueline Marguerite]] (Paris, 5 January 1918 - [[Crans-Montana]], [[Valais]] 26 February 1965). Married to Alfred Ignaz Maria Kraus ([[Sarajevo]], 28 November 1908-) in Neuilly 6 October 1941. Divorced in [[Münster]] 3 February 1958.

Of her Broglie children, the notoriously caustic Daisy once said, &amp;quot;The eldest is like her father, only more masculine. The second is like me, only without the guts. And the last is by some horrible little man called Lischmann.&amp;quot;{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Second marriage==
Her second husband, whom she married on August 9, 1919 in London, was the Hon. [[Reginald Ailwyn Fellowes]] (1884–1953). He was a banker cousin of [[Winston Churchill]] and the son of [[William Fellowes, 2nd Baron de Ramsey]]. They had one child, [[Rosamond Daisy Fellowes]] (1921–1998).

==Affairs==
Among her lovers was [[Duff Cooper]], the British ambassador to France.

==Literary works==
Fellowes wrote several novels and at least one epic poem. Her best-known work is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Les dimanches de la comtesse de Narbonne&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1931, published in English as &amp;quot;Sundays&amp;quot;). She also wrote the novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cats in the Isle of Man&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Status as fashion icon==
She was known as one of the most daring [[fashion plate]]s of the 20th century, arguably the most important patron of the surrealist couturier [[Elsa Schiaparelli]]. She was also a friend of the jeweller [[Suzanne Belperron]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last1=Raulet|first1=Sylvie |last2=Baroin |first2=Olivier|title=Suzanne Belperron|pages=351|publisher=Antique Collectors Club|date=December 16, 2011|isbn=978-1-85149-625-9}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
