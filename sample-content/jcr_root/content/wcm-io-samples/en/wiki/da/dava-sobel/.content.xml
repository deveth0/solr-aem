She graduated from [[The Bronx High School of Science]] and [[Binghamton University]]. Her works include:

* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Longitude (book)|Longitude]]: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1995) – the genius in question was [[John Harrison]], who spent decades trying to convince the [[British Admiralty]] of the accuracy of his naval timepieces and their use in determining [[longitude]] when at sea in order to win the [[longitude prize]]. ISBN 1-85702-571-7. The book itself won the 1997 [[British Book of the Year]] award.

[[Michael Gambon]] played John Harrison, and [[Jeremy Irons]] played [[Rupert Gould]], who restored Harrison&amp;apos;s timepieces for posterity in the mid-20th century.

&amp;lt;!-- To do: include literary criticism of her works. What is the consensus? Is her scholarship accurate? Does she shed new light on, for example, the Galileo controversy? --&amp;gt;
Sobel made her first foray into teaching at the [[University of Chicago]] as the Vare Writer-in-Residence in the winter of 2006. She taught a one-quarter seminar on writing about science.

She served as a judge for the [[PEN/E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award]] in 2012.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pen.org/blog/announcing-2012-pen-literary-awards-recipients |title=Announcing the 2012 PEN Literary Award Recipients |date=October 15, 2012 |accessdate=February 6, 2013 |work=[[PEN American Center]]}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

She holds [[Doctor of Humane Letters|honorary doctor of letters]] degrees from the [[University of Bath]], and [[Middlebury College]], Vermont, both awarded in 2002.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Dava Sobel Biography|url=http://www.davasobel.com/about_bio.php}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The [[asteroid]] [[30935 Davasobel]] is named after her.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=30935+Davasobel &amp;quot;30935 Davasobel&amp;quot;], [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] Small-Body Database Browser&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Sobel states she is a chaser of [[solar eclipse]]s and that &amp;quot;it&amp;apos;s the closest thing to witnessing a miracle&amp;quot;. As of August 2012 she has seen eight, and planned to see the [[Solar eclipse of November 13, 2012|November 2012 total solar eclipse]] in Australia.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Byrne Presents: Dava Sobel|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/firsttuesday/s3576835.htm#transcript|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
