&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;David Adler&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (January 3, 1882 â€“ September 27, 1949) was a prolific [[architecture|architect]], designing over 200 buildings. He was the son of Therese and [[Issac Adler]] and had one sister, [[Frances Adler Elkins]], who became one of the mid 20th-century&amp;apos;s great interior decorators and often worked with her brother on residential projects.

Adler was born in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].  After graduating from [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in 1904, he travelled extensively, mostly studying and observing the architecture of [[Europe]]. After returning to the [[United States]] in 1911, he began working for [[Howard Van Doren Shaw]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. After a short period, he opened a new office with a friend from [[Paris]], [[Henry Dangler]]. David married Katherine Keith, an Illinois socialite and writer, in 1916 and they moved to Libertyville one year later. He became a widower in 1930 after his wife was killed in a car accident in Europe.

Working in association with his partners, first Henry Dangler who died in 1917, and then Robert Work, Adler was not registered as an architect in [[Illinois]] until 1929, which was after he had already been elected to the American Institute of Architects.  He died, aged 67, in [[Libertyville, Illinois]].
