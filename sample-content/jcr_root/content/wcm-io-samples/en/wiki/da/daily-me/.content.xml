The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Daily Me&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a term popularized by [[MIT Media Lab]] founder [[Nicholas Negroponte]] to describe a virtual daily newspaper customized for an individual&amp;apos;s tastes. Negroponte discusses it in his 1995 book, [[Being Digital]], referencing a project under way at the media lab, Fishwrap. Designed by [[Pascal Chesnais]] and Walter Bender and implemented by media lab students, the system allowed a greater deal of customization than commercially available systems in 1997.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal | title = The Daily Me | first = Christopher | last = Harper | work = [[American Journalism Review]] | url = http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=268 | month = April | year = 1997}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Fred Hapgood]], in a 1995 article in [[Wired magazine|Wired]] credited the concept and phrase to Negroponte&amp;apos;s thinking in the 1970s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.11/media.html | title = The Media Lab at 10 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | first = Fred | last = Hapgood | issue = 3.11 | month = November | year = 1995}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 2005, Eduardo Hauser, a Venezuelan entrepreneur based in Florida, founded DailyMe, Inc., and developed a proprietary, patent-pending application to create personalized newspapers and have them automatically delivered to each user&amp;apos;s printer, fax machine, or computer.

In [[Steven Berlin Johnson|Steven Johnson]]&amp;apos;s book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Emergence&amp;apos;&amp;apos; concerning [[emergent properties]], Johnson addresses some of Negroponte&amp;apos;s fears with homeostasis and feedback systems in mind.  He argues that a newspaper tailored to the tastes of a person on a given day will lead to too much [[positive feedback]] in that direction, and people&amp;apos;s choices for one day would permanently affect their viewings for the rest of their lives. Since the book&amp;apos;s release, in 2001, many customer-oriented websites, such as [[Amazon.com]] and [[Half.com]], regularly utilize a customer&amp;apos;s past views and purchases to determine what merchandise they believe will entice the customer&amp;apos;s interest.

The term has also been associated with the phenomenon of individuals customizing and personalizing their news feeds, resulting in their being  exposed only to content they are already inclined to agree with. The Daily Me can thus be a critical component of the [[Echo chamber (media)|&amp;quot;echo chamber&amp;quot; effect]], defined in an article in [[Salon.com|Salon]] by [[David Weinberger]] as &amp;quot;those Internet spaces where like-minded people listen only to those people who already agree with them.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2004/02/20/echo_chamber/ | title = Is there an echo in here? | first = David | last = Weinberger | work = [[Salon.com]] | date = 20 February 2004}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Cass Sunstein]], a law professor at the [[University of Chicago]], analyzes the implications of the Daily Me in his book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Republic.com&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Daily me and [[Echo chamber (media)|echo chambers]] have been suggested as one of the extremes of society induced by technology, the other being [[Tyranny of the majority]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal | title = Trust metrics on controversial users: balancing between tyranny of the majority and echo chambers | first1 = Paolo | last1 = Massa | first2 = Paolo | last2 = Avesani | issue = Special Issue on Semantics of People and Culture | journal = International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems (IJSWIS) | year = 2007 | url = http://www.gnuband.org/papers/trust_metrics_on_controversial_users_balancing_between_tyranny_of_the_majority_and_echo_chambers-2/}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Zite.com is a more recent implementation of a concept based on the Daily Me for iPad and Android, and FeedSavvy.com recently launched for PC and Mac users.
