&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Daklon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  (born Yosef Levy) is [[Israel]]i musician.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Horowitz2010&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Horowitz|first=Amy|title=Mediterranean Israeli Music and the Politics of the Aesthetic|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oDO9S_YJMusC&amp;amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=10 May 2011|date=2010-04-15|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0-8143-3465-2|pages=63–}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Early life==
He was born in 1944 in [[Tel Aviv]]&amp;apos;s [[Kerem Hateimanim]] ([[Yemenite Jew|Yemenite]]) neighborhood, as a son of Jewish-Yemeni immigrants from the Shar&amp;apos;ab region in Yemen.

As Daklon explains the source of his nickname: &amp;quot;In those days everyone in the Kerem had a nickname. Your given name was only good for your ID. As a kid I was very small and thin, almost skinny (Hebrew: דק, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;dak&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;daq&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). Therefore they called me &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Daklon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;quot;

He started his musical career as an 11-year-old when his teacher sent him to do a spot for a religious music radio show.

==Music==
Daklon was first inspired to take his music more seriously by [[Morocco]]-born singer Joe Amar at the end of the 1950s. Daklon took [[Greece|Greek]] and [[India]]n songs and put Hebrew words to them in the 1960s when his career was launched. He is famed for his performances with Yemenite virtuosos [[Haim Moshe]] and [[Avihu Medina]].

Daklon songs are usually themed on his love for the [[land of Israel]] and the [[Tetragrammaton|God of Israel]]. Daklon&amp;apos;s music draws on centuries of Hebrew poetry and musical traditions of the [[Yemenite Jews]].
