        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;data haven&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, like a [[corporate haven]] or [[tax haven]], is a [[Safety|refuge]] for uninterrupted or unregulated [[data]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2010/06/icelands_media_law | work=The Economist | title=The Switzerland of bits | date=June 17, 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/02/iceland-aims-to-become-an-offshore-haven-for-journalists-and-leakers/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.theopenhouseproject.com/2010/01/08/a-switzerland-of-bits/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Data havens are locations with [[law|legal environment]]s that are friendly to the concept of a [[computer network]] freely holding data and even protecting its content and associated information. They tend to fit into three categories: a physical [[nation|locality]] with weak information-system enforcement and [[extradition]] laws, a physical locality with intentionally strong protections of data, and [[Virtuality|virtual]] domains designed to secure data via technical means (such as [[encryption]]) regardless of any legal environment.

[[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]&amp;apos;s [[.onion|onion space]] (hidden service), [[HavenCo]] (centralized), and [[Freenet]] (decentralized) are three models of modern-day virtual data havens.

==Purposes of data havens==
Reasons for establishing data havens include access to [[Freedom of speech|free political speech]] for users in countries where [[Internet censorship|censorship]] of the [[Internet]] is practiced.

Other reasons can include:
* [[Whistleblower|Whistleblowing]]
* Distributing [[software]], data or speech that violates laws such as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]]
* [[Copyright infringement]]
* Circumventing [[data protection]] laws
* [[Online gambling]]
* [[Pornography]]

==History of the term==
The 1978 report of the British government&amp;apos;s Data Protection Committee expressed concern that different privacy standards in different countries would lead to the transfer of personal data to countries with weaker protections; it feared that Britain might become a &amp;quot;data haven.&amp;quot;  &amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;NewSci1978&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news|last=Michael|first=James|title=New Report on Computer Data Banks|work=[[New Scientist]]|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tTs5-WSNM6AC&amp;amp;lpg=PA432&amp;amp;pg=PA432#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false|date=November 9, 1978|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Also in 1978, Adrian Norman published a mock consulting study on the feasibility of setting up a company providing a wide range of data haven services, called &amp;quot;[http://www.adminet.co.uk/clients/ANAAL/goldfish.pdf Project Goldfish].&amp;quot;

Science fiction novelist [[William Gibson]] used the term in his novels &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Count Zero]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as did Bruce Sterling in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Islands in the Net]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The &amp;quot;modern-day&amp;quot; segments of [[Neal Stephenson]]&amp;apos;s 1999 novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Cryptonomicon]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; concern a small group of entrepreneurs attempting to create a data haven.
