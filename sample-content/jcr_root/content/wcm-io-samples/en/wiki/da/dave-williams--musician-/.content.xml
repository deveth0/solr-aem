&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;David Winston Williams&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 29, 1972 &amp;amp;ndash; August 14, 2002)&amp;lt;ref name=WHFS&amp;gt;{{cite news |title=To Celebrate the 40th Birthday of Former Drowning Pool Lead Singer Dave Williams…We Give You the Bird |date=February 29, 2012 |url=http://whfs.cbslocal.com/2012/02/29/to-celebrate-the-40th-birthday-of-former-drowning-pool-lead-singer-dave-williams-we-give-you-the-bird/ }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was an American vocalist best known to be the lead singer for the band [[Drowning Pool]].

He grew up in [[Princeton, Texas]] living with his parents Charles Edward and Jo-Ann Williams. During the 1990s he was a fixture in the [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] music scene, often playing in well-known clubs.

In 1999, he joined Drowning Pool. The band released their debut album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sinner (Drowning Pool album)|Sinner]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; with his vocals in 2001. His nickname &amp;quot;Stage&amp;quot; came from [[Pantera]] guitarist [[Dimebag Darrell]] who gave it to him because of his known stage personality during performances. Williams has been ranked in Top 100 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Heavy metal music|metal]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; vocalists of all time by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hit Parader]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; at #82.

==Personality==
A statement from his band mates during his funeral states that he was a gentle man who always made a point to give at least one person &amp;quot;The Gift&amp;quot;. It is not known what this gift actually was, though it was said to be large enough to &amp;quot;fit into a cigar box&amp;quot;{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. He was also known to be very friendly, especially to his fans.

He was a fan of several heavy metal bands, including the group [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Death==
On August 14, 2002, Williams was found dead in the band&amp;apos;s tour bus in Manassas, Virginia.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |date=August 14, 2002 |title=Drowning Pool Singer Found Dead |author=Joe D&amp;apos;Angelo |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457028/drowning-pool-singer-dead.jhtml}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The 30-year-old singer died from [[cardiomyopathy]], a disease of the heart.&amp;lt;ref name=WHFS /&amp;gt;

==Aftermath==
A public funeral was held in [[Plano, Texas]], on August 18, 2002 at 10:00 am.

A DVD called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sinema&amp;apos;&amp;apos; chronicling his life has since been released. His lifelong dream was to buy his parents a house. The sales from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sinema&amp;apos;&amp;apos; fulfilled his dream posthumously.

The Dallas, Texas music community honored Dave and his legacy with a multi-venue music festival aptly named &amp;quot;Stage Fest.&amp;quot; Stage Fest was held in downtown Dallas&amp;apos; [[Deep Ellum, Dallas, Texas|Deep Ellum]] district on August 14, 2007, the fifth anniversary of his death, and played in seven Deep Ellum venues including Club Dada, The Curtain Club, The Lizard Lounge, The Darkside Lounge, Red Blood Club, Reno&amp;apos;s Chop Shop, and Tomcat&amp;apos;s.

Dave&amp;apos;s microphone was given to [[Cristian Machado]] from [[Ill Niño]]. The band [[Memento (band)|Memento]] dedicated their set to Dave on the [[Ozzfest]] 2003 stage.
