&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Darren Thomas Praznik&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born May 9, 1961) is a politician in [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]].  He was a prominent cabinet minister in the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba|Progressive Conservative]] government of [[Gary Filmon]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.gov.mb.ca/legislature/members/bios_living.html#p Manitoba Legislature biographies]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and considered running for the party&amp;apos;s leadership in 2000.

Praznik was born in [[Selkirk, Manitoba|Selkirk]], [[Manitoba]], and attended the [[University of Winnipeg]] and the [[University of Manitoba]].  He was called to the Manitoba bar in 1986, and worked as a barrister and solicitor. He also joined the Board of Directors on the Manitoba Oil and Gas Corporation (for one term), and was a special assistant to the federal Health minister between 1986 and 1988.

Praznik first ran for the [[Legislative Assembly of Manitoba]] in the [[Manitoba general election, 1986|1986 general election]], in the rural northeastern riding of [[Lac du Bonnet (Manitoba riding)|Lac du Bonnet]].  He was defeated by [[Clarence Baker]] of the [[New Democratic Party of Manitoba|New Democratic Party]], 3903 votes to 3601.

Praznik was elected for Lac du Bonnet in the [[Manitoba general election, 1988|1988 general election]] (defeating Baker by over 800 votes), and was soon named legislative assistant to [[Gary Filmon]], the newly-elected [[Premier]].

Praznik was re-elected in the [[Manitoba general election, 1990|1990 election]] and was promoted to [[Manitoba Minister of Labour|Minister of Labour]], a position that he held until 1995.  He held several other portfolios in the Filmon government, including [[Manitoba Minister of Northern Affairs|Minister of Northern Affairs]] (1993–1997), [[Manitoba Minister of Energy and Mines|Minister of Energy and Mines]] (1995–1997), [[Manitoba Minister of Health|Minister of Health]] (1997–1999), and [[Manitoba Minister of Highways and Transportation|Minister of Highways and Transportation]] and Government House Leader (February to October 1999).  As Health Minister, Praznik presided over a number of cutbacks in government funding, but was also responsible for expanding the government&amp;apos;s home care delivery system.

Filmon&amp;apos;s Tories were defeated by [[Gary Doer]]&amp;apos;s [[New Democratic Party of Manitoba|New Democrats]] in the [[Manitoba general election, 1999|1999 election]], and Praznik moved into the opposition.  He considered running against [[Stuart Murray]] for the party&amp;apos;s leadership in 2000, but left the race well before the convention took place.  Murray was subsequently elected without opposition.

Praznik resigned from the legislature in 2002 to become executive director of government relations with the [[Canadian Blood Services]].
