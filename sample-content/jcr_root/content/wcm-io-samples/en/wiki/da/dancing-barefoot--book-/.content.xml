&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dancing Barefoot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a book of memoirs written by [[writer]] and [[actor]] [[Wil Wheaton]], and illustrated by [[illustrator]] [[Ben Claassen III]].
In Spring of 2003 Wheaton founded the independent publishing company [[Monolith Press]], and released the book (ISBN 0-9741160-0-9). Most of the entries are extended versions of his online [[weblog]] entries at his website, [[Wil Wheaton Dot Net]].

Wheaton sold out three printings in four months, and in Winter 2003, the book&amp;apos;s success caught the eye of publisher [[Tim O&amp;apos;Reilly]], who signed Wheaton to a three book contract. [[O&amp;apos;Reilly Media]] acquired &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dancing Barefoot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and released Wheaton&amp;apos;s extended memoirs, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Just a Geek]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in Spring of 2004.

O&amp;apos;Reilly&amp;apos;s website describes Wheaton&amp;apos;s book thus:

{{quote|Wil Wheaton&amp;amp;mdash;blogger, geek, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Star Trek: The Next Generation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/nowiki&amp;gt;s Wesley Crusher&amp;amp;mdash;gives us five short-but-true tales of life in the so-called Space Age in Dancing Barefoot. With a true geek&amp;apos;s unflinching honesty, Wil examines life, love, the web, and the absurdities of Hollywood in these compelling autobiographical narratives. Based on pieces first published in Wil&amp;apos;s hugely popular blog, www.wilwheaton.net, the stories in Dancing Barefoot chronicle a teen TV star&amp;apos;s journey to maturity and self-acceptance. Far from the usual celebrity tell-all, Dancing Barefoot is a vivid account of one man&amp;apos;s version of that universal story, the search for self. If you&amp;apos;ve ever fallen in love, wondered what goes on behind the scenes at a Star Trek convention, or thought hard about the meaning of life, you&amp;apos;ll find a kindred soul in the pages of Dancing Barefoot. In the process of uncovering his true geeky self, Wil Wheaton speaks to the inner geek in all of us.}}

The title of the book is taken from a [[Dancing Barefoot|song of the same name]] written and recorded by [[Patti Smith]]. The song appears on the 1979 Patti Smith Group album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wave (Patti Smith Group album)|Wave]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
