==History of two Date Cities==
In the [[Edo period]], the [[Date clan]] ruled the whole [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]] and the South of [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]]. The Date clan was one of the most influential [[daimyo]]s, samurai. In the [[Meiji period]], many samurai lost their territories because of the [[Meiji Restoration]]. This was also true for the Date clan. A party led by [[Watari, Miyagi|Watari]]-Date, a branch family of the Date clan, settled in uncultivated Hokkaido. This is the origin of Date in Hokkaido. On the other hand, the name of Date clan originated from the name of Date District in Fukushima.

The Date clan rose in Date District in 12th Century. Date in Fukushima is the ancestral ground of Date clan. Date in Hokkaido is the ground of a descendant of Date clan. The two cities have an indirect relation.

The Date family, descendants of [[Fujiwara no Uona]] (721-783) received the Date District in 1189 from the Shôgun [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]].

Before the Edo period, the home castle of Date clan was Yanagawa castle in Yanagawa in Date District. In the Edo period, the home castle was Sendai castle in [[Sendai]], Miyagi.

== Economy ==
