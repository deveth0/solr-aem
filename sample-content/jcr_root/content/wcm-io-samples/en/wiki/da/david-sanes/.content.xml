        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;David Sanes Rodríguez&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1954-19 April 1999) was a native of [[Vieques, Puerto Rico]] whose death became a rallying point for those opposed to the U.S. military presence on and use of his home island for live-fire bombing practice. Sanes Rodríguez&amp;apos;s death sparked the organization of the [[Cause for Vieques]] and a series of [[Navy-Vieques protests|protests by residents and activists]] that culminated in the [[US Navy]] abandoning Vieques.

==Biography==

Sanes Rodríguez was a civilian employee of the [[United States Navy]], working as a security guard at the Navy&amp;apos;s Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility on Vieques. Sanes Rodríguez was killed when two errant 500&amp;amp;nbsp;lb [[Mk 82]] bombs from a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18C Hornet]] fighter landed 100 yards from an observation post in which Sanes Rodríguez was working. Known amongst his friends for his happy-go-lucky, partying lifestyle, in death, Sanes Rodríguez became a household name in [[Puerto Rico]]. His [[funeral]] received widespread media coverage, including U.S. newspapers and international [[television]] networks.
