&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Daniel Lytle Dolan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born May 28, 1951) is a [[sedevacantism|sedevacantist]] [[Traditionalist Catholic]] bishop.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=N_MNAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=t3gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=6409,2063043&amp;amp;dq=daniel-dolan+bishop&amp;amp;hl=en|title=Some Catholics hold fast to tradition|date=27 December 2003|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|page=8|accessdate=February 26, 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

A [[Detroit, Michigan]] native, Dolan began his preparation for the priesthood in 1965 at the archdiocesan minor seminary in Detroit. He continued his studies in the [[Cistercian Order]] and at the seminary of the [[Society of Saint Pius X]] in [[Écône]], [[Switzerland]], where he was ordained a priest by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre on June 29, 1976. As a seminarian at [[Écône]] in autumn 1973, he came to the conclusion that &amp;quot;the only logical explanation&amp;quot; for the New Mass and the alleged heresy of the [[Second Vatican Council]] was that [[Pope Paul VI]] had lost the Roman pontificate. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Since then he has held the position of [[sedevacantism]] regarding Paul VI and his successors. In early 1977, Dolan returned to the [[United States]] where he would establish more than 35 traditionalist Mass centers. In early 1983, [[Marcel Lefebvre|Archbishop Lefebvre]] directed the SSPX&amp;apos;s American priests to follow the [[Roman Missal|liturgical books]] of 1962. Lefebvre insisted that priests publicly affirm their allegiance to [[Pope John Paul II]], which the [[sedevacantism|sedevacantists]] among them, including nine American priests, including Dolan, refused. They were promptly expelled from the SSPX. These priests formed the [[Society of St. Pius V]]. Dolan continued his work at his principal church in [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|West Chester, Ohio]]. In 1989, Dolan initiated contacts with the [[Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen]]. Subsequent discussions revealed agreement on major theological issues. On November 30, 1993, [[Mark Pivarunas|Bishop Mark Pivarunas]], a [[Archbishop Thuc|Thục-line bishop]] of the [[Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen]], consecrated Father Dolan as bishop. Dolan serves [http://www.sgg.org Saint Gertrude the Great Roman Catholic Church] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], as well as in [[sedevacantist]] communities in the [[United States]], [[Mexico]] and [[Europe]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}
