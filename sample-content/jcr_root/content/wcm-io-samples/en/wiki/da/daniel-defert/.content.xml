&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Daniel Defert&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born  September 10, 1937) is a prominent French [[AIDS]] activist and the founding president (1984-1991) of the first AIDS awareness organization in France, [[AIDES]]. He started the organization after the death of his partner, the French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]]. He is an alumnus of the [[École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud]].

A professor of sociology, Daniel Defert has been Assistant (1969-1970), Maître-assistant (1971-1985), then Maître de Conférence (from 1985) at the Centre Universitaire of Vincennes, which became in 1972, Université de Paris VIII Vincennes. He has been a member of the scientific committee for human sciences of the International Conference on AIDS (1986-94); member of the World Commission for AIDS ([[World Health Organization]]) (1988-93); member of the National Committee for AIDS (1989-98), of the Global AIDS Policy Coalition of [[Harvard University]] (1994-1997), and of the French &amp;quot;Haut Comité de la Santé Publique&amp;quot; (from 1998).

Daniel Defert is author of numerous articles in the domain of [[ethno-iconography]] and [[public health]]. He has been awarded the decoration of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chevalier de la [[Légion d’Honneur]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and received in 1998 the [[Prix Alexander Onassis]] for the creation of Aides.

==Life with Foucault==
Daniel Defert met Foucault while he was a philosophy student at the [[University of Clermont-Ferrand]] in France and their relationship lasted from 1963 until Foucault&amp;apos;s death in 1984. They described their relationship as a &amp;quot;state of passion&amp;quot;. It was Foucault&amp;apos;s death from AIDS, a disease about which little was known at the time, that led Defert to enter the field of AIDS activism. He also co-edited with [[François Ewald]] volume 4 of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dits et Ecrits&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of Michel Foucault (1994), a posthumous collection of Foucault&amp;apos;s thought.
