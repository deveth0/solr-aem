&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Darwin Harbour&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the body of water close to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in the [[Australia]]n [[Northern Territory]]. It opens to the north at a line from Charles Point in the west to Lee Point in the east into the [[Beagle Gulf]] and connects via the [[Clarence Strait]] with the [[Van Diemen Gulf]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;SBF&amp;quot;&amp;gt;N Smit, R Billyard and L Ferns: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://www.nretas.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/11107/beagle_intro.pdf Beagle Gulf Benthic Survey: Characterisation of soft substrates.]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Technical Report No. 66 (2000), Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It contains [[Port Darwin]], which is flanked by Frances Bay to the east and Cullen Bay to the west.

== Name ==

It was named after the naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] who sailed with [[Robert Fitzroy]] on the ship [[HMS Beagle|HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Beagle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] around parts of Australia. However, Darwin and Fitzroy sailed in 1836 from [[King George&amp;apos;s Sound]] ([[Western Australia]]) directly to the [[Cocos-Keeling Islands]], at the south coast of [[Java]], and from there to [[Capetown]] and back to [[England]]. They stayed thus away from Darwin Harbour by 3000 sea miles and did not know of its existence.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Alan Powell:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=118146966172132;res=IELHSS Who Named Beagle Gulf?: A Cautionary Tale]. Journal of Northern Territory History, No. 22, 2011: 104-108. ISSN: 1034-7488. Cited on 29 Oct 2012.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Climate ==

The climate of the Darwin Harbour region is monsoon tropical with two distinct seasons: the Dry and the Wet. The Dry lasts for 6 months between April and September with an average rainfall of 24&amp;amp;nbsp;mm, whereas the Wet lasts between October and March with an average monthly rainfall of 254&amp;amp;nbsp;mm/month (according to the Bureau of Meteorology, 1999). The majority of the rain falls between December and April. Runoff varies between 250–1000&amp;amp;nbsp;mm. Riverine discharge is relatively low with the exception of the [[Blackmore River]] and [[Elizabeth River (Northern Territory)|Elizabeth River]]. Peak flow for these rivers occurs in February, respectively 605Ml/day and 389 Ml/day, after which it slowly decreases until July when there is no freshwater input into Darwin Harbour until the onset of the following wet season (Padovan 1997). [[Cyclone]] frequency is low to moderate.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;SBF&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

== Marine life ==

Darwin Harbour supports very high fish diversity with 415 fish species now known. Darwin Harbour provides a unique opportunity to see [[dugong]]s in the wild, because their
favourite food is located off Casuarina and Vestey’s beaches. Seagrass meadows are also the main diet of green turtles and provide habitats for many smaller marine animals including commercially important species such as prawns and fish.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://lrm.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/116908/DHAC_Dec-2011_Newsletter.pdf Darwin Harbour’s Marine Life.] Darwin Harbour Advisory Committee Update, December 2011, page 3.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Oceanography==

=== Currents ===
The tides at Port Darwin are macro-tidal with a maximum tidal range of 7.8 m, a mean spring range of 5.5 m and a mean neap range of 1.9 m (Padovan, 1997). The currents caused by these tides are complex and strong.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;SBF&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

=== Estuaries ===
[[File:Leaving Darwin.jpg|thumb|The Elizabeth River Bridge across Elizabeth River, upstream the East Arm of Darwin Harbour]]
Darwin Harbour is a drowned river valley and consist of [[ria]] shorelines and extensive headlands.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;SBF&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

=== Geology  ===

The underlying lithology is dominated by Permian siltstones and sandstones.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;SBF&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
