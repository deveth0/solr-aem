[[File:Allergydayquil.jpg|right|thumb|DayQuil Sinus Relief]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;DayQuil&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a medicine intended to relieve symptoms of the [[common cold]] and flu. Made by [[Vicks]], it is available in syrup and capsule (LiquiCap) form. DayQuil&amp;apos;s night time counterpart is [[NyQuil]], which contains sedative [[antihistamines]]. Because DayQuil lacks antihistamines, it does not cause drowsiness, and thus is suitable for use in the daytime. DayQuil was introduced in 1974 under the name &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;DayCare&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;. The brand was reintroduced as &amp;quot;DayQuil&amp;quot; in 1992.

As with NyQuil, DayQuil no longer contains [[pseudoephedrine]] in the United States. It has been replaced with [[phenylephrine]] due to restrictions on pseudoephedrine sales. In other countries, such as Canada, DayQuil still contains pseudoephedrine.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.vicks.ca/en/dayquil-cold-flu.php Vicks DayQuil Cold/Flu Relief]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Uses==
DayQuil is intended for the temporary relief of [[common cold|cold]] and [[flu]] symptoms, including:

* [[nasal congestion]]
* [[pharyngitis|sore throat]]
* [[headache]]
* cough due to minor throat and bronchial irritation
* muscle pains
* [[fever]]
