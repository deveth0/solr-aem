&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Estrid&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Astrid&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;of the [[Obotrites]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ca. 979 – 1035) was a Medieval and Viking age Swedish Queen consort and West Slavic Princess, married to [[Olof Skötkonung]], the [[Swedish monarch|King]] of [[Sweden]], ca. 1000&amp;amp;ndash;1022, mother of king [[Anund Jacob]] of Sweden and the [[Kievan Rus&amp;apos;]] Saint and Queen (Grand Princess) [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter]].

==Biography==
[[Legend]] says that Estrid was taken back to Sweden from a war in the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] area of [[Mecklenburg]] as a war-prize. She was most likely given by her father, a [[tribal chief]] of the [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] Obotrites, as a peace offering in a marriage to seal the peace, and she is thought to have brought with her a great dowry, as a great Slavic influence is represented in Sweden from her time, mainly among craftsmen.

Her husband also had a mistress, [[Edla]], who came from the same area in Europe as herself, and who was possibly taken to Sweden at the same time. The king treated Edla and Estrid the same way and gave his son and his two daughters with Edla the same privileges as the children he had with Estrid, though it was Estrid he married and made Queen.

Queen Estrid was baptised with her husband, their children and large numbers of the Swedish royal court in 1008, when the Swedish royal family converted to Christianity, although the king promised to respect the [[freedom of religion]] - Sweden was not to be Christian until the last religious war between [[Inge the Elder]] and [[Blot-Sweyn]] of 1084-1088.

[[Snorre Sturlasson]] wrote about her, that Estrid was unkind to the children (Emund, Astrid and Holmfrid) of her husband&amp;apos;s mistress Edla; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; Queen Estrid was arrogant and not kind towards her stepchildren, and therefore the king sent his son Emund to Vendland, where he was brought up by his maternal relatives&amp;quot;.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Not much is known of Estrid as a person. [[Snorre Sturlasson]] mentions her as a lover of pomp and luxury, and as hard and strict towards her servants.

==Children==
* [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter]] (circa 1001-1054), Grand Princess of Kiev, in [[Kievan Rus&amp;apos;]] called Anna, married [[Yaroslav I the Wise]], prince of [[Novgorod]] and [[Kiev]].
* [[Anund Jacob of Sweden|Anund Jacob]] (circa 1010-1050), king of Sweden, succeeded Olaf as king in c. 1022.
