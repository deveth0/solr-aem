The [[French language|French]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;estoc&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or [[English language|English]] &amp;quot;tuck&amp;quot; was a type of European sword in use from the 14th to 17th centuries.&amp;lt;ref name=estoc&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Loades|first=Mike|title=Swords and Swordsmen|year=2010|publisher=Pen &amp;amp; Sword Books|location=Great Britain|isbn=978-1-84884-133-8}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Characterized as having a cruciform hilt with a grip for two handed use and a straight, edgeless but sharply pointed blade of around {{convert|0.91|m|in}} to {{convert|1.32|m|in}} long.

==Description==
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;estoc&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a variation of the [[longsword]] designed for fighting against [[Mail (armour)|mail]] or [[plate armour]].&amp;lt;ref name=armsandarmour2&amp;gt;{{cite book |first=Leonid |last=Tarassuk |coauthor=Blair, Claude |title=The Complete Encyclopedia of Arms &amp;amp; Weapons: The Most Comprehensive Reference Work Ever Published on Arms and Armor from Prehistoric Times to the Present - with Over 1,200 Illustrations |publisher=[[Simon &amp;amp; Schuster]] |year=1982 |page=491}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was long, straight and stiff with no cutting edge, just a point. Examples from [[Poland]] are more than {{convert|1.57|m|in}} long, with a blade of {{convert|1.32|m|in}}; however, others showed a more manageable {{convert|1.17|m|in}}, with a {{convert|0.91|m|in}} blade. Such swords averaged about 4 pounds (2 kg) with no specimen weighing more than 6 pounds.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearma.org/essays/weights.htm |first=J. |last=Clements | title=What Did Historical Swords Weigh? |publisher=ARMA |year=2003|accessdate = 3/3/2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The size seems to have been made-to-order.

Blade cross-sections can be triangular, square, rhomboid or flat hexagonal.&amp;lt;ref name=estoc/&amp;gt; This geometry left hardly any cutting capability as a sharpened edge could simply not be ground, but allowed the weapon to become lengthy, stiff, and very acutely pointed.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;swordforms&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Clements |url=http://www.thearma.org/terms4.htm |title=Medieval &amp;amp; Renaissance Sword Forms and Companion Implements |work=Definitions &amp;amp;  Study Terminology |publisher=[[Association for Renaissance Martial Arts]]}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Early on, the estoc was hung from the [[saddle]] when on horseback and simply hung from the belt when the soldier took to the ground. As the weapon developed, however, [[infantry]]men using it began to wear it in a [[scabbard]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;glossary&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |first=George Cameron |last=Stone | authorlink = George Cameron Stone | title=A Glossary of the Construction, Decoration, and Use of Arms and Armour |publisher=Jack Brussel |year=1961 |page=223}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Most varieties of estoc provided a long [[Hilt#Grip|grip]] like that of a [[greatsword]], though others mimicked the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[zweihÃ¤nder]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in providing a long [[ricasso]] with a secondary guard of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;parrierhaken&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. As on the two-hander, this extended grip gave the wielder the advantage of extra leverage with which to more accurately and powerfully thrust the long weapon. Some other forms provided finger rings, curved [[Hilt#Guard|quillons]], or other forms of a compound hilt.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;armsandarmour2&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; Few, however, developed anything close to a full [[Basket-hilted sword|basket hilt]].

==History==

As [[armour]] improved, so did the methods of attacking the armour. It was quickly realized that cutting [[weapon]]s were losing their effectiveness, so crushing weapons such as [[Mace (club)|mace]]s and [[axe]]s were utilized. But thrusting weapons that could split the rings of [[Mail (armour)|mail]], or find the joints and crevices of [[plate armour]], were also employed. Long tapered swords could also be used as a [[lance]] once the lance was splintered. Thus was the estoc developed. The [[French language|French]] word estoc translates to thrust.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;swordforms&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; Tuck is the abbreviated [[English language|English]] version of the word. Many consider the estoc a forerunner of the [[rapier]], but more likely it is a merging of the [[espada ropera]], a civilian sword, with the effective, and lighter estoc, that produced the rapier.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} But the estoc was an effective weapon. The long, straight blade was very rigid and could be thrust with one hand, or the second hand could be used to deliver an even more powerful thrust.

While there is nothing to stop an estoc being one-handed, most were [[Two-handed sword|two-handed]], being used [[half-sword]] or two hands on the [[Hilt#Grip|grip]].
