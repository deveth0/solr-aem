&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ESPN Classic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[English language]] [[Category B Services|Category B]] [[specialty channel]] owned by CTV Speciality Television Inc. ([[Bell Media]] (80%) and [[ESPN]] (20%). ESPN Classic broadcasts a range of archive sports coverage, [[talk shows]], [[documentaries]] and [[films]].

==History==
ESPN Classic was licensed as Classic Sports in November 2000 by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), and was launched on September 7, 2001 as ESPN Classic Canada. A few years after its launch, &amp;quot;Canada&amp;quot; was dropped from its name and logo to &amp;quot;ESPN Classic&amp;quot;. ESPN Classic is the only ESPN-branded channel broadcasting in Canada, although in addition to owning a stake in the Canadian version of ESPN Classic, ESPN is part-owner of [[The Sports Network|TSN]] (which uses on-air branding similar to the flagship ESPN channel in the U.S.), along with Bell Media.

==Programming==
ESPN Classic features various archive sporting events including [[ice hockey|hockey]], [[Canadian football]], [[basketball]], [[curling]], [[boxing]] and various other sports events as well as other sports related programming including films.

Sporting events shown on ESPN Classic must take place at least 18 months after their original broadcast under CRTC licence requirements.
