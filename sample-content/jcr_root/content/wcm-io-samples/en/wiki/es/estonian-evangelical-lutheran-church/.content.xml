The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Estonian: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eesti Evangeelne Luterlik Kirik&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[Lutheran]] church in [[Estonia]]. EELC is member of the [[Lutheran World Federation]] and belongs to the [[Community of Protestant Churches in Europe]]. It is also a member of the [[Porvoo Communion]], putting it in [[full communion]] with the [[Church of England]] and other Anglican churches in Europe.

==History==
The Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church (EELC) was constituted in 1949, when the previous church hierarchy, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eesti Evangeeliumi Luteriusu Kirik&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, headed by [[bishop]] [[Johan Kõpp]], had escaped to [[Sweden]] in 1944. When the [[Soviet Union]] invaded Estonia in 1940, most Christian organizations were dissolved, church property was confiscated, theologians were exiled to [[Siberia]], and religious education programs were outlawed. [[World War II]] later brought devastation to many church buildings.  It was not until 1988 that church activities were renewed when a movement for religious tolerance began in the Soviet Union.

Although women had studied [[theology]] at [[Tartu University]] in the 1920s and some had sought ordination as priests, it was not until 1967 that the first woman, [[Laine Villenthal]], was ordained.

==Membership==
As of February 2009, the EELC reported approximately 160,000 baptized members and the EELC Abroad (based in Canada) reported approximately 8,000 baptized members.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.lutheranworld.org/LWF_Documents/LWF-Statistics-2009.pdf LWF Statistics 2009]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; A previous figure broke down the EELC Abroad into 3,508 members with 12 clergy in the USA and 5,536 members with 11 clergy in Canada.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://clclutheran.org/atlanta/bibleclass/Lutheranchurches.pdf A Brief Study of the Lutheran Churches in America]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Leadership==
The current Archbishop is the Most Rev. [[Andres Põder]]. The Archbishop of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church Abroad is the Most Rev. Dr Andres Taul, also a pastor of the [[Lutheran Church–Canada]].
