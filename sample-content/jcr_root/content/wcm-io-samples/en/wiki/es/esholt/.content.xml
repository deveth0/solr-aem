&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Esholt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] between [[Shipley, West Yorkshire|Shipley]] and [[Guiseley]], in the [[metropolitan district]] of the [[City of Bradford]], [[West Yorkshire]], England.

== History ==

The name &amp;quot;Esholt&amp;quot; indicates that the village was first established in a heavily wooded area of [[European Ash|ash]] trees.{{Citation needed |date=September 2009}}



[[File:EsholtOldHall.jpg|left|thumb|Esholt Old Hall, Church Lane]]

In the 12th century, the Esholt estate was owned by [[Syningthwaite Priory]], and a [[nunnery]] was established at Lower Esholt. When the nunnery was dissolved in about 1540 the estate was granted to Henry Thompson by [[Edward IV]].

The original manor house, Esholt Old Hall at Upper Esholt is [[medieval]] in origin, probably 16th century, and possibly once had a [[moat]]. It is well-preserved and has [[Grade II* listed building]] status.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;BLB:EH&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite web |title=Esholt Hall with Terrace and Adjoining Conservatory |work=British Listed Buildings |accessdate=2011-09-12 |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-336412-esholt-hall-with-terrace-and-adjoining-c}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the 17th century the Thompson heiress married Walter Calverley (1629â€“1694) and in 1709 their son [[Sir Walter Calverley, 1st Baronet|Walter]] built a [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]] mansion house, Esholt Hall, on the site of the old nunnery. It is now used as a conference and staff learning centre and has Grade&amp;amp;nbsp;II* listed building status.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;BLB:EH&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

In 1775 the Calverleys sold the estate to Robert Stansfield whose family remained in possession until 1906 when it was sold to Bradford City Council. The current owner of the estate, [[Yorkshire Water]], operates a [[sewage treatment]] plant on what was the location of the Airedale Aerodrome.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;YFB&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Graeme |title=Yorkshire Millennium Factbook |isbn=1-85568-168-4}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Religion ==
[[File:St Paul&amp;apos;s Church, Esholt - geograph.org.uk - 36391.jpg|left|thumb|St. Paul&amp;apos;s Church]]

Historically part of the parish of [[Guiseley]],&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;GEN:APoG&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/WRY/Guiseley/index.html |title=The Ancient Parish of Guiseley |publisher=[[GENUKI]] |accessdate=2007-10-29}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
the Church of St Paul is a successor to the private chapel of the old manor house. The church was built in 1839 by William Rookes Crompton-Stansfield for use as a private family chapel and not consecrated until 1853. Since 1983 it has been in the combined parish of Guiseley with Esholt.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.guiseleywithesholt.org.uk/index.php?PageID=stpauls| title =St Paul&amp;apos;s Church| accessdate = 30 March 2013}} &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

From 1976 to 1996 Esholt was used for outside location shots for the [[Yorkshire Television]] drama series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Emmerdale|Emmerdale Farm later Emmerdale]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;IMDb&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068069/locations |title=Filming locations for Emmerdale |work=IMDb |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
The series relocated to a purpose built set based on the layout of Esholt on the [[Harewood House|Harewood estate]] in [[Leeds]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;IMDb&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

While the village was used as a filming location, the name of the village pub was changed from the Commercial Inn to [[The Woolpack]]. The Home Farm of the series is derived from the Home Farm that exists on the Esholt Estate, dating back to 1691.
