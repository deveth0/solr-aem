{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tsubouchi Shōyō&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|坪内 逍遥||extra=born May 22, 1859 &amp;amp;ndash; February 28, 1935}} was a [[Japanese author]], [[critic]], [[playwright]], [[translator]], [[editing|editor]], [[educator]], and [[professor]] at [[Waseda University]]. He was born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tsubouchi Yūzō&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (坪内 雄蔵), in [[Gifu Prefecture|Gifu prefecture]].  He also used the [[pen name]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Haru no Yaoboro&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (春 の やおぼろ).

His book of criticism, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shōsetsu Shinzui&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (The Essence of the Novel), helped free novels and dramas from the low opinion that the Japanese had of such literature. Tsubouchi&amp;apos;s writings on realism in literature influenced [[Masaoka Shiki]]&amp;apos;s ideas about realism in [[haiku]]. Tsubouchi&amp;apos;s novel, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tōsei Shosei Kishitsu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Portraits of Contemporary Students), was one of the earliest modern novels in Japan.

His [[Kabuki]] play &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kiri Hitoha&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Paulownia Leaf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was influenced by his studies of both the famous Kabuki and [[Jōruri]] (puppet theater) dramatist [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]] and [[William Shakespeare]]. The play, in turn, influenced modern Kabuki. He also did a complete translation of the plays of Shakespeare, written in the old-fashion language of Kabuki.

His modern play, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shinkyoku Urashima&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, incorporating traditional dance and music, was a popular and critical success. The play was a retelling of a familiar Japanese [[Folklore|folk-tale]] with a [[Rip Van Winkle]]-like protagonist, [[Urashima Tarō]].

Besides Shakespeare, he also translated a number of other works from English into Japanese, including [[Sir Walter Scott]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Bride of Lammermoor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Bulwer-Lytton]]&amp;apos;s novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rienzi, the Last of the Roman Tribunes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Tsubouchi founded and edited the periodical &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Waseda Bungaku&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Waseda Literature), which published from 1891 to 1898. Tsubouchi is also noted for the long running ronsō (literary dispute) that he carried on with [[Mori Ōgai]].
