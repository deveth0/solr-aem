&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;CISS-FM&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Canada|Canadian]] radio station in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]. The station broadcasts a [[hot adult contemporary]] format at 105.3 on the [[FM radio|FM]] dial, using the brand name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;105.3 Kiss FM&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==History==

The station was launched in 1972 with the call letters &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[CKBY-FM|CKBY]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, playing a [[country music]] format.

On January 9, [[2004 in radio|2004]], the station adopted a [[hot adult contemporary]] format and the &amp;quot;105.3 KISS FM&amp;quot; moniker. The station launched with [[Pink (singer)|Pink&amp;apos;s]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Get The Party Started]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. A month later after the format change, the station adopted its current calls.  The CISS calls previously belonged to a [[Toronto]] radio station, also owned by Rogers, which now uses the call letters [[CKIS-FM]]. The CKBY calls, in turn, were moved to a third Rogers station in [[Smiths Falls, Ontario|Smiths Falls]]. In the station&amp;apos;s early years, the station&amp;apos;s playlist was very similar to that of [[CHUM-FM]] in Toronto, but with a less [[rhythmic adult contemporary|rhythmic]] lean.  Later that year, it shifted from [[Hot AC]] to [[adult top 40]].

KISS-FM came at the expense of 101.1 XFM, an alternative rock station that was shut down to make way for KISS and for a move of [[Country music|country]] radio Y105, currently [[CKBY-FM|Y101]], to another frequency. The two [[Breakfast television|morning show]] hosts of XFM, Mauler and Rush, were left unemployed.

On August 13, 2004, popular morning show hosts Carter Brown, Sandra Plagakis, Andrew &amp;quot;The Boyle&amp;quot; Boyle and Jenny “From the Block” Usher resigned from competing [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]] station [[CIHT-FM]] and became the new morning hosts at Kiss FM. Mauler and Rush ultimately became the hosts of the morning show at CIHT.

With the flip of the [[CKIS-FM|former CISS]] in [[Toronto]] from [[Jack FM]] to [[top 40]] as Kiss FM on June 5, [[2009 in radio|2009]], the CISS calls remained unchanged on this station.  As a result, Rogers swapped the [[CJAQ-FM]] calls in Toronto with the former CKIS-FM (a [[Jack FM]] station) in [[Calgary]].

More recently, as of the fall of [[2009 in radio|2009]], CISS has began to lean more rhythmic again and dropped most [[modern adult contemporary]] artists.

As of [[2011 in radio|2011]], the station has eliminated the majority of its pre-[[1999 in music|1999]] playlist and sticks towards a more 2000s-now direction. A new logo was added, along with adding the tagline &amp;quot;The New&amp;quot; in its &amp;quot;KISS FM&amp;quot; branding. The station leans heavily on rhythmic material, especially during nights and weekends, when the station plays songs that other Hot AC stations in Canada won&amp;apos;t play, more in the style of a CHR station and to compete with CIHT. However, CIHT still plays pre-1999 music, and continues to beat Kiss in ratings by a large margin, though Kiss FM&amp;apos;s ratings have improved slightly since the addition of rhythmic material.  This station, however, still sticks to the Canadian hot AC panel of [[Mediabase]] &amp;amp; [[Nielsen BDS]].
