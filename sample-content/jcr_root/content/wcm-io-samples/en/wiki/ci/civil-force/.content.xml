&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Civil Force&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|t=公民力量}}) is a community alliance in the [[Hong Kong]] [[Special Administrative Region of the People&amp;apos;s Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]] of the [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China]]. It was established in 1993 by a former member of [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]], [[Lau Kong-wah]] and 8 other [[Sha Tin District Council|Sha Tin District Board]] members. The group is active on local district affairs in the [[Sha Tin District]] and [[Sai Kung District]]. Lau remains the convenor of Civil Force.

Lau was defeated by [[Emily Lau]] in the 1991 and 1995 elections of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] (LegCo). In 1996, Lau secured a seat in the [[Provisional Legislative Council]]. He was elected into LegCo in since [[Hong Kong legislative election, 1998|1998 LegCo elections]] in the [[New Territories East (constituency)|New Territories East]] geographical constituency, after he joined the pro-[[Communist Party of China|Beijing]] [[Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong]] (DAB).

In 2003, due to the pro-Government stance of DAB especially on the issue of implementing [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Article 23 of the Basic Law]], the popularity of Lau, being a member of the DAB, was affected, and the Civil Force performed not as well in the [[Hong Kong local elections, 2003|2003 District Council elections]]. Campaigns of some of the members emphasise more on the banner of Civil Force and their local contributions, and did not mention the convenor&amp;apos;s connection with the DAB. Lau himself lost the seat in the [[Kam To (constituency)|Kam To constituency]] for the [[Sha Tin District Council]] despite his long service in the district. The Civil Force retained 14 seats in the Sha Tin District Council, and 3 seats in the [[Sai Kung District Council]].

In the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2012|2012 Legislative Council election]], Lau Kong-wah lost in the [[District Council (Second)]] constituency election while the newly-joined member Scarlett Pong failed to win a seat in the New Territories East constituency. Civil Force had not been represented in the Legislative Council for the first time.

On 14 March 2013, LegCo member [[Lam Tai-fai]] told the press on that he had already joined the Civil Force on 1 January 2013, which made the organisation retained one seat in the Legislative Council.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://hk.news.yahoo.com/%E6%9E%97%E5%A4%A7%E8%BC%9D%E5%AB%81%E5%85%A5%E5%85%AC%E6%B0%91%E5%8A%9B%E9%87%8F-211003328.html|title=林大輝嫁入公民力量|newspaper=Ming Pao|date=15 March 2013|accessdate=29 April 2013|language=Chinese}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
