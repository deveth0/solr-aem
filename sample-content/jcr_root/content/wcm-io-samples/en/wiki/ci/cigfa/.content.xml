        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cigfa ferch Gwyn Glohoyw&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Middle Welsh]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kigua&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a minor character in [[Welsh mythology]], the wife of King [[Pryderi]] of [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Dyfed]]. She is mentioned briefly in the [[Pwyll Pendefig Dyfed|First Branch]] of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mabinogi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and appears more prominently in the [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi#Manawyddan.2C son of Llyr|third]]. Describing the character, Proinsias Mac Cana writes:  &amp;quot;Cigfa strikes one as a slight though effective vignette of a contemporary bourgeois snob&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Parker, Will. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Four Branches of the Mabinogi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; while [[William John Gruffydd]] hypothesises that the character was a later addition to the tale.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Gruffydd, W. D. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rhiannon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Cardiff, 1953.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[John Rhys]] suggested a connection between Cigfa and the [[Irish mythology|Irish]] character &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ciochba&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Hughes MUL&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Hughes, Ian. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Manawydan uab Llyr&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Role in Welsh tradition==
After ascending to the throne of Dyfed, Pryderi searches for a wife and marries Cigfa, whose ancestry is recorded as &amp;quot;Cigfa, daughter of Gwyn Glohoyw, son of Gloyw Walltlydan, son of Casnar Wledig&amp;quot;. A similar lineage can be found in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bonedd y Saint]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in which a saint named Mechyll fab Echwys is the grandson of Gwyn Glohoyw and great-grandson of Gloyw Walltlydan. Cigfa herself is not mentioned in the genealogy.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Hughes MUL&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

Some time after their marriage, Pryderi leaves Dyfed to fight under [[Bran the Blessed|Bendigeidfran]] in [[Ireland]]. He is one of only seven warriors to survive the battle, and returns home with [[Manawydan]], rightful king of Britain, whom he married to his mother [[Rhiannon]]. The four friends live happily until they ascend the mound at Gorsedd Arberth and the kingdom turns into a barren [[wasteland (mythology)|wasteland]], and all of its inhabitants disappear except for the four members of Pryderi&amp;apos;s family.

While out hunting one day, Pryderi follows a white [[boar]] and does not return, so his mother Rhiannon goes looking for him. She finds him motionless inside a mysterious building, touching a golden bowl. She tries to free him, but becomes enchanted herself when she puts her hand on the object. Manawydan and Cigfa stay together, the former promising to protect the latter, and finally free their spouses when they capture a [[mouse]] that is actually the wife of [[Llwyd ap Cil Coed]], Rhiannon&amp;apos;s enemy, and force the magician to lift the curses plaguing their land.
