        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;West Coast Computer Faire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an annual computer industry conference and exposition most often associated with [[San Francisco]], its first and most frequent venue. The first fair was held in 1977 and was organized by [[Jim Warren (computer specialist)|Jim Warren]] and [[Bob Reiling]]. At the time it was the biggest computer show in the world, intended to popularize the [[personal computer]] in the home. The West Coast PC Faire was formed to provide a more specialized show.  However, Apple stopped exhibiting at the West Coast Computer Faire, refusing to exhibit at any show other than Comdex that also had PC based exhibits.
In 1983, Warren sold the rights to the Faire for US$3 million to [[Prentice Hall]], who later sold it to [[Sheldon Adelson]], the owner of Interface Group and [[COMDEX]]. In total sixteen shows were held, with the last in 1991.  After Jim Warren sold the show, it had a few more good years, and then declined rapidly.

==History==
Some people refer to the first fair as the birth of the [[personal computer]] industry. It took place on April 16–17, 1977, in San Francisco Civic Auditorium &amp;amp; Brooks Hall, and saw the debut of the [[Commodore PET]], presented by [[Chuck Peddle]], and the [[Apple II]], presented by then-21-year-old [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Steve Wozniak]]. At the exhibition, Jobs introduced the Apple II to a [[Japan]]ese textile maker, Mizushima Satoshi, who became the first authorized Apple dealer in Japan.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Walter Isaacson]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Steve Jobs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Chapter Six – &amp;quot;The Apple II&amp;quot; pp. 144. Simon &amp;amp; Schuster (October 24, 2011) ISBN 1-4516-4855-3&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- this was previously linked to http://www.openbook.tv/book2/2_chapter1.htm; however the whole domain was &amp;quot;parked&amp;quot; as of November 2007
In March 2009, the domain was listed as &amp;quot;on sale,&amp;quot; so we may presume that it was abandoned--&amp;gt;
There were about 180 exhibitors, among them [[Intel]], [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]], and [[Digital Research]]. More than 12,000 people visited the fair.

The 2nd West Coast Computer Faire was held March 3–5, 1978, at the San Jose Convention Center. This event had the first-ever micro[[computer chess]] tournament, won by [[Sargon (chess)|Sargon]].

The 3rd West Coast Computer Faire was held November 3–5, 1978, at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

The 4th West Coast Computer Faire returned to San Francisco in May 1979 at Brooks Hall and Civic Auditorium. [[Dan Bricklin]] demonstrated [[VisiCalc]], the first [[spreadsheet]] program for personal computers.

At the 5th West Coast Computer Faire, held in March 1980, [[Microsoft]] announced their first hardware product, the [[Z-80 SoftCard]], which gave the Apple II [[CP/M]] capabilities.

The 6th West Coast Computer Faire was held in April 1981, when [[Adam Osborne]] introduced the [[Osborne 1]].

The 7th West Coast Computer Faire saw the introduction of the 5MB Winchester [[disk drive]] for [[IBM PC]]s by [[Davong Systems]]. It was held on March 19–21, 1982 in San Francisco.  That year&amp;apos;s conference also featured a Saturday breakout session, titled &amp;quot;THE IBM PERSONAL COMPUTER&amp;quot;, with eight talks delivered in a three-hour period.  One of these was (as listed in the program):

 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;P.C. — It&amp;apos;s Impact on the MicroComputer Industry&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;lt;!-- sic; do not &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; typos, capitalization, or punctuation --&amp;gt;
 Bill Gates, President
 Microsoft

 Bellevue, WA 98004

At its peak, all available spaces for exhibits were rented out, including the balcony of Civic Auditorium, and the hallway to the restrooms in Brooks Hall (Where Bob Wallace (&amp;quot;Quicksoft&amp;quot;) introduced &amp;quot;PC Write&amp;quot;)

The 8th West Coast Computer Faire was held from March 18–20, 1983.

Subsequent West Coast Computer Faires were held in [[Moscone Center]] in San Francisco.

The 16th West Coast Computer Faire was held from May 30 to June 2, 1991, at Moscone Center in San Francisco.
