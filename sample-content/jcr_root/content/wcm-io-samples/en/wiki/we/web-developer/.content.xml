A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;web developer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[programmer]] who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of [[World Wide Web]] applications, or distributed network applications that are run over [[HTTP]] from a [[web server]] to a [[web browser]].

== Nature of employment ==

Web developers can be found working in all types of organizations, including large [[corporations]] and [[governments]], small and medium sized [[companies]], or alone as [[freelancers]]. Some web developers work for one organization as a permanent [[full-time]] employee, while others may work as independent [[consultants]], or as contractors for an [[employment agency]]

== Type of work performed ==

Modern [[web applications]] often contain three or more [[Multitier architecture|tiers]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Web_application#Components | title=Web application | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2012-12-07 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and depending on the size of the team a developer works on, he or she may specialize in one or more of these tiers - or may take a more [[interdisciplinary]] role.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Web_development | title=Web development | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2012-12-07 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; For example, in a two person team, one developer may focus on the technologies sent to the [[Client-side|client]] such as [[HTML]], [[JavaScript]], [[CSS]], and on the [[server-side]] frameworks (such as [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[PHP]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]], [[ASP.NET MVC Framework|.NET MVC]]) used to deliver content and scripts to the client. Meanwhile the other developer might focus on the interaction between server-side frameworks, the [[web server]], and a [[database]] system. Further, depending on the size of their organization, the aforementioned developers might work closely with a content creator/copy writer, marketing advisor, [[web designer]], [[web producer]], [[project manager]], [[software architect]], or [[database administrator]] - or they may be responsible for such tasks as [[web design]] and [[project management]] themselves.

== Educational and licensure requirements ==

There are no formal educational or licensure requirements to become a web developer. However, many colleges and trade schools offer coursework in web development. There are also many tutorials and articles, which teach web development, freely available on the web - for example: http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Basic_JavaScript

Even though there are no formal educational requirements, dealing with web developing projects requires those who wish to be referred to as web developers to have advanced knowledge/skills in:
* HTML/XHTML, CSS, JavaScript
* [[server-side|Server]]/[[Client-side|Client]] side architecture
* Programming/Coding/Scripting in one of the many server-side frameworks (at least one of: [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[PHP]], [[ColdFusion Markup Language|CFML - ColdFusion]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]], [[ASP.NET MVC Framework|.NET MVC]])
* Ability to utilize a [[Web development#Database_Technology|database]]
