Division Three of the [[Welsh Football League]] (currently the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;MacWhirter Welsh League Division Three&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, for sponsorship reasons) is a [[football (soccer)|football]] league and forms the fourth level of the [[Welsh football league system]] in south [[Wales]].

If the team which finishes top of the Division has good enough ground facilities, it is promoted to the [[Welsh Football League Division Two]] and is replaced by the team finishing bottom of Division Two. The team finishing in bottom position is relegated to one of the local leagues.
