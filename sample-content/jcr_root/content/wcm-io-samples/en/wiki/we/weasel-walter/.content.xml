&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Weasel Walter&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[composer]] and instrumentalist who founded the band [[The Flying Luttenbachers]] in Chicago in 1991 with late jazz cult figure [[Hal Russell]] and is a current member of Cellular Chaos and [[Behold...The Arctopus]]. Over the years, The Flying Luttenbachers included noted Chicago musicians such as [[Ken Vandermark]], [[Jeb Bishop]], [[Fred Lonberg-Holm]], [[Dylan Posa]], and [[Michael Colligan]], while creating an uncompromising and mercurial body of abstract music drawing equally from [[no wave]], [[death metal]], [[free jazz]], [[gamelan]], [[noise music]], [[hardcore punk]] and [[modern classical]]. Walter moved to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in 2003, where he formed the latest of many Luttenbachers lineups, remaining on percussion with the addition of bassist Mike Green ([[Burmese (band)|Burmese]]), and virtuoso guitarist Ed Rodriguez (ex-[[Colossamite]], [[Gorge Trio]]). Singular guitar phenomenon [[Mick Barr]] ([[Krallice]], [[Octis]], [[Orthrelm]]) joined the group in 2005. The Flying Luttenbachers ceased to operate in late 2007. On November 25, 2009, Weasel Walter announced that he was moving to New York City to join the band [[Behold... The Arctopus]] on drums and will be writing &amp;quot;new, more extreme material from scratch.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-01-12/music/the-weasel-walter-welcome-wagon/2/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He also formed [[Cellular Chaos]] with [[Marc Edwards (drummer)]] and [[Ceci Moss]].

==History==
Before relocating to the West Coast, Walter was a major contributor to the Chicago no-wave/noise/improvised music underground during the &amp;apos;90s and early 2000s.  During this period, he performed as a founding member of bands such as [[The Flying Luttenbachers]], [[Miss High Heel]] (with [[Jim O&amp;apos;Rourke (musician)|Jim O&amp;apos;Rourke]] and [[Azita Youssefi|Azita]] of [[The Scissor Girls]]), Lake of Dracula (with Marlon Magas and Heather M. of the Scissor Girls), [[To Live and Shave in L.A. 2]], 7000 Dying Rats and Hatewave (replacing founder Nandor Nevai) among others. Walter has most recently relocated to New York City.

Walter has collaborated with many artists which include but are not limited to [[Evan Parker]], [[Elliott Sharp]], [[John Butcher (musician)|John Butcher]], [[Marshall Allen]], [[Peter Evans (musician)|Peter Evans]], [[Mary Halvorson]], [[Tim Dahl]], [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]], Damon Smith, [[Vinny Golia]], [[Joe Morris (guitarist)|Joe Morris]], [[Frank Gratkowski]], [[William Winant]], [[Marlon Magas]], [[Jim O&amp;apos;Rourke (musician)|Jim O&amp;apos;Rourke]], [[Tom Smith (noise musician)|Tom Smith]] in [[To Live and Shave in L.A.]],  and [[Ken Vandermark]] as well as many influential underground rock bands including [[Lair of the Minotaur]], [[Bobby Conn]], [[U.S. Maple]], [[Cock E.S.P.]], [[Curse of the Birthmark]], the Scissor Girls, [[Erase Errata]], The Chicago Sound, [[Harry Pussy]], [[Quintron]], [[Sharon Cheslow]], [[XBXRX]], and [[Cheer-Accident]], in addition to producing albums by the [[Coachwhips]], Burmese, Total Shutdown, [[Arab on Radar]], AIDS Wolf, and [[Glenn Branca]].
