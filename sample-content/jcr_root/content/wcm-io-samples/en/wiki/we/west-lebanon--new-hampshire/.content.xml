&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;West Lebanon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a district (pop. approx 3,500) within the city of [[Lebanon, New Hampshire|Lebanon]], [[New Hampshire]], on the [[Connecticut River]]. The area contains a major shopping plaza strip along [[New Hampshire Route 12A]], serving the [[Upper Valley (Connecticut River)|Upper Valley]] communities along Interstates [[Interstate 89|89]] and [[Interstate 91|91]]. West Lebanon also hosts the [[Lebanon Municipal Airport (New Hampshire)|Lebanon Municipal Airport]], a number of small software and tech businesses, and a regional daily newspaper, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Valley News]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The village, referred to by locals as &amp;quot;West Leb&amp;quot;, serves as a bedroom community for nearby [[Dartmouth College]].

West Lebanon was the site of Lebanon&amp;apos;s first settlement in 1761. Later the village became a regionally important [[rail transport|rail hub]], although at that time it was better known to rail travelers as Westboro. By the 1950s, however, the rail industry had shrunk significantly.  The village of [[White River Junction, Vermont]], across the Connecticut River, took most of the remaining services, and the rail service through West Lebanon was terminated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Today commerce has replaced transportation as the basis of the economy, and West Lebanon serves as the commercial hub for a [[United States micropolitan area]] of over 170,000 people.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;
