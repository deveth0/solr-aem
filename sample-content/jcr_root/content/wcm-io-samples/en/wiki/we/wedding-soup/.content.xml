&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wedding soup&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Italian wedding soup&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[Italian-American cuisine|Italian-American]]&amp;lt;ref name=post-gaz&amp;gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Diana Nelson|title=Food historian shows how immigrant recipes have survived, and served, America|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sectionfront/life/food-historian-shows-how-immigrant-recipes-have-survived-and-served-america-543894/|accessdate=17 November 2012|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=July 22, 2004}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[soup]] consisting of green vegetables and meat. It is popular in the United States, where it is a staple in many Italian restaurants.

==Ingredients==
Wedding soup consists of [[green vegetable]]s (usually [[endive]] and [[escarole]] or [[cabbage]], [[lettuce]], [[kale]], and/or [[spinach]]) and meat (usually [[meatball]]s and/or [[sausage]]) in a clear chicken-based [[broth]]. Wedding soup sometimes contains [[cavatelli]], [[acini di pepe]], [[pastina]], [[orzo (pasta)|orzo]], other [[pasta]], [[lentils]],  or shredded [[Chicken (food)|chicken]].

==Origin==
The term &amp;quot;wedding soup&amp;quot; is a mistranslation of the Italian language phrase &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;minestra maritata&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;married soup&amp;quot;),&amp;quot; which is a reference to the fact that green vegetables and meats go well together. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;minestra maritata&amp;apos;&amp;apos; recipe is also prepared by the families of [[Lazio]] and [[Campania]] during the Christmas season (a tradition started from the Spanish domination of Italy to the present days). Some form of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;minestra maritata&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was long popular in [[Toledo, Spain]], before pasta became an affordable commodity to most Spaniards.{{cn|date=March 2012}} The modern wedding soup is quite a bit lighter than the old Spanish form, which contained more meats than just the meatballs of modern Italian-American versions.
