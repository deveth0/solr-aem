The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Western Canada Concept Party of BC&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a provincial political party in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. It was the British Columbia branch of the [[Western Canada Concept]], a political party that operated at the federal level, advocating the separation of the four western provinces of Canada and the formation of a new country comprising British Columbia, [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]].

The party&amp;apos;s leader until 2013 was [[Doug Christie (lawyer)|Doug Christie]], a far right lawyer best known for defending [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]].

In the May 5, [[British Columbia general election, 1983|1983, British Columbia provincial election]], the party nominated 18 candidates. They won 14,185 votes, or 0.86% of the popular vote. Another western separatist party, the [[Western National Party]], ran two candidates, who collected 474 votes (0.03% of the total).

In the October 22, [[British Columbia general election, 1986|1986 election]], the party nominated one candidate, who won 322 votes, or 0.02% of the popular vote.

In the October 17, [[British Columbia general election, 1991|1991 election]], the party nominated 5 candidates, who collected 651 votes, or 0.04% of the popular vote.

In the May 17, [[British Columbia general election, 2005|2005 election]], the party nominated 2 candidates, who collected a total of 374 votes, 0.02% of the popular vote. Doug Christie won 202 votes (0.76%) in Saanich South, and Pattie O&amp;apos;Brien won 172 votes (0.66%) in Malahat-Juan de Fuca.

In 2005, Christie established a western separatist party to operate at the federal political level, the [[Western Block Party]].

The WCC is not affiliated with the [[Separation Party of Alberta]] or the [[Western Independence Party of Saskatchewan]]. Officials in these parties have distanced themselves from Christie - for example, they do not include links to the WCC or WBP on their websites even though the SPA and WIPS do link to one another.
