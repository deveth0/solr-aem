&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Weston under Penyard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small village in [[Herefordshire]], [[England]].

It lies on the [[A40 road]] two miles east of [[Ross-on-Wye]]. The Penyard is a prominent hill.

The parish church of [[St Lawrence]] has a tall 14th century west tower which had a spire until it was damaged by lightning in 1750.

A [[methodist]] [[chapel]] was constructed during the early 19th century but was disused by 1964.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/43225/pages/589/page.pdf&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The building was subsequently converted for use as private residence.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.zoopla.co.uk/property-history/the-old-chapel/bury-hill/weston-under-penyard/ross-on-wye/hr9-7ps/22401328&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Slightly to the east under farmland lies the former [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] settlement of [[Ariconium]], which gave its name to the historical areas of Herefordshire known as [[Ergyng]] and [[Archenfield]]. The name Ariconium is [[Romano-British]] and may conceivably have an equivalent in or near the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Galatia]].

The Bristol merchant [[Richard Amerike]] (c. 1445â€“1503) who, it is claimed, gave his name to [[Americas|America]], was born here.

On the edge of the village is Bollitree Castle, which is currently owned by Top Gear presenter [[Richard Hammond]].  It comprises a house built c1700 incorporating  the remains of an earlier building, to which castellated walls, turrets and moat were added in the late eighteenth century.  Two miles south west are the fragmentary remains of Penyard Castle, a fourteenth-century castle on the site of which was built a seventeenth-century house.
