        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Westminster Larger Catechism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, along with the [[Westminster Shorter Catechism]], is a central [[catechism]] of [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] in the [[England|English]] tradition throughout the world.

== History ==
In 1643 when the [[Long Parliament]] of England called the [[Westminster Assembly]] to produce the [[Westminster Confession]], it also asked for a directory of &amp;quot;catechising&amp;quot;. The Assembly asked [[Herbert Palmer (Puritan)|Herbert Palmer]] to produce a draft of the Larger Catechism. [[Robert Baillie]] and other [[Scotland|Scottish]] delegates found the work disappointing. In December 1643 a committee was formed to write the Catechism. In January 1647 the [[Westminster Assembly|Assembly]] gave up writing one [[catechism]] and split it into two. The [[Westminster Shorter Catechism]] was to be &amp;quot;easier to read and concise for beginners&amp;quot; and the Larger Catechism was to be &amp;quot;more exact and comprehensive&amp;quot;.  The Catechism was completed by the [[Westminster Assembly]] in 1647. It was then adopted by the General Assembly of the [[Church of Scotland]] in 1648 and (with modifications relating to the civil magistrate) by the [[Presbyterian]] Synod of [[New York]] and [[Philadelphia]] in 1788.
