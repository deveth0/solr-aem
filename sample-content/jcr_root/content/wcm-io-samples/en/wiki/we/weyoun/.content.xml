&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Weyoun&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[fictional character]] from the television series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in which he is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Combs]]. In the series, Weyoun is a diplomat and advisor of the [[Vorta]] species who is a member of the ruthless and militaristic [[Galactic quadrant (Star Trek)|Gamma quadrant]] state the  [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]]. Like all Vorta, Weyoun is officious and sycophantic, always deferring to the Founders yet being ruthless in dealing with enemies and those under his command.

Combs, who also played the recurring character of [[List of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine characters#Brunt|Brunt]] on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Deep Space Nine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, stated that he preferred playing Weyoun.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite interview|last = Combs|first=Jeffrey|subjectlink=Jeffrey Combs|interviewer=startrek.com|title=An Interview with Jeffrey Combs - Part 2|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/videoview?id=8275}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Overview==
There were actually several Weyouns, all clones. The Weyoun line first appeared in &amp;quot;[[To the Death (DS9 episode)|To the Death]]&amp;quot; in the guise of Weyoun 4. He was killed by his own [[Jem&amp;apos;Hadar]] First after questioning his men&amp;apos;s loyalty. Weyoun 5 first appeared in an attempt to convince a [[Cardassian]] defector to return home and support the regime (episode &amp;quot;[[Ties of Blood and Water (DS9 episode)|Ties of Blood and Water]]&amp;quot;), and was the first to serve as commander of Dominion forces in the Alpha Quadrant. At some point between the episodes &amp;quot;[[Shadows and Symbols]]&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;[[Treachery, Faith, and the Great River (DS9 episode)|Treachery, Faith, and the Great River]]&amp;quot;, he was killed in a [[transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] accident that may have been arranged by Legate [[Damar (Star Trek)|Damar]].

Weyoun 6 tried to [[defection|defect]] to the Federation but sacrificed his own life in order to prevent [[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]]&amp;apos;s death. Weyoun 7 was activated after the discovery of Weyoun 6&amp;apos;s attempt to defect. Under normal circumstances, there is only one clone (of any given Vorta operative) operating at a time, but when Weyoun 6 defected, Weyoun 7 was immediately activated. Weyoun 7 was killed by Lieutenant Commander [[Worf]] (&amp;quot;[[Strange Bedfellows (DS9 episode)|Strange Bedfellows]]&amp;quot;). Worf is later mocked for this, as he had killed a mere clone instead of an enemy that was less replaceable.

[[Elim Garak]] killed Weyoun 8 during the Cardassian underground&amp;apos;s assault on Dominion headquarters during the Battle of Cardassia (&amp;quot;[[What You Leave Behind (DS9 episode)|What You Leave Behind, Part II]]&amp;quot;). Upon his death, the [[Female Changeling]] observes that Weyoun 8 was the last Weyoun clone, a fact that Garak, who loathed Weyoun, finds most gratifying, remarking: &amp;quot;I was hoping you&amp;apos;d say that!&amp;quot; This would be the last of the Weyoun clones, as a result of the destruction of the cloning facility on Rondac III (&amp;quot;[[The Changing Face of Evil]]&amp;quot;).

A ninth Weyoun appeared in the non-[[Star Trek canon|canon]] novels of the [[Deep Space Nine relaunch]], thus implying that the Female Changeling was referring only to Weyouns available in the Alpha Quadrant, while Weyoun&amp;apos;s original genetic records were still available in the Gamma Quadrant.
