&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oregon Route 212&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[Oregon]] [[state highway]] that serves the eastern [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] metro area. It is an east&amp;amp;ndash;west route, running between [[Boring, Oregon|Boring]] and [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]].

==Route description==
[[Image:Boringorcity.jpg|thumb|&amp;quot;Boring/Oregon City&amp;quot; sign at OR 212/US 26 interchange]]

OR 212 begins east of [[Boring, Oregon|Boring]] and northwest of [[Sandy, Oregon|Sandy]] at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 26 (Oregon)|U.S. Route 26]]. OR 212 heads west, through the small town of Boring, and through the small city of [[Damascus, Oregon|Damascus]]. On the route between these two towns are numerous intersections with backroads that lead to [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]], Portland&amp;apos;s biggest eastern suburb. The sides of this route are covered in [[farm]]s and berry fields.  This section of OR 212 is the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Clackamas-Boring Highway No. 174&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (see [[Oregon highways and routes]]).

After Damascus, the highway intersects with [[Oregon Route 224|OR 224]], just east of [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]]. It quickly becomes four lanes (two in each direction) as it speeds past warehouses in the Portland suburb, marked as both OR 212 and OR 224. After several miles, which are heavily traveled by [[truck]]s, the highway comes to its western terminus, at an intersection with [[Interstate 205 (Oregon)|Interstate 205]] and [[Oregon Route 213|OR 213]].  This section of OR 212 is part of the [[Clackamas Highway]] No. 171.

Plans are in the works to build a new alignment of OR 212 between I-205 and US 26; this new route (called the [[Sunrise Corridor]]) is expected to be (at least for the westernmost segment) a [[freeway]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Under a contract with the state, Macquarie, the largest toll road operator in the world, is also exploring toll roads as a way to pay for widening the southern portion of Interstate 205 and a new Sunrise Corridor highway from I-205 toward Damascus.&amp;quot; http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/1146375113146680.xml&amp;amp;coll=7&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

===Towns and cities along the route===
[[Image:BoringORSign fxwb.jpg|thumb|Road sign on Oregon Route 212]]
* [[Boring, Oregon|Boring]]
* [[Damascus, Oregon|Damascus]]
* [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]]

===Intersections with other highways===
* U.S. Route 26 east of Boring
* OR 224 east of Clackamas (segment is shared with OR 224)
* Interstate 205 and OR 213 in Clackamas

==History==

A previous alignment through Boring ran due west onto Fireman Way, curving south onto 272nd.

Two junctions with 257th Ave give away an old alignment.  OR 212 traveled due west on the eastern junction with 257th, curving south to meet the western junction.

Armstrong Circle at 172nd is a previous alignment.

Before the construction of I-205, OR 212 continued west on a shared alignment with [[Oregon Route 213|OR 213]] to [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]].  There, it crossed the [[Willamette River]] into [[West Linn, Oregon|West Linn]] and continued west to [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]] where it eventually terminated at an intersection with [[Oregon Route 99W|OR 99W]].  This section replaced the original [[Oregon Route 244]], but was eventually [[decommissioned highway|decommissioned]] after I-205 was completed; however the entire route can still be driven (other than a now-closed bridge across the [[Clackamas River]] which used to connect Oregon City with [[Gladstone, Oregon]]).

Before US 26 was rerouted, it used to run on Orient Drive.  OR 212 traveled this brief segment of Compton Road before the US 26 realignment shortened it.
