&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oran Henry Pape&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (March 10, 1904 &amp;amp;ndash; April 30, 1936) was a member of the [[Iowa State Patrol]] in the [[United States]].  To date, he is the only member of the Patrol to have been [[murdered]] in the line of duty.

Prior to joining the Patrol, Pape played [[American football]].  He played [[high school football]] at [[Dubuque Senior High School]], where he was part of the 1924 Iowa State championship football team.  Pape then played [[college football]] at the [[University of Iowa]].  Following college, he played in the [[National Football League]] for the [[Green Bay Packers]], the [[Minneapolis Red Jackets]], the [[Providence Steam Roller]], the [[Washington Redskins|Boston Braves]], and the [[Staten Island Stapletons]], it was with the Packers, that he was a member of their 1930 [[NFL Championship]] team, he left the NFL in 1934, and returned to Iowa, where he attended the State Police Academy At [[Camp Dodge]].

Pape was appointed to the newly formed Iowa Highway Patrol (later [[Iowa State Patrol]]) in August 1935, one of the first men to become an officer in the Patrol.

On April 28, 1936, Pape was patrolling [[U.S. Highway 61]] near [[Muscatine, Iowa]].  He noticed a car that had been reported stolen.  After pulling the car over, Pape approached the car.  The driver, Roscoe Barton, pointed his gun at Pape and ordered him into his car.  Barton drove away with Pape as his hostage.  A short while later, Pape saw an opportunity to overpower Barton, and the two began struggling.  During the struggle, Barton was shot in the head, and Pape was shot in the [[Human abdomen|abdomen]].

Both men were taken to Mercy Hospital (now [[Genesis Medical Center]]) in [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]].  Barton died from his injuries soon after arriving at the hospital.  Pape was treated for his gunshot wound, however his condition eventually took a turn for the worse.  Doctors were unable to transfuse blood into him because of his collapsed veins.

Pape died at 2:40pm on April 30.  He was buried at [[Linwood Cemetery (Dubuque)|Linwood Cemetery]] in Dubuque.  Pape&amp;apos;s badge number 40 was retired from service.

The death of Pape is one of the main reasons the Patrol began the practice of &amp;quot;cross drawing&amp;quot; guns.  In this practice, officers wear their guns opposite their strong arm. In theory, an officer would be able to hold on to a person with their strong arm and be able to draw their weapon at the same time.
