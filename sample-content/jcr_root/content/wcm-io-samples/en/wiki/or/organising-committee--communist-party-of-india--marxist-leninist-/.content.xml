&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Organizing Committee, Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a communist organization in [[India]]. It was led by B.N. Sharma. Also known as the Bihar-Bengal Committee, CPI(ML).

OCCPI(ML) were in a close cooperation with [[UCCRI(ML)]]. There had been a period of cooperation between the two organizations on trade union solidarity. Discussions were taking place on forming joint students fronts, etc.. But the process was interrupted when the Bengal committee of UCCRI(ML) got entangled in a fractional conflict.

In 1988 OCCPI(ML) merged with four other groups to form [[Centre of Communist Revolutionaries of India]].
