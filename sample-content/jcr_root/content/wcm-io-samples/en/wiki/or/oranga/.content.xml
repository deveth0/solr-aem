&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oranga&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small residential [[suburb]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. It is located nine kilometres to the southeast of the city centre, between the commercial suburbs of [[Te Papapa]] and [[Penrose, New Zealand|Penrose]] to the south and east, and the residential suburbs of [[One Tree Hill, New Zealand|One Tree Hill]] and [[Onehunga]] to the north and south, with which it is frequently confused. The name is from a Maori word, Oranga (noun) - meaning &amp;apos;survivor, food, livelihood, welfare, health, living&amp;apos; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.maoridictionary.co.nz]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

It used to be a [[state housing]] neighbourhood for low-income families, but it is rapidly gentrifying. Private investors have bought up many of the state houses for renovation, and to subdivide their generous [[Yard (land)|sections]]. [[Real estate]] agents increasingly advertise these houses as belonging to the wealthier suburb of One Tree Hill.

Local facilities include Oranga Kindergarten (neighbouring Fergusson Domain), and Oranga Primary School.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.oranga.school.nz Oranga Primary School]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The local Secondary schools are [[One Tree Hill College]], [[Marcellin College, New Zealand|Marcellin College]] and [[St Peter&amp;apos;s College, Auckland|St Peter&amp;apos;s College]].
