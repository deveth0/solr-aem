&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Orleans&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a short-lived [[United States|American]] [[Dramatic programming|drama series]] that aired on [[CBS]] from January 7, 1997 through April 10, 1997. It ran for only 8 episodes. The series was said to be inspired by the experiences of creater producer Toni Graphia, who was the daughter of a Louisiana judge.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946â€“Present]]|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-45542-8|pages=892}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Synopsis==
The show was centered around the character of Judge Luther Charbonnet, portrayed by [[Larry Hagman]]. He was a judge seated in [[New Orleans]] and had a family that consisted of some wildly different characters. One of the sons was an assistant [[district attorney]], another son was a police officer, and a daughter who ran a [[casino]]. An overall backstory to the series was that Judge Luther had another daughter who was missing or had been dead for years, and he had a search going on for information on her. Several &amp;quot;taboo&amp;quot; subjects were touched on this series, including interracial relationships (Judge Luther had a black girlfriend) and [[incest]] (the daughter had a relationship with her cousin).

The show was promoted pretty heavily before it had aired, and even originally had the old timeslot that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; did during its run. However, the ratings were not great, and it got moved around in the schedule, presumably contributing to its quick downfall.

To date, it has not been repeated anywhere outside its original run nor released on home video in any form.
