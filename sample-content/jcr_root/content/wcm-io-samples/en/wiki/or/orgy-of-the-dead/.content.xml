&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Orgy of the Dead&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an unrated 1965 film directed by [[Stephen C. Apostolof]] under the alias  [[A. C. Stephen]]. The screenplay was adapted by cult film director [[Edward D. Wood, Jr]] from his own novel. It is a combination of [[Horror film|horror]] and [[erotic film|erotica]], and is something of a transition for Wood, who began as a horror writer and later wrote [[pornography]].

==Plot summary==
The film&amp;apos;s graveyard prologue is a recreation of the opening scene from Ed Wood&amp;apos;s then-unreleased 1958 film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Night of the Ghouls]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Criswell reprises his role from the earlier film.  The action begins when a young couple, Bob (William Bates) and Shirley ([[sexploitation]] actress [[Pat Barrington]], billed as Pat Barringer) survive a car crash only to find themselves tied to posts in a misty cemetery where they are forced to watch dead spirits dance for the Emperor of the Night played by [[The Amazing Criswell|Criswell]] (best known for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Plan 9 From Outer Space]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). Ten [[striptease]] performances by topless dancers from beyond the grave outfitted in various motifs comprise most of this movie. [[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]] (wearing a very obvious mask) and [[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]] are also tossed in for [[comic relief]]. Barrington doubles as the blond Gold Girl (inspired by [[Shirley Eaton]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) while her red-headed &amp;quot;Shirley&amp;quot; character watches her perform. Criswell&amp;apos;s [[undead]] consort, the sexy Black Ghoul, was written for [[Maila Nurmi]], a.k.a. Vampira, but was instead played by Fawn Silver, who wore a black bouffant wig.

==Production==
Wood served as writer, production manager, casting agent, and even held up cue cards on this low-budget film, although he did not direct. An article on the making of this film was published in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Femme Fatales (magazine)|Femme Fatales]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 7:1 (June 1998).
