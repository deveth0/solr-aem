&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Orotic acid&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[heterocyclic compound]] and an [[acid]]; it is also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;pyrimidinecarboxylic acid&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  Historically it was believed to be part of the [[Vitamin B]] complex and was called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;vitamin B13&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but it is now known that it is not a [[vitamin]].

The compound is manufactured in the body via a mitochondrial enzyme, [[dihydroorotate dehydrogenase]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Rawls J. et al. (2000) Requirements for the mitochondrial import and localization of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. Eur. J. Biochem.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; or a cytoplasmic enzyme of [[Pyrimidine metabolism|pyrimidine synthesis pathway]]. It is sometimes used as a [[mineral carrier]] in some [[dietary supplements]] (to increase their [[bioavailability]]), most commonly for [[lithium orotate]].

==Synthesis of orotate==
[[Dihydroorotate]] is synthesized to orotic acid by the [[enzyme]] dihydroorate dehydrogenase, where it later combines with [[phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate]] (PRPP) to form [[Orotidine 5&amp;apos;-monophosphate|orotidine-5&amp;apos;-monophosphate]] (OMP). A distinguishing characteristic of [[pyrimidine synthesis]] is that the pyrimidine ring is fully synthesized before being attached to the [[ribose sugar]], whereas purine synthesis happens by building the base directly on the sugar.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Lippincott. Biochemistry 4th Edition. 2008&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Orotic acid diseases==
A buildup of orotic acid can lead to [[orotic acidemia and aciduria]]. It may be a symptom of an increased [[ammonia]] load due to a [[metabolic disorder]], such as a [[urea cycle disorder]].

In [[ornithine transcarbamoylase deficiency]], an X-linked inherited  and the most common urea cycle disorder, excess carbamoyl phosphate is converted into orotic acid. This leads to an increased serum ammonia level, increased serum and urinary orotic acid levels and a decreased serum [[BUN]] level. This also leads to an increased urinary orotic acid excretion, because the orotic acid is not being properly utilized and must be eliminated. The hyperammonemia depletes alpha-ketoglutarate leading to the inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) decreasing ATP production.

Orotic acid can be mutagenic (causes [[mutation]]s) in mammalian somatic cells. It is also mutagenic for bacteria and or yeast.
