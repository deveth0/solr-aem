The original &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Orange SPV&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Smartphone was built by [[High Tech Computer Corporation]] for the European mobile operator, [[Orange SA|Orange]]. Powered by [[Microsoft]] [[Smartphone]] 2002, and launched late 2002, SPV stood for Sound, Pictures, Video, with the emphasis being on the devices multimedia capabilities and potential.

It came with a [[Texas Instruments]] [[Texas Instruments OMAP|OMAP710]] processor which clocked in at a speed of 132 MHz. An internal memory of 16 MB RAM and 32 MB of Flash ROM was complemented with the addition of a [[Secure Digital]] storage card.

It was most notable as being the first [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] powered [[smartphone]] to be released and was greeted with much anticipation. The phone carried mini versions of such desktop applications as Outlook, Media Player and [[Internet Explorer]] alongside advanced calendar, task and contact management facilities.

As a result it had as one of its most important target markets the largely overlooked business user segment.

Another of the main selling points of the phone at the time was the display, which had a reflective TFT screen producing 65,000 colours at 176 x 220 pixels resolution. The one drawback to all this in models before the E200 was the lack of a built in camera, something that was becoming increasingly common and popular on much less capable phones.

With a length of 11 cm, width 4.5 cm and a depth of 2 cm, it weighed just 95 g.

More HTC-built Orange SPV phones have continued to be regularly released with the latest offering being the SPV E650/HTC Vox.
