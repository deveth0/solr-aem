[[Image:Cross of order of mountjoy.svg|thumb|upright|Cross of Knights of Montjoie]]
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Order of Mountjoy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-fr|Ordre de Montjoie}}, {{lang-es|Orden de Monte Gaudio}}) was a [[military order]] during the [[crusade]]s.

The period of the [[Crusades]] witnessed the rise of [[religious order]]s and Christian military orders. The order of Montjoie is mentioned in the thirteenth century as having been founded for the purpose of protecting Christian pilgrims in [[Iberian Peninsula]].  Its existence was brief, having been established c.1180 and united with the [[Order of Calatrava]] in 1221.

The order was founded by count [[Rodrigo Álvarez]] in the [[Holy Land]]. Rodrigo was from the order of Santiago, and had already established the order in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]] before establishing it in the [[kingdom of Jerusalem]] in the tower of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]]. The headquarters of the order was situated on [[Nabi Samwil|Montjoie]], the hill where the [[First Crusade|original crusaders]] had first seen Jerusalem, hence its name (&amp;quot;mountain of joy&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;mons gaudii&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Latin language|Latin]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mont de joie&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[French language|French]], contracted in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Montjoie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). The rule of the order was adapted from the [[Cistercian]] rule, and was entirely a [[Spain|Spanish]] order. The emblem of the order was a red and white cross.

A number of knights from the order fought at the [[Battle of Hattin]] in 1187, but none of them survived. Discontentment with the leadership of the master [[Fralmo]] in 1196 led to the establishment of a new [[Order of Monfragüe]] in Castile while the Aragonese element of the order was merged with Templars. In 1221 [[Ferdinand III of Castile]] joined the order of Monfragüe to the [[Order of Calatrava]]. The [[Order of Montesa]] was inspired partly by the suggestion to re-establish Montjoie after the suppression of the Templars.

This Order was also known as the Order of Trufac.
