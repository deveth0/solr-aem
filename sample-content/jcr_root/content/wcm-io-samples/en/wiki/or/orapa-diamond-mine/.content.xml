The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Orapa diamond mine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the world&amp;apos;s largest [[diamond]] [[mining|mine]]. The mine is located in [[Orapa]], a town in the Boteti Sub-District of [[Botswana]] about {{convert|240|km|mi|sp=us}} west of the city of [[Francistown]]. Orapa (&amp;quot;resting place for lions&amp;quot;) is owned by [[Debswana]], a [[partnership]] between the [[De Beers]] company and the government of Botswana. It is the oldest of four mines operated by the company, having begun operations in July 1971.

Orapa is of [[open pit]] construction and is the largest diamond mine in the world by area. The mine is located on two [[kimberlite]] [[volcanic pipe|pipes]] that converge near the surface, covering 1.18 square kilometres at ground level. Orapa operates seven days per week, and produces 20 million tons per year of [[ore]] and an additional 40 million tons per year of waste rock. Currently, the Orapa mine annually produces approximately 11 million [[Carat (unit)|carats]] (2200&amp;amp;nbsp;kg) of diamonds.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2013-02-04|url=http://www.resourceinvestor.com/2013/01/22/the-state-of-2013-global-rough-diamond-supply|title=The state of 2013 global rough diamond supply|publisher=Resource Investor|date=January 22, 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The recoverable [[ore grade]] at the mine is about 0.87 carats (174&amp;amp;nbsp;mg) per ton. The mine was expanded in 1999, doubling its previous capacity. The processing plant at Orapa processes the ore produced at Orapa as well as two of Debswana&amp;apos;s three other mines, the [[Letlhakane diamond mine|Letlhakane]] and [[Damtshaa diamond mine]]s.

Orapa and its sister mine Letlhakane employ over 3,100. Debswana also maintains a 100-bed [[hospital]], pre-primary and primary schools for employees&amp;apos; children, and the [[Orapa game park]]. The mine maintains an [[ISO 14001]] certificate for environmental compliance, and places some importance on [[water conservation]] and [[waste management]].
