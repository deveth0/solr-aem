&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yuri Fyodorovich Lisyansky&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also spelled as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Urey Lisiansky&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lisianski&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lysyansky&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) ({{lang-ua|Юрій Федорович Лисянський &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jurij Fedorovyč Lysjanskyj&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}, {{lang-ru|Юрий Фёдорович Лисянский &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jurij Fëdorovič Lisjanskij&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}, 13 August 1773&amp;amp;mdash;6 March 1837) was an officer in the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and [[explorer]] of Ukrainian origin.

Lisyansky was born in [[Nizhyn]] (now [[Ukraine]], then [[Russian Empire]]) in the family of the orthodox priest and was a descendant of old [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossack]] family. In 1786 he graduated from the [[Navy Cadet Corps]] and took part in the [[Russo-Swedish War (1788-1790)]]. During 1790-1793 he served in the [[Baltic Fleet]]. During 1793-1799 he sailed British ships all over the globe. Between 1793 and 1795 he served as a volunteer aboard the 36-gun [[French frigate Cléopâtre|HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oiseau&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], under her captain, [[Robert Murray (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Murray]]. Lisyansky recalled in his memoirs his experiences on the [[North American Station]] operating against French convoys and privateers, and how while in the [[West Indies]] he was struck by [[yellow fever]], recalling how Murray had helped his recovery, even giving up part of his own accommodation for the sick Lisyansky.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Lisyansky&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |last=Lisyansky|title=A Voyage Round the World in 1803, 4, 5 &amp;amp; 6 ... in the Ship Neva|pages=xvii-xviii}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1803-1806 Lisyanski as the commanding officer of the [[sloop-of-war]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Neva (Russian warship)|Neva]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; took part in the first Russian [[circumnavigation]] of the [[Earth]] headed by [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Krusenstern]]. They started from [[Kronstadt]], but the ships split after visiting [[Hawaii]] and Lisianski headed to [[Russian America|Russian America (Alaska)]]. In 1804 the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Neva&amp;apos;&amp;apos; visited [[Easter Island]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Katherine Routledge]] refers to page 58 of his book - Voyage round the world in the Ship &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Neva&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Lisiansky, London 1814.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and later that year, was essential in defeating the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] in the [[Battle of Sitka]], Alaska. In 1805 he met Krusenstern again in [[Macau]], but they soon separated. Also in 1805, he was the first to describe the [[Hawaiian monk seal]] on the island which now bears his name.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.monachus-guardian.org/factfiles/hawai01.htm Monachus Guardian]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Eventually, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Neva&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the first to return to Kronstadt on 22 July 1806. For this feat Lisyanski was awarded in various ways, including the decoration with the [[Order of Saint Vladimir]] of 3rd degree.
