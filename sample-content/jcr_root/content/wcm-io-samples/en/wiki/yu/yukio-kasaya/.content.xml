&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yukio Kasaya&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (笠谷 幸生 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kasaya Yukio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, born August 17, 1943 in [[Yoichi, Hokkaido]]) is a former Japanese [[ski jumping|ski jumper]]. He was one of the most successful ski jumpers of the late 1960s and the early 1970s. At the [[1970 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships]] at [[Vysoké Tatry (town)|Vysoké Tatry]], [[Czechoslovakia]], he finished second in the individual normal hill behind [[Gariy Napalkov]] ([[Soviet Union]]).  At the 1971/72 [[Four Hills Tournament]], he won the first three jumping events and would probably have won the overall combined tournament.  However, before jumping in the last event at [[Bischofshofen]], he returned to [[Japan]] in order to prepare for the [[1972 Winter Olympics]], which took place in [[Sapporo]].  There he won the gold medal in the individual normal hill, where Japan won all three medals.  In 1972 the Olympic Games also doubled as the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships]], so Kasaya&amp;apos;s gold medal victory in the individual normal hill made him world champion as well.

As Japan&amp;apos;s first ever Winter Olympic gold medalist, Kasaya is a national hero.
