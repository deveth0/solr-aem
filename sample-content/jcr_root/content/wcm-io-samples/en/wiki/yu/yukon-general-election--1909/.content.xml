        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;1909 Yukon general election&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was held on 28 June 1909 to elect the ten members of the [[Yukon Legislative Assembly|Yukon Territorial Council]]. The Council was non-partisan and had merely an advisory role to the federally appointed [[Commissioner#Canadian territories|Commissioner]]. The 1909 election marked the first time that voters in the territory elected the entire council â€” in the four prior elections, the council was composed of five elected representatives and five representatives appointed by the Canadian federal government.
