&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yue He&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a fictional character in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Water Margin]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, one of the [[Four Great Classical Novels]] of [[Chinese literature]]. He ranks 77th of the 108 Liangshan heroes and 41st of the 72 Earthly Fiends. He is nicknamed &amp;quot;Iron Whistle&amp;quot;.

==Background==
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Water Margin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; describes Yue He as a handsome gentleman from Maozhou (present-day [[Mouding County]], [[Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture|Chuxiong]], [[Yunnan]]). He has a talent for music and is able to play various types of musical instruments and sing very well, earning himself the nickname &amp;quot;Iron Whistle&amp;quot;. Yue He is also highly intelligent and possesses an innate ability to foresee the outcome of events. He learnt martial arts from his distant relative [[Sun Li (Water Margin)|Sun Li]].

==Becoming an outlaw==
Yue He works as a prison warder in Dengzhou (in present-day [[Shandong]]). The Xie brothers ([[Xie Zhen]] and [[Xie Bao]]) are framed and imprisoned to await execution. Yue He sympathises with their plight and decides to help them. He goes to inform their cousin [[Gu Dasao]] and her husband [[Sun Xin (Water Margin)|Sun Xin]] (Sun Li&amp;apos;s younger brother). Yue He works together with Sun Li, Sun Xin, Gu Dasao, [[Zou Run]] and [[Zou Yuan]] to raid the prison and rescue the Xie brothers. They travel to [[Mount Liang|Liangshan Marsh]] to join the outlaw band after that. At that time, the outlaws are in the midst of a war with the Zhu Family Village. Yue He joins Sun Li and the new members of Liangshan to conduct an espionage mission in the village and help the outlaws defeat the Zhus.

==Campaigns==
Yue He becomes one of the leaders of the Liangshan infantry and a scout leader after the Grand Assembly. The outlaws defeat an imperial fleet led by Grand Marshal [[Gao Qiu]] and capture Gao. Gao Qiu agrees to help the outlaws obtain amnesty from the [[Emperor Huizong of Song|emperor]] and is released. Yue He and [[Xiao Rang]] follow Gao Qiu back to the capital as envoys to the emperor. Unfortunately, Gao Qiu breaks his promise and imprisons Yue He and Xiao Rang in his residence. They are rescued by [[Yan Qing]] and [[Dai Zong]] later.

The outlaws are granted amnesty eventually with the help of [[Li Shishi (Song Dynasty)|Li Shishi]] and other officials and the emperor allows them to go on military campaigns against the [[Liao Dynasty|Liao]] invaders and rebel forces, as a form of service to the nation. Yue He follows the heroes on these campaigns and contributes greatly to the victories. However, he does not participate in the [[Fang La]] campaign as he is summoned back to the capital on the eve of the campaign. A prince consort has heard of Yue He&amp;apos;s singing talent and he wants Yue to serve him as a minstrel. Yue He leads a happy life for the rest of his days in the prince consort&amp;apos;s residence.
