        text="&lt;p&gt;[[Image:YUKTHIVADI.JPG|thumb|align=left|200px|Issue of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yukthivadi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; dated 4.4.1936]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yukthivadi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  (The Rationalist) was the first  rationalist/atheist journal published in [[Malayalam]].  The contribution made by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yukthivadi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to the renaissance of [[Kerala]], [[India]] is phenomenal.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yukthivadi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; started its publication in August 1929 from [[Ernakulam]] under the editorial board of [[M. Ramavarma Thampan]], [[C. Krishnan]], [[C. V. Kunhiraman]], [[Sahodaran Ayyappan]] and [[M.C. Joseph]].  In a statement published in the first issue of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yukthivadi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Sahodaran K. Ayyappan wrote:
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rationalism is not a religion. It is an attitude to accept knowledge based upon reason.   &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yukthivadi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; will attempt to generate such an attitude amongst the people.  To do this, we will have to criticize irrational faiths and propagate rational knowledge.  Since &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yukthivadi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; does not believe in any ultimate knowledge, it will not hesitate to correct itself based upon the latest information and knowledge.  Every rationalist is bound to do so.  The only maxim that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yukthivadi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; accepts as unchangeable is that the knowledge should be based upon reason&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In spite of the fact that all of the editorial board members were well known social activists, the conservative [[Kerala]] welcomed its publication with the expected derision. Even such a well known personality as [[Moorkoth Kumaran]] did not hesitate to pen a poem denigrating the publishers.  Not surprisingly, a meeting of a religious sect passed a resolution cursing the publishers of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yukthivadi&amp;apos;!

In August 1931 M.C.Joseph became its sole editor-publisher and shifted the publication to [[Irinjalakkuda]].  For the next forty five  years until June 1974 M.C.Joseph brought out the magazine without any interruption.  In July 1974, because of his failing health (he was 87 then),  he handed over the magazine to Unni Kakkanad, who published it for yet another decade before it ceased publication&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;[[#Notes|1]]&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;.

The vibrant rationalist movement that is seen in Kerala today is undoubtedly the direct consequence of the ideas spread by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yukthivadi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for more than half a century.

==Notes==

# An attempt was made in the 1990s by the late [[C.G.Jayashankar]], a [[Trissur]] based rationalist activist, to revive the magazine. But it was wound up after bringing out a few issues.
