His life spanned nearly the whole of the [[Wanli]] period (1573-1620) in Chinese history. Yuan was from Gong&amp;apos;an in Hukuang.　His family had been military officials for generations. Yuan showed an interest in literature from youth and formed his own literary club at age fifteen. At the age of twenty-four in 1592 he took the [[chin-shih examination ]] and subsequently received an official position in 1595. However he quit out of boredom after a year. Yuan traveled and consulted with the radical philosopher [[Li Zhi (philosopher)|Li Zhi]]. On another trip his brothers joined him. Hu&amp;apos;s elder brother was a Buddhist-Confucianist synchronist. His travels resulted in his publishing a poetry compilation &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Jietuo ji]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [Collection of One Released]. His and his two brothers&amp;apos; poetry, which focused on clarity and sincerity, produced a following eventually known as the Gong&amp;apos;an school, the central belief of which was that good writing was a result of genuine emotions and personal experience. When one of his brothers died in 1600, Yuan retired to a small island in a lake to meditate and write poetry. The resulting work is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Xiaobi tangji]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [Jade-Green Bamboo Hall Collection].

== Poems ==

THE CAPITAL

Bright are the city walls of the capital;

Red-robed officials shout on broad streets.

There is a white-headed destitute scholar;

Hanging from his mule&amp;apos;s saddle, sheaves of poems.

Clasping his calling card, he knocks on doors for work;

The gate keepers smirk at one another.

Ten try and ten fail;

Walk the streets, his face is haggard.

Always fear in serving the rich;

Sorry your flattery isn&amp;apos;t quick enough.

Over an eye a black eyepatch;

Half blind, the fellow is old!

A STRANGE PRIEST

Bought his mantle to escape draft and taxes;

Now he&amp;apos;s the head priest amid his splendor.

Recites incantations, but sounds like a bird;

Writes Sanscrit that looks like twisted weeds.

With his begging bowl he distributes food of the spirit;

On his seat he faces the lamp of Buddha;

If you don&amp;apos;t devote you whole body and soul,

How can there be anywhere Buddhism at all?
