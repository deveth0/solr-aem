[[File:Georg-kathedral-yp.jpg|thumb|St.&amp;amp;nbsp;George&amp;apos;s Cathedral (1230-1234) was the last stone church built in Russia before the Mongol invasion]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yuryev-Polsky&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Ю́рьев-По́льский}}) is an old [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|town]] and the [[administrative center]] of [[Yuryev-Polsky District]] of [[Vladimir Oblast]], [[Russia]], located in the upper reaches of the [[Koloksha River]], {{convert|68|km|sp=us}} northwest of [[Vladimir]]. Population: {{ru-census2010|19,595|;}} {{ru-census2002|19,906|;}} {{su-census1989|22,247|;}} 23,000 (1974).

==History==
It was founded by [[Yury Dolgoruky]] in 1152.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} First part of its name derives from Yury&amp;apos;s patron saint, [[Saint George|St.&amp;amp;nbsp;George]]. The second part is derived from the word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;polsky&amp;apos;&amp;apos; meaning &amp;quot;in the fields&amp;quot; (see [[zalesye|opolye]] for details). This specification was needed in order to distinguish the town from the earlier established fortress of Yuryev (nowadays [[Tartu]]), at the time located in the woods in what is now [[Estonia]] and then the biggest Russian settlement in the territory of the [[Chud]]s.

Upon [[Vsevolod the Big Nest|Vsevolod III]]&amp;apos;s death in 1212, the town was assigned to one of his youngest sons, [[Sviatoslav Vsevolodovich of Vladimir|Sviatoslav]]. It was that prince who personally designed the town&amp;apos;s chief landmark, the [[Saint George Cathedral, Yuryev-Polsky|Cathedral of St.&amp;amp;nbsp;George]] (1230–1234). It is the latest pre-Mongol construction in Russia, unprecedented in abundance of stone sculptures, and also the model for first stone churches in the [[Moscow Kremlin]]. In the 1460s, the cathedral&amp;apos;s dome collapsed, thus burying most of unique sculptures which had adorned the cathedral walls. The collapsed roof was sloppily restored by a well-known Muscovite artisan, [[Vasili Yermolin]], in 1471.

The great [[Battle of Lipitsa]] was fought near the town in 1216. In 1238, Yuriev was sacked by the [[Mongols]]. A century later, it was incorporated into [[Muscovy]]. The chief monument of the Muscovite period is the walled Monastery of [[Archangel Michael]], originally founded in the 13th century and containing [[:Image:Юрьев-Польский.jpg|various buildings from the 17th and 18th centuries]]. Several miles from Yuryev, on the bank of the [[Yakhroma River]], stands the [http://www.sobory.ru/pic/00200/00205_20050502_202833.jpg Kosmin Cloister], whose structures are typical for the mid-17th century.
