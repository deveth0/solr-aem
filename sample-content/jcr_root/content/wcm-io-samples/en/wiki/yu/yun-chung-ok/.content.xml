&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yun Chung-Ok&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Korea]]n [[scholar]] and [[activist]] whose investigations into [[Japan]]ese [[war]] [[slavery]] during [[World War II]] led to the creation of The [[Korea]]n Council for the Women Drafted for Military Slavery by Japan. Working with two other members of the group Korea Church Women United, Kim Hye Won and Kim Sin Sil, Yun created and conducted the &amp;quot;Military Sexual Slavery by Japan on-the-Spot Survey&amp;quot;.

Yun frequently quoted from &amp;quot;Military Comfort woman&amp;quot; written by [[Kakou Senda]] as &amp;quot;200,000 Korean women were forced to be sex slave&amp;quot;, however Senda wrote &amp;quot;200,000 women were forced to work for military factory, and 50,000～70,000 women out of them were forced to be Comfort Women.&amp;quot; Yun also quoted from Senda as &amp;quot;200,000 Korean women forced to be Military Comfort Woman&amp;quot;, however Senda wrote &amp;quot;50,000～70,000 women were Korean out of 200,000 women forced to work for military factory.&amp;quot;
