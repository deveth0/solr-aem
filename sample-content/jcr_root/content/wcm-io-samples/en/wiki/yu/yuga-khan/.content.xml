==Fictional character biography==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yuga Khan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]].  He first appeared in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[New Gods]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; volume 2 #17 (June 1990). Khan was the former [[patriarch]] of [[Apokolips]] and its first ruler, whose misguided attempt to unravel the unknowable mystery of [[Source (comics)|the Source]] left him a helpless captive for countless thousands of years. Yuga Khan&amp;apos;s wife [[Heggra]] later died by the machinations of their son Uxas, known more prominently by the name [[Darkseid]], who took control of Apokolips himself.

(New Gods II #17-21) - In The [[Promethean]] [[Galaxy]] Yuga Khan broke his bonds, and consumed the [[planet]] [[Velos]]. His return to living existence constituted a greater threat to life than even his son Darkseid. Khan next destroyed a [[Thanagarian]] [[probe station]], which attracted the attention of [[Lar Gand]], who managed to save the lives of a few [[Thanagarians]]. After draining another world and gaining more strength, Khan came to Apokolips.

For the first time in his life, Darkseid knew fear despite his bravado of claiming Khan was the past and he was the future. Khan restrained him and sarcastically asked if he was going to hug his father. Khan reclaimed his rulership over Apokolips, making life twice as hard on the populace. Desaad pledged his loyalty to him, telling him his service to Darkseid had been a lie. Khan reminded him that heâ€™d poisoned his beloved wife Heggra and disintegrated him there. Khan cut off the Source, rendering Boom Tubes and Mother Boxes inoperative. He would continue his quest to find the nature of the Source, no matter the casualties. Commander Gideon launched an invasion of Apokolips, however Khan devastated his New Genesis soldiers and killed Gideon. Yuga Khan once again turned his attention to the Source Wall, where Highfather tried to stop him, warning him of the limits of godhood. Khan ignored him, subsequently transforming his body into primal energy so he could enter the Source. His second attempt was no more successful than his first, he was once again imprisoned in the Promethean Galaxy.

==Powers and abilities==
Yuga Khan was the most powerful New God. He possessed enormous physical prowess, the ability to traverse [[hypertime]] and could even manipulate The Source itself to an extent. His most dangerous ability was that he could drain the life force of individuals or planets, adding to his own formidable power.

A proper measure of his might was the fact that Darkseid himself dared not face him.
