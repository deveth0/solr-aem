&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stadion Yuvileiny&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ua|Стадiон Ювiлейний}}, {{lang-ru|Стадион Юбилейный}} &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stadion Yubilejny&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[football (soccer)|football]]-only [[stadium]] located at 9 Gagarin street, [[Sumy]], [[Ukraine]] 40030. The stadium comprises an area of {{convert|5.1782|ha|acre}}.

Stadion Yuvileiny is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches, and is the previous home of the now-defunct [[FC Spartak Sumy]]. The ownership of the stadium currently belongs to the city after the partnership owning Spartak went into bankruptcy. The stadium holds 25,830 people and was built in 2001.

[[FC Kharkiv]], from the [[Ukrainian Premier League]] leased the stadium for the 2008-09 season.

==History==
The stadium broke ground in late 1999 and in two years was opened. Originally it was constructed for the Spartak Sumy that at that time competed in the [[Ukrainian First League]] with the perspective for the club advancing to the national premiers.

According to the official website of PFC Sumy the rate of the stadium&amp;apos;s construction was never seen before: &amp;quot;расчетных темпов строительства не знало до сих пор еще ни одно строение&amp;quot;. The website also claims that work was conducted without breaks for holidays. The financial support for the construction was given from such big Ukrainian companies as [[Naftogaz Ukrainy]] with its &amp;quot;[[Ukrnafta]]&amp;quot; and the regional representative in the face of &amp;quot;Okhtyrkanaftogaz&amp;quot;.

The territory of the stadium is {{convert|1|ha|acre}}, while the constructed territory rounds to {{convert|15960|m2|sqft}}. The drainage system and the field-heating system was installed by &amp;quot;Eleter&amp;quot; ([[Kiev]]), while the stadium lighting is ensured by &amp;quot;Vatra&amp;quot;.

The administrative building is 106.4 м by 14.9 м, while the training hall is {{convert|164.2|m2|sqft}}.
