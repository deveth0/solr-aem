&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yurtec Stadium Sendai&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ユアテックスタジアム仙台) is a [[football (soccer)|football]] stadium in the Nanakita Park, Izumi-ku, [[Sendai|Sendai City]], [[Miyagi Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. It was built in 1997 and is home to the [[J. League]] club [[Vegalta Sendai]] and the [[Japan Football League]] club [[Sony Sendai F.C.]]. The stadium was specifically designed for football, and the stands are arranged close to the pitch. For games where the spectator capacity is insufficient, nearby [[Miyagi Stadium]] is occasionally used as a substitute.

==History==

The naming rights for the stadium were sold beginning on March 1, 2006 until February 28, 2009.  In that period, the stadium is officially known as {{Nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yurtec STADIUM SENDAI&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|ユアテックスタジアム仙台|Yuatekku Sutajiamu Sendai}}.

In 2009, the turf were replaced, and Vegalta played the first half of the season at Miyagi Stadium.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kahoku.co.jp/spe/spe106/news_spe/news20080408_001.htm|title=仙台―広島戦宮スタが会場|publisher=河北新報|date=2008-04-08|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-04-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The stadium was damaged after the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |title=Japan cancels all March games in top soccer league |author= |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110314/ap_on_sp_so_ne/soc_earthquake_soccer_suspension;_ylt=Ak8A6VqFUi6zDeHDN9RZTroLMxIF;_ylu=X3oDMTMxYXFyMHVnBGFzc2V0A2FwLzIwMTEwMzE0L3NvY19lYXJ0aHF1YWtlX3NvY2Nlcl9zdXNwZW5zaW9uBGNwb3MDMwRwb3MDNQRzZWMDeW5fdG9wX3N0b3J5BHNsawNqYXBhbmNhbmNlbHM- |newspaper=Yahoo!

== International Matches ==
===Football===

[[Italy national football team|Italy]] used the stadium as their base for training camp during the [[Football World Cup 2002|2002 World Cup]], and cast images of the team members footprints are on display outside the stadium.

Italy, France  [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], and [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] have participated, along with the hosts, [[Japan national football team|Japan]].

Exhibition matches between Vegalta Sendai and [[A.C. ChievoVerona]] and [[S.S. Lazio]] have been played at Sendai Stadium as well.  The match with Chievo in 2003 was the final club game for [[Oliver Bierhoff]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerway.com/news/2003/june/4/japan-stars-tune-up-for-internationals/?print=yes|title=Japan stars tune up for internationals|publisher=Soccerway|date=2004-06-03|accessdate=2008-04-08}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

===Rugby===

On June 16, 2007 the stadium was the venue for [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]] vs. [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]] in the [[2007 IRB Pacific Nations Cup]]. It was the first time an international rugby game had been played in the [[Tōhoku region]].

On June 15, 2008 Japan defeated [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]] 35-13 at the stadium in the [[2008 IRB Pacific Nations Cup]].
