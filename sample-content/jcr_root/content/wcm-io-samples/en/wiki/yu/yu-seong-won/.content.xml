&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yu Seong-won&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ryu Seong-won&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (died 1456) was a scholar-official of the early [[Joseon Dynasty]], who is remembered as one of the [[six murdered ministers]].  He was born to a [[yangban]] family of the [[Munhwa Ryu]] lineage, but his date of birth is not known.

Yu passed the lower examination 1444 and the higher examination in 1447.  He was shortly thereafter appointed to the [[Hall of Worthies]] by [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|Sejong]].  Yu was among the compilers of the first edition of the [[Classified Collection of Medical Prescriptions]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;yu bang yu chwi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 醫方類聚), together with other members of the Hall of Worthies.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|url=http://medhist.kams.or.kr/index.asp?body=1999187a|title=Authors of the Classified Collection of Medical Prescriptions|work=Korean Journal of Medical History 8(2)|author=Shin, Soon Shik|accessdate=2006-04-09|year=1999}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1455, [[Sejo of Joseon|Sejo]] overthrew the reigning king [[Danjong of Joseon|Danjong]].  Yu joined with other high officials in a conspiracy to restore Danjong to the throne.  This was discovered by the king shortly before it was to happen, and Yu committed suicide.

Yu&amp;apos;s tomb lies today in [[Sayuksin Park]] in [[Noryangjin-dong]], [[Dongjak-gu]], [[Seoul]].  It was moved there in the 1970s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.dongjak.go.kr/pub/eng/eng.jsp?sc=eng03010401 Welcome to Dongjak-gu&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
