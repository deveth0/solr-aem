&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yury Osipovich  Dombrovsky&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Ю́рий О́сипович Домбро́вский}}) (May 12, 1909 - May 29, 1978) was a [[Russian literature|Russian writer]] who spent nearly eighteen years in Soviet prison camps and exile.

==Life and career==
Dombrovsky was the son of Jewish lawyer Joseph Hedal Dombrovsky [http://www.informprostranstvo.ru/N3_2006/lica_3_2006.html] and Russian mother. Yury fell foul of the authorities as early as 1932, for his part in the student suicide case described in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Faculty of Useless Knowledge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He was exiled to [[Alma-Ata]] in [[Kazakhstan]] where he established himself as a teacher, and which provided the setting for his novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Keeper of Antiquities&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This work, translated into English by [[Michael Glenny]], gives several ominous hints as to the development of the Stalinist terror and its impact in remote Alma-Ata.

Dombrovsky had begun publishing literary articles in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kazakhstanskaya Pravda&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by 1937, when he was imprisoned again&amp;amp;nbsp;— this time for a mere seven months, having the luck to be detained during the partial hiatus between the downfall of [[Nikolay Yezhov|Yezhov]] and the appointment of [[Lavrenty Beria|Beria]].

Dombrovsky&amp;apos;s first novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Derzhavin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was published in 1938 and he was accepted into the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] in 1939, the year in which he was arrested yet again. This time he was sent to the notorious [[Kolyma]] camps in northeast Siberia, of which we are given brief but chilling glimpses in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Faculty of Useless Knowledge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Dombrovsky, partially paralysed, was released from the camps in 1943 and lived as a teacher in Alma-Ata until 1949. There he wrote &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Monkey Comes for his Skull&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Dark Lady&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 1949, he was again arrested, this time in connection with the campaign against foreign influences and cosmopolitanism.  This time, he received a ten-year sentence, to be served in the [[Tayshet]] and Osetrovo regions in [[Siberia]].

In 1955, he was released and fully rehabilitated the following year. Until his death in 1978, he lived in Moscow with Klara Fazulayevna (a character in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Faculty of Useless Knowledge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). He was allowed to write, and his works were translated abroad, but none of them were re-issued in the USSR. Nor was he allowed abroad, even to Poland.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Faculty of Useless Knowledge&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Harvill), translated by [[Alan Myers (translator)|Alan Myers]] the sombre and chilling sequel to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Keeper of Antiquities&amp;apos;&amp;apos; took eleven years to write, and was published in Paris in 1978.

A widespread opinion {{citation needed|fact=December 2010|date=December 2010}} is that this publication proved fatal. The [[KGB]] did not approve of the work, and it was noted that the book had actually been finished in 1975. Dombrovsky received numerous threats over the phone and through the post; his arm was shattered by a steel pipe in the course of an assault on a bus, and he was finally attacked and severely beaten in the House of Literature. He died about a month and a half later.

An account about Dombrovsky written by [[Armand Maloumian]], a fellow inmate of the GULAG, can be found in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kontinent 4: Contemporary Russian Writers&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Avon Books, ed. George Bailey), entitled &amp;quot;And Even Our Tears.&amp;quot;
