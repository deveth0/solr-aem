The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;King David Kalakaua Building&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] is a government building formerly known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;U.S. Post Office, Customhouse, and Courthouse&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  It was the official seat of administration in the [[Territory of Hawaii]] and state of [[Hawaii]] for the [[United States]] [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].

==Federal building==
The building was designed in 1918 and built from 1921 to 1922 in [[Mission/Spanish Revival architecture]]. An addition was added in 1929, and opened in 1931.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;focus&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |title= U.S. Post Office, Customhouse, and Courthouse nomination form |author= Randall J. Biallas and Gerron S.

Among other functions, it held courtrooms and offices for the [[United States District Court for the District of Hawaii]].

It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) on January 27, 1975, under the former name as site 75000620.  In 1978 it was also included as a [[contributing property]] in the NRHP listing of the [[Hawaii Capital Historic District]].&amp;lt;ref name=nris/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |title= Hawaii Capital Historic District nomination form |author= Dale M.

==State building==
In December 2003, the federal government sold most of the building to the state of Hawaii for [[US Dollar|US$]]32.5 million, upon which the building was renamed in honor of [[Kalākaua|King David Kalākaua]] &amp;amp;mdash; last king of the Hawaiian monarchy.  All federal agencies and departments moved their offices years earlier to the [[Prince Kuhio Federal Building]] near [[Honolulu Harbor]], except for a small section that retains a post office.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |title= Old post office assumes new role |newspaper= [[Honolulu Advertiser]] |date= December 30, 2003 |author= Gordon Y.K. Pang |url= http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2003/Dec/30/ln/ln29a.html |accessdate= April 2, 2011 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The building holds offices of the Hawaii state Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. It is located at 335 Merchant Street.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |title= Directory of Services |publisher= Hawaii state Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs |date= January 2010 |url= http://hawaii.gov/dcca/dcca_directory_of_services.pdf |accessdate= October 11, 2010 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
