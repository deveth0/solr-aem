&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kinderdijk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a village in the [[Netherlands]], belonging to the municipality of [[Molenwaard]], in the province [[South Holland]], about 15&amp;amp;nbsp;km east of [[Rotterdam]]. Kinderdijk is situated in a [[polder]] in the [[Alblasserwaard]] at the [[confluence]] of the [[Lek River|Lek]] and [[Noord River|Noord]] rivers. To drain the polder, a system of 19 [[windmill]]s was built around 1740. This group of mills is the largest concentration of old windmills in the Netherlands. The windmills of Kinderdijk are one of the best known Dutch tourist sites. They have been a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] since 1997.

==Name==
The name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kinderdijk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for &amp;quot;Children dike&amp;quot;. In 1421 during the [[St. Elizabeth&amp;apos;s flood (1421)|Saint Elizabeth flood of 1421]], the [[Grote Hollandse Waard]] flooded, but the Alblasserwaard [[polder]] stayed unflooded. It is said that when the terrible storm had subsided, someone went on to the [[Levee|dike]] between these two areas, to see what could be saved. In the distance, he saw a wooden [[Bassinet|cradle]] floating on the waters. As it came nearer, some movement was detected. A [[cat]] was seen in the cradle trying to keep it in [[Balance (ability)|balance]] by jumping back and forth so that no water could get into it. As the cradle eventually came close enough to the dike for a bystander to pick up the cradle, he saw that a [[baby]] was quietly sleeping inside it, nice and dry. The cat had kept the cradle balanced and afloat. This folktale and legend has been published as &amp;quot;The Cat and the Cradle&amp;quot; in English.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Meder 2007; Griffis, 1918.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
In [[Alblasserwaard]], problems with water became more and more apparent in the 13th century. Large canals, called &amp;quot;weteringen&amp;quot;, were dug to get rid of the excess water in the [[polder]]s. However, the drained soil started setting, while the level of the river rose due to the river&amp;apos;s sand deposits. After a few centuries, an additional way to keep the [[polder]]s dry was required. It was decided to build a series of windmills, with a limited capacity to bridge water level differences, but just able to pump water into a reservoir at an intermediate level between the soil in the polder and the river; the reservoir could be pumped out into the river by other windmills whenever the river level was low enough; the river level has both seasonal and tidal variations. Although some of the windmills are still used, the main water works are provided by two diesel pumping stations near one of the entrances of the windmills site.
