&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kimbolton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a large [[village]] in the [[Huntingdonshire]] district of [[Cambridgeshire]], [[England]].  It is approximately {{convert|7|mi|0}} east of [[Higham Ferrers]], {{convert|7|mi|0}} west of [[St Neots]] and {{convert|24|mi|0}} west of [[Cambridge]], {{convert|14|mi|0}} north of Bedford and {{convert|31|mi|0}} south of [[Peterborough]].

==Castle==
The centre of the village is [[Kimbolton Castle]] which now forms the main building of [[Kimbolton School]] (an independent day and  [[boarding school]]), but its predecessor on the same site was once home and prison to [[Katherine of Aragon]] after her divorce from [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Katherine died at Kimbolton Castle in 1536 and was transported from there to [[Peterborough Cathedral]] to be buried.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.britainexpress.com/counties/cambridgeshire/az/kimbolton.htm Britain Express]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
Kimbolton, and the lands of its [[Soke (legal)|soke]], comprised the only estate of [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold]] in Huntingdonshire. It is believed that Harold had a hunting lodge nearby. Kimbolton and its church, [[St Andrew]]&amp;apos;s, appear in the [[Domesday book]], compiled in 1086.

The main road through Kimbolton bends through four tight [[angle|right angle]]s in quick succession.  Originally, the road travelled directly through the outskirts of the village, nearer to the [[River Kym]] to the north.

==Statute Fair==
In 1200, a prominent local landowner, [[Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex|Geoffrey Fitz Peter]], [[Earl of Essex]] and [[Chief Justice]] to [[John of England|King John]], who constructed the first castle on the present site, received a [[Royal charter]] to hold a market and fair in Kimbolton. There is still a fair every September, known as the &amp;quot;Statute Fair&amp;quot; - referred to affectionately by locals as the &amp;quot;Statty&amp;quot;. Continuation of this fair (despite the chaos which formerly ensued when this meant partial closure of a trunk road) and a plaque marking the site of the market cross are claimed by some as evidence that Kimbolton is a town and still has a right to hold a weekly market. The main road was diverted to its present course to take it through the market place and increase toll revenue. 800 years later, as a result of numerous vehicles striking walls and houses near the sharp bends, car transporters are not allowed in the village.

==Facilities==
Kimbolton is known locally for its facilities, including High Street shopping, three public houses, a garage, fire station and the Mandeville Hall.

==Kimbolton Airfield==
In [[World War II]], the [[USAF]] [[379th Bombardment Group]] was stationed at the nearby [[Kimbolton Airfield]] from May 1943 to June 1945.

==Kimbolton Fireworks==
[[Kimbolton Fireworks]], a well-known manufacturer of fireworks and organiser of public fireworks displays, is based in Kimbolton.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.kimboltonfireworks.co.uk/ Kimbolton Fireworks]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It grew from the extracurricular activities of  Kimbolton School chaplain and chemistry master, Rev Ron Lancaster, sometimes dubbed the &amp;quot;master blaster pastor.&amp;quot;
