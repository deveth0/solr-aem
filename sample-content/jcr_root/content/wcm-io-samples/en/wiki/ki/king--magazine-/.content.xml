&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;King&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a monthly [[men&amp;apos;s magazine]] geared toward [[African American]] and [[urban area|urban]] audiences. It features articles about [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[R&amp;amp;B]] as well as sports and fashion. The magazine is published by [[Harris Publications]] and was a spinoff from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nytimes-20040831&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news |first=Lola |last=Ogunnaike |title=New Magazines for Black Men Proudly Redefine the Pinup |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E5DD1731F932A0575BC0A9629C8B63 |work=The New York Times |publisher= |date=August 31, 2004 |accessdate=22 December 2008 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It ceased publication on March 31, 2009, citing failing ad sales as a result of the poor economy and plans to release monthly installments soon.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sohh.com/2009/03/breaking_king_magazine_fo.html News: BREAKING: King Magazine Folds, Falling Ad Market To Blame]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It resumed publication, this time as a quarterly magazine, in late 2009.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=67038 |title=King Magazine&amp;apos;s EIC Revealed |publisher=[[XXL (magazine)|XXLmag.com]] |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=January 8, 2010 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;King&amp;apos;&amp;apos; magazine is mainly characterized by its lavish [[photoshoots]], which usually feature scantily-clad women, often complete with an interview from the featured model. The subjects of these shoots range from professional models such as  [[Melyssa Ford]] and [[Toccara]] to well-known musicians and actresses, including [[Trina]], [[Keyshia Cole]] and [[Elise Neal]]. It also features interviews with rappers. The magazine almost exclusively uses pictures from its photoshoots as the cover of the magazine.

The magazine is sometimes called &amp;quot;The black &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;. The Lycos 50 Daily Report noted the magazine received more online searches than &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Newsweek&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reader&amp;apos;s Digest&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web |url=http://50.lycos.com/090803.asp |title=Hot Read: King Magazine |accessdate=22 December 2008|work=Lycos 50 |publisher=Lycos |date=8 September 2003}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
