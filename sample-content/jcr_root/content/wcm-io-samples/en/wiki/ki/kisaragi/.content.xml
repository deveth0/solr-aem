{{About|the name|the Japanese ship sunk in the Battle of Wake Island|Japanese destroyer Kisaragi|the 2007 film|Kisaragi (film)}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kisaragi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (如月 or 衣更着) is a traditional name for February in the [[Japanese calendar]].

The meaning of &amp;quot;kisaragi&amp;quot; is not so deep as those of the other names of the months. It is written as &amp;quot;wear more clothes&amp;quot; in [[kanji]]; it also means &amp;quot;the rehabilitation of plants.&amp;quot; In the [[lunar calendar]], which was used until the [[Heian Period]], February was the second month of winter; January, February, March made up winter, and the three months starting from April were considered spring.
