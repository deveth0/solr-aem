&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kilan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-fa|كيلان}}, or more properly, Kailan, also [[Romanize]]d as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kīlān&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kilun&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{GEOnet3|-3071654}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; is a city in the [[Central District (Damavand County)|Central District]] of [[Damavand County]], [[Tehran Province]], [[Iran]].  At the 2006 census, its population was 3,038, in 913 families.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{IranCensus2006|23}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The name is derived from the Kurdish tribe of Kailan/Khailan/Gailan who were settled in this region in the [[Safavid]] period. Only a few still speak Kurdish and mostly further up north toward [[Kelardasht]]. The local folklore, however, produces a [[folk etymology]] for the now mysterious name as &amp;quot;meaning  &amp;apos; Kingsplace.

In the mountain area of Kilan, leftovers were found from people living there about [[stoneage|eighteen thousand years ago]]. The mountains around the town, like [[Dar Ali]], are scattered with remainders from the [[Tertiary]].

As of 2006, there are around 3,000 inhabitants, with a remarkably high (75%) of the inhabitants of the [[town]] having [[university|academic degrees]].

The name is a popular last name across the [[Islamic World]]. This is largely due to the impact of the famous [[medieval]] [[mystic]], [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]], the [[Sufi]] master of the [[Qadiriyya]] [[Sufi order]].  The Prime Minster of Pakistan [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]], for example, carries this as his last name. But this is because of their adherence to the Qadiriyya Sufims than belonging to the tribe or family by that last name.
