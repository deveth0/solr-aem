&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kilnsey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small [[village]] in [[Wharfedale]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[England]]. It lies on the [[B6160 road]], between the villages of [[Grassington]] and  [[Kettlewell]], near [[Arncliffe, North Yorkshire|Arncliffe]] and just across the [[River Wharfe]] from [[Conistone]].

The most notable feature of Kilnsey is a large [[limestone]] cliff called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kilnsey Crag&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, overlooking the road and the River Wharfe from the west.  The Crag is around 170 feet high, with an overhang of 40 feet.  West from Kilnsey towards [[Malham Tarn]] runs the historic Mastiles Lane, a Roman marching road, later an important drovers&amp;apos; way for [[Fountains Abbey]] flocks to summer pasture on higher ground, approximately five miles distant.  This is now a Dales walking track.  The Old Hall in Kilnsey was medieval administrative site for wool trade.  Most of the present building, well restored, dates from 1658.

Kilnsey has one pub, the Tennant Arms, a trout farm, and a small collection of houses.

The village hosts a large, annual agricultural show.
