&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kilcreggan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a village in [[Argyll and Bute]], [[Scotland]].

It developed on the north shore of the [[Firth of Clyde]] at a time when [[Clyde steamer]]s brought it within easy reach of [[Glasgow]] at about 25&amp;amp;nbsp;miles (40&amp;amp;nbsp;km) west of the centre of Glasgow by boat. Many Glasgow shipowners and merchants made their summer retreats or even permanent residences there, and this is reflected in some very grand houses along the shore. Not all have remained occupied, some were demolished and others have been converted into flats.

Its location at the end of the [[Rosneath Peninsula]], between the [[Gare Loch]] and [[Loch Long]], makes the journey 38&amp;amp;nbsp;miles (60&amp;amp;nbsp;km) by road. The B833 minor road runs along the shore for the length of the village then cuts north inland just to the east of Kilcreggan pier rather than going east along the shore past Portkil bay to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rosneath Point&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. About 2&amp;amp;nbsp;miles (3&amp;amp;nbsp;km) north of Kilcreggan the road reaches the village of [[Rosneath]] then continues north along the shores of the Gare Loch.

The majority of the houses look south across the Clyde towards the towns of [[Gourock]] and [[Greenock]], and further down the firth towards the [[Isle of Arran]].

Large attractive houses continue westwards from the pier towards &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron&amp;apos;s Point&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which marks the southern entrance to Loch Long, almost to the adjoining village of [[Cove, Argyll and Bute|Cove]] which looks across &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cove Bay&amp;apos;&amp;apos; towards [[Blairmore, Argyll|Blairmore]] only about 2&amp;amp;nbsp;miles (3&amp;amp;nbsp;km) distant, but separated by the deep waters of Loch Long. To the east of the pier, houses at Portkil extend down to Portkil bay, and the 413â€“foot (126&amp;amp;nbsp;m) hill at Rosneath home farm is topped by a television mast.

A ferry subsidised by [[Strathclyde Partnership for Transport]] provides a regular service from Kilcreggan pier across the Clyde to Gourock. Until 2012, the ferry service also included crossings of the Gare Loch to [[Helensburgh]], and was operated by [[Clyde Marine Services]] which ran the elderly {{MV|Kenilworth}} until 2007 when they introduced the new {{MV|Seabus}} for the route. After re-tendering, the contract for the Gourock to Kilcreggan route was awarded by SPT to Clydelink which bought the smaller MV &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Island Princess&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for the run and commenced services on 1 April 2012. The changeover ended manning of Kilcreggan pier, and on 24 March 2012 more than 400 people protested at the pier over fears for the future of the service.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Argyll News: Inaugural Clydelink Kilcreggan to Gourock ferry service | For Argyll | url = http://forargyll.com/2012/04/inaugural-clydelink-kilcreggan-to-gourock-ferry-service/ | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 27 April 2012 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;www.bbc.co.uk&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite news  | last =  | first =  | title = BBC News - Ferry fears spark protest at historic Kilcreggan Pier | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-17500570 | publisher =  | date =  24 March 2012| accessdate = 27 April 2012 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Kilcreggan is in the historic county of [[Dunbartonshire]]. Before the local government reorganisation in 1975 it formed part of the joint [[police burgh]] of [[Cove (Scotland)|Cove]] and Kilcreggan. It then formed part of [[Dumbarton]] District and [[Strathclyde Region]] until the reorganisation of the 1990s. It has been part of Argyll and Bute unitary authority since then.
