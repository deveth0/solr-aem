        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kittanning Gap&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a gap at the summit of [[Allegheny Ridge]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} in central [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States]]. It is located in [[Logan Township, Blair County, Pennsylvania|Logan Township]], approximately 5&amp;amp;nbsp;mi (8&amp;amp;nbsp;km) west of [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]].

==History==
In the 18th century the [[Kittanning Path]] passed through the gap, providing a route between central and western Pennsylvania for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and early white settlers. It was later selected as the site for a [[railroad]] line across the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. The challenge of constructing a railroad through the ridge led to the construction of the unique [[Horseshoe Curve (Pennsylvania)|Horseshoe Curve]] in 1854, now designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]].
