The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kingsway Tunnel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a road [[tunnel]] under the [[River Mersey]] in [[Merseyside]], northwest England, and runs between [[Liverpool]] and [[Wallasey]]. It is one and half miles (2.4&amp;amp;nbsp;km) long and is often called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wallasey Tunnel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to distinguish it from the older [[Queensway Tunnel]] which runs between [[Liverpool]] and [[Birkenhead]].

The tunnel was constructed over a five-year period by [[Edmund Nuttall]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://jisc.iceknowledge.com/ArticleView.aspx?doi=10.1680/iicep.1972.5829 ICE Virtual Tour]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; after the Queensway Tunnel became unable to cope with modern volumes of traffic. It was opened in June 1971 by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and consists of twin tubes, each having two {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide lanes.

The entrance to the Kingsway Tunnel is used as the basis of a tunnel entrance in the video game [[Grand Theft Auto III]] — during the 1990s, several members of the game&amp;apos;s development team had worked for the Merseyside-based development company [[Psygnosis]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The present fee for a single car journey through the tunnel is £1.60,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merseytunnels.co.uk/nossl/html/fees.php| title=Mersey Tunnels: Tolls, Fees and Charges}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; payable at the Wallasey end of the tunnel for vehicles travelling in either direction.

In a study following the fire in the [[Mont Blanc Tunnel]] in 1999, inspectors from the [[European Union]] rated the Kingsway Tunnel as &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;, one of only eight to receive that rating in Europe.
