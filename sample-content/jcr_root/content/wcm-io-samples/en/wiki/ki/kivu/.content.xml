&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kivu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the name for a large &amp;quot;Region&amp;quot; in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] under the rule of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] that bordered [[Lake Kivu]].  It included three &amp;quot;Sub-Regions&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Sous-Regions&amp;quot; in French): [[Nord-Kivu]], [[Sud-Kivu]] and [[Maniema]], corresponding to the three [[Subdivisions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|current provinces]] created in 1986.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[International Crisis Group]], Congo: A Comprehensive Strategy to Disarm the FDLR, Africa Report No. 151, 9 July 2009, p.1&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The capital of the Kivu Region was in [[Bukavu]], and the capitals of the three Sub-Regions were in [[Goma]], [[Uvira]] and [[Kindu]].

==Geography==
Kivu is also the name for the entire region surrounding [[Lake Kivu]], including the portions in [[Rwanda]] which contain the vast majority of the lake area&amp;apos;s population (the contiguous towns of [[Goma]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Gisenyi]], [[Rwanda]], with a combined population approaching 1,000,000, form the largest urbanised area in the [[Lake Kivu]] area).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.geo.arizona.edu/geo5xx/geos577/projects/kayzar/index.html  Lake Kivu Home Page]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The area is characterized by lush vegetation and an extended growing season due in part to its high altitude (1500&amp;amp;nbsp;m or 4900&amp;amp;nbsp;ft at the lakeshore) and the volcanic nature of its soil. The Kivu region represents the high point of the [[East African Rift]] Valley.

The lake itself contains a massive amount of [[carbon dioxide]] in its depths, and there is some concern that tectonic activity ([[rift]]ing) and/or [[volcano|volcanic]] activity might cause a sudden release of this captured carbon dioxide. If this were to happen it would devastate the population around the lake; however, the likelihood of this occurring is in dispute with arguments on both sides.
