&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kirchberg&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;the Kirchberg&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Quarters of Luxembourg City|quarter]] in north-eastern [[Luxembourg City]], in southern [[Luxembourg]].  It consists of a [[plateau]] situated to the north-east of the city centre, [[Ville Haute]].

In 2001, the quarter had a population of 3,534 people distributed over its residential areas.  Its most notable features are various [[European Union]] institutions, including the [[European Court of Justice]], [[European Court of Auditors]], parts of the [[European Commission]], the Secretariat of the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Investment Bank]], and the [[European School of Luxembourg]], which are all located in the western part. This area also comprises a number of buildings belonging to the [[University of Luxembourg]].The eastern part hosts offices and many international banks as well as an [[Auchan]]-owned shopping centre, the [[Luxexpo]] exhibition centre, the [[Utopolis Kirchberg]] cinema, and Kirchberg Hospital.

Kirchberg is also home to many other institutions of national importance.  [[D&amp;apos;Coque]] arena is the country&amp;apos;s largest sports venue, with seating for 8,300 spectators, and takes up a large part of the &amp;apos;quartier du parc&amp;apos; in central Kirchberg.  The [[Philharmonie Luxembourg]] is Luxembourg&amp;apos;s national [[concert hall]], the grand auditorium of which can seat over 1,500 people. [[Mudam]], a [[museum]] of [[modern art]] opened in 2006, was designed by [[I.M. Pei]] and displays works by some of the world&amp;apos;s most notable modern artists.  On the same site as the Mudam is the reconstructed [[Fort Thüngen]], formerly a part of Luxembourg&amp;apos;s formidable fortifications.

== Microclimate ==

Like Luxembourg-City, Kirchberg has a general [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Cfb), marked by high [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], particularly in late summer. However, the slope and height of the area accounts for occasional deeper temperatures (up to 1° below Luxembourg-City), more frequent fog and enhanced precipitations in both rain and snow.
