==Onsen resort==
Kinosaki is famous as a resort area, with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[onsen]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Japanese hot springs). In 1913, the writer [[Shiga Naoya]] came to Kinosaki and stayed there for three weeks. Kinosaki provided inspiration for his short story, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kinosaki ni te&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;quot;In Kinosaki&amp;quot;.

A feature is the fountains in the square where mesh bags of eggs can be immersed and boiled while you wait. There are several small ponds of running hot water where one can sit by the edge of the road and relax while soaking one&amp;apos;s feet. A ropeway at the far end of the street take visitors to the lookout or one can walk there.
