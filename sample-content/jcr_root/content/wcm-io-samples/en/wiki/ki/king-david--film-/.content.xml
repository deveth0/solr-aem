==Reception==
The film was not well received by the critics, with the [[New York Times]] calling it [http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9407E7D91438F93AA15750C0A963948260 &amp;quot;...not a good film...&amp;quot;]. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives &amp;apos;&amp;apos;King David&amp;apos;&amp;apos; a 14% rating. Gere&amp;apos;s performance in the film earned him a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] nomination for Worst Actor.

Bruce Beresford later said of the film:
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;I think there are a few things in it that are interesting. But, I think there are so many things that are wrong. We never liked the script... we never really caught the friendship between David and Jonathan. There weren&amp;apos;t enough scenes between them. And David, himself - I think Richard Gere was miscast. He is a wonderful actor but he is much better in contemporary pieces.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page=Bruce+Beresford&amp;amp;bl &amp;quot;Interview with Bruce Beresford&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Signet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 15 May 1999] accessed 17 November 2012&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
