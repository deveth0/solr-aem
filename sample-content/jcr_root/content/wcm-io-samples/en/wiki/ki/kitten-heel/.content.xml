A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;kitten heel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a short, slender [[heel (shoe)|heel]], usually from 3.5 centimeters (1.5&amp;amp;nbsp;inches) to 4.75 centimeters (1.75&amp;amp;nbsp;inches) high with a slight curve setting the heel in from the edge of the shoe. The style was popularized by [[Audrey Hepburn]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;AudreyBook&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book | last = Moseley | first = Rachel | title = Growing Up With Audrey Hepburn: Text, Audience, Resonance |year= 2003 |publisher= Manchester University Press| isbn = 0-7190-6311-6}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
==Definition==
Kitten heels, sometimes called short [[stiletto heel|stilettos]], are shoes with a tapered heel of approximately 1-3 inches height. They are on the shorter end of stiletto shoes, which can have heels as tall as 5 inches.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;FeetAndFootwear&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book | last = DeMello | first = Margo | title = Feet and Footwear: A Cultural Encyclopedia |year= 2009 |publisher= Macmillan| isbn = 0-3133-5714-5}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
They were introduced in the late 1950s as formal fashion attire for young adolescent teenage girls as higher heels would have been considered unseemly for girls as young as 13 because of the sexual connotations and unease of walk. They were sometimes referred to as &amp;quot;trainer heels&amp;quot; in the US, indicating their use in getting young girls used to wearing high heels. However, by the early 1960s, they became fashionable for older teenagers and eventually for women of all ages until the demise of the [[stiletto heel]] in the late 1960s. They emerged again in the 1980s along with wedge heels and have become once again fashionable since 2003, but are not made in abundance due to the preference for stiletto heels by women during this time period. [[Manolo Blahnik]] has added kitten heeled shoes to his collection, saying that his famous high stilettos have been so often copied that he was inspired to create a heel at a new, shorter height.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ClevelandEditor&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news|last = Luther | first=Marylou |title =Sexy kitten heel started mewing in the &amp;apos;60s |newspaper = The Plain Dealer |date =October 10, 2007 | url= http://www.cleveland.com/style/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/living-0/1192006082234330.xml&amp;amp;coll=2}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
