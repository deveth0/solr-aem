&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kingdom&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was a [[professional wrestling]] company in [[Japan]] from 1997 to 1998. It was essentially a continuation of [[UWF International]], having most of its former roster: [[Nobuhiko Takada]], [[Yoji Anjo]], [[Kazushi Sakuraba]], [[Daijiro Matsui]], [[Naoki Sano]], [[Masahito Kakihara]], [[Yoshihiro Takayama]], [[Kenichi Yamamoto]] and [[Hiromitsu Kanehara]].

==History==
Kingdom did not draw the huge crowds UWF International did in its heyday, and most of its major [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Card|cards]] were at [[Korakuen Hall]] in [[Tokyo]], which could seat 2,000 fans on average. Kingdom attempted to rectify this by inviting talent from other promotions, including [[Battlarts]], but it did not have much effect. In the eyes of the Japanese fans the era of [[Shoot wrestling#Shoot-style|shoot-style wrestling]] was invalid.

Kingdom went out of business in March 1998. Takada, who had given up on the concept in mid-1997 and began competing for the [[Pride Fighting Championships|PRIDE]] [[martial arts]] circuit, Sano, Matsui, and Sakuraba formed [[Takada Dojo]], a stable associated with PRIDE; Yamamoto and Kanehara jumped to [[RINGS]]; Kakihara and Takayama joined [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] as free agents; and Anjo dabbled in the [[K-1]] [[kickboxing]] circuit, slipping into obscurity due to his bad record (he later reappeared with Dream Stage Entertainment&amp;apos;s HUSTLE pro wrestling organization as &amp;quot;Commander ANJOE&amp;quot;.)

A former trainee of the Kingdom dojo, [[Hidetada Irie]], who debuted in 1999, formed a promotion called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kingdom Ehrgeiz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, with himself as the top star. The promotion, however, is very obscure and rarely draws above 100 fans in the few cards it periodically holds.
