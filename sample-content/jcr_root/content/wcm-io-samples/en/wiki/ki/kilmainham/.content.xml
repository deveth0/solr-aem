        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kilmainham&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Irish place name|Cill Mhaighneann}}, meaning &amp;quot;St Maighnenn&amp;apos;s church&amp;quot;) is a suburb of [[Dublin]] south of the [[River Liffey]] and west of the [[Central business district|city centre]], in the Dublin 8 [[Dublin postal districts|postal district]].

==History==
In the [[Viking Age|Viking era]], the monastery was home to the first Norse base (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;longphort&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) in Ireland.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Halsall, Guy. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Warfare and Society in the Barbarian West, 450-900&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (London:  Routledge, 2003), p.156.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the 12th century the lands on the banks of the Liffey first belonged to the [[Knights Templar]]. [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]] erected for them a castle
about a mile distant from the Danish wall of old Dublin; and [[Hugh Tyrrel]], first [[Barony of Castleknock|Baron Castleknock]], granted them part of the lands which now  form [[Phoenix Park]]. Here the Templars flourished, for nearly a century and a half, until the process for their suppression was instituted under [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], in 1308. Thirty members of the order were imprisoned and examined in Dublin and  the order was condemned and suppressed. Their lands and privileges were given to the priory of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John of Jerusalem]], who remained in possession until the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century.&amp;lt;ref name=harris&amp;gt;[[Walter Harris (historian)|Walter Harris]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The History and Antiquities of the City of Dublin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Until the time of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], when [[Dublin Castle]] became the centre of English power, the [[Lord Lieutenant]]s often held court at the manor of Kilmainham. In 1559, the earl of Sussex, on being again appointed Lord Lieutenant, found that the building at Kilmainham had been damaged by a storm, and had to hold court at the [[Manor of St. Sepulchre|palace of St. Sepulchre]].  The following year Elizabeth ordered that Dublin Castle be upgraded to enable the Lord Lieutenant to reside there, and Kilmainham fell out of favour.&amp;lt;ref name=harris/&amp;gt;

The [[Manor of Kilmainham]] formed a [[The Liberties, Dublin|liberty]] outside the jurisdiction of the city of Dublin, with its own rights and privileges. The manor took in parts of James&amp;apos;s Street and side-streets and stretched as far as [[Lucan, Dublin|Lucan]] and [[Chapelizod]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;D&amp;apos;Alton: History of the County Dublin. 1838. p. 301&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; After the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], former lords (or chairmen, as they were later called) of this manor included [[Valentine Lawless, 2nd Baron Cloncurry|Lord Cloncurry]] and Sir Edward Newenham. John &amp;quot;Bully&amp;quot; Egan, from Charleville, County Cork, was chairman from 1790 to 1800.

These manorial rights were abolished around 1840.

== Local attractions ==
The area is best known for [[Royal Hospital Kilmainham]], constructed on the site where the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John of Jerusalem]] had their priory in Dublin. It now houses the [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]]. Nearby is [[Kilmainham Gaol]], where the [[Capital punishment|executions]] of the leaders of the [[Easter Rising]] took place.

Kilmainham holds one of a small number of [[Viking era]] burial sites ([[Old Norse]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;haugr&amp;apos;&amp;apos; meaning barrow or mound), within Dublin, others including [[Bully&amp;apos;s Acre, Dublin|Bully&amp;apos;s Acre]] and where [[College Green]] is now located.

== Railway station ==
The [[Dublin Heuston railway station]], one of Dublin&amp;apos;s two main [[Train station|railway stations]], is nearby.
