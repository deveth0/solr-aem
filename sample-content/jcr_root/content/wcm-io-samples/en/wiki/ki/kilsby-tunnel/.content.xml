The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kilsby Tunnel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[railway]] [[tunnel]] on the [[West Coast Main Line]] railway in England. It was designed and engineered by [[Robert Stephenson]].

The tunnel is located near the village of [[Kilsby]] in [[Northamptonshire]] roughly 5 miles (8 km) south-east of [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] and is {{convert|2432|yd|m}} long.

The tunnel was opened in 1838 as a part of the [[London and Birmingham Railway]]. It is today the 18th longest tunnel on the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|British railway system]].

The tunnel took far longer, and cost far more money to build than had been anticipated. This was because the tunnel builders encountered unexpected [[quicksand]] which trial borings into the hill had not revealed. The excess water from the quicksand had to be pumped out, a process which took several years. Similar problems were encountered with nearby [[Blisworth tunnel]] on the [[Grand Union Canal]] a few decades earlier.

The length of time it took to build the tunnel delayed the opening of the London and Birmingham Railway.

It took three years, and cost £320,000 to build &amp;amp;mdash; three times the original estimate (£23,758,000 in 2005 pounds).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;According to Table 1 of http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2006/rp06-009.pdf, the RPI index in 1838 was 10.2 and had risen to 757.3 in 2005, giving a conversion factor of 74.245. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
(An estimate of today&amp;apos;s cost, using machines but no fatalities, would be interesting.)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
