&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kilburn Park tube station&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a Grade II listed [[London Underground]] station at [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] in the [[London Borough of Brent]]. The station is on the [[Bakerloo line|Bakerloo Line]], between [[Queen&amp;apos;s Park station|Queen&amp;apos;s Park]] and [[Maida Vale tube station|Maida Vale]] stations, and is in [[Travelcard]] [[Travelcard Zone 2|Zone 2]].

The station is situated on Cambridge Avenue approximately 100 m west of [[Kilburn High Road]], shortly before it becomes [[Maida Vale]], ([[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]).

==History==
Kilburn Park was opened on 31 January 1915 as the temporary terminus of the Bakerloo line&amp;apos;s extension from [[London Paddington station|Paddington station]] towards Queen&amp;apos;s Park.&amp;lt;ref name=rose&amp;gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Douglas |title=The London Underground, A Diagrammatic History |year=1999 |publisher=Douglas Rose/Capital Transport |isbn=1-85414-219-4 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Services were extended to Queen&amp;apos;s Park on 11 February 1915.&amp;lt;ref name=rose/&amp;gt; At the extension&amp;apos;s opening, Maida Vale station was not complete and the previous station was [[Warwick Avenue tube station|Warwick Avenue]] until 6 June 1915.&amp;lt;ref name=rose/&amp;gt; The station building was designed by [[Stanley Heaps]] in a modified version of the earlier [[Leslie Green]] designed Bakerloo line stations with [[Glazed architectural terra-cotta|glazed terra cotta]] façades but without the large semi-circular windows at first floor level. It was one of the first London Underground stations built specifically to use [[escalator]]s rather than [[elevator|lifts]].&amp;lt;ref name=escalators&amp;gt;The first escalator on the Underground was installed at [[Earl&amp;apos;s Court tube station|Earl&amp;apos;s Court]] in 1911. The first station built specifically for escalators was the new Central line station at [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street]] in 1912. All deep-tube stations built after 1913 were built with escalators - {{cite book |last=Wolmar |first=Christian |authorlink = Christian Wolmar |title = The Subterranean Railway: How the London Underground Was Built and How It Changed the City Forever |publisher = Atlantic Books |year=2004 |chapter=Beginning to Make Sense |pages=205–206 |isbn=1-84354-023-1}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
