&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;King Wu of Zhou&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|c={{linktext|周|武|王}}}}), formerly romanized &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;King Wu of Chou&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was the first [[wang (title)|king]] of the [[Zhou dynasty]] of ancient China. The chronology of his reign is disputed but is generally thought to have begun around 1046 BC and ended three years later in 1043 BC.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;These dates are those of the [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China]]&amp;apos;s official [[Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project]], although they remain controversial.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

King Wu&amp;apos;s [[Chinese ancestral name|ancestral name]] was [[Ji (surname)|Ji]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|姬}}}}) and given name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|發}}}}).  He was the second son of [[King Wen of Zhou|Chang]], Lord of the West. In most accounts, his older brother [[Bo Yikao]] was said to have predeceased his father, typically at the hands of [[King Zhou of Shang|King Zhou]], the last king of the [[Shang dynasty]]; in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Book of Rites]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, however, it is assumed that his inheritance represented an older tradition among the Zhou of passing over the eldest son.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Book of Rites]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [http://ctext.org/liji/tan-gong-i Tan Gong I, 1]. Accessed 4 Nov 2012.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; (Fa&amp;apos;s grandfather [[Ji Jili|Jili]] had likewise inherited Zhou despite two older brothers.)

Upon his succession, Fa worked with his father-in-law [[Jiang Ziya]] to accomplish his father&amp;apos;s unfinished task: overthrowing the [[Shang dynasty]]. In 1048 BC, Fa marched down the [[Yellow River]] to the [[Mengjin County|Mengjin ford]] and met with more than 800 dukes.{{fact|date=April 2012}} He constructed an [[ancestral tablet]] naming his father Chang [[King Wen of Zhou|King Wen]] and placed it on a chariot in the middle of the host; considering the timing unpropitious, though, he did not yet attack Shang. In 1046 BC, King Wu took advantage of Shang disunity to launch an attack along with many neighboring dukes. The [[Battle of Muye]] destroyed Shang&amp;apos;s forces and King Zhou of Shang set his palace on fire, dying within.

King Wu {{ndash}} the name means &amp;quot;Martial&amp;quot; {{ndash}} followed his victory by establishing many [[fengjian|feudal states]] under his 16 younger brothers and clans allied by marriage, but his death three years later provoked several rebellions against his young heir [[King Cheng of Zhou|King Cheng]] and the regent [[Duke of Zhou]], even from [[Three Guards|three of his brothers]].
