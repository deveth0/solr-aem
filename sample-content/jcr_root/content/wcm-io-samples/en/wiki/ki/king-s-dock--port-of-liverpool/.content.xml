        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;King&amp;apos;s Dock&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Dock (maritime)|dock]] on the [[River Mersey]], [[England]] and part of the [[Port of Liverpool]]. It was situated in the southern dock system, connected to [[Wapping Dock]] to the north and [[Queen&amp;apos;s Dock, Port of Liverpool|Queens Dock]] to the south. It consisted of two [[branch dock]]s. The dock was designed by [[Henry Berry]] and opened in 1785. Further warehouse buildings were added by [[John Foster, Sr. (architect)|John Foster, Sr.]].

The branch docks have been filled in, and the open space was often used as a concert venue, when a large tent and stage was erected. The [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]] played their [[Liverpool Summer Pops|Summer Pops]] concert series here. [[Everton FC]] had proposed to build a new stadium here, but those plans fell through in 2003.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/everton/2940481.stm|title=Everton fail in King&amp;apos;s Dock bid|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 April 2003|accessdate=22 March 2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The 11,000 capacity [[Echo Arena Liverpool]] and convention centre officially opened in January 2008&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citation|url=http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Business/Economic_development/Area_or_site_specific_regeneration/Kings_Dock/index.asp|title=Liverpool Arena and Convention Centre (King&amp;apos;s Dock)|publisher=Liverpool City Council|accessdate=22 March 2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
when Liverpool&amp;apos;s year of [[European Capital of Culture]] began. The site also encompasses office space, hotels and apartments.
