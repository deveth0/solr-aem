&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nicias&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[Indo-Greek]] king who ruled in the [[Paropamisade]]. Most of his relatively few coins have been found in northern [[Pakistan]], indicating that he ruled a smaller principate around the lower [[Kabul]] valley.
He was possibly a relative of [[Menander I]].

==Time of reign==
Bopearachchi suggests that Nikias ruled ca. 90–85 BCE. This late date is supported by the absence of Attic coins (see below).

R. C. Senior on the other hand places him as a successor of Menander, ca. 135–125 BCE, according to his interpretation of hoard findings.

Regardless of which period is correct, the fact that Nicias ages visibly on his coins seems to indicate some longevity to his rule.

==The coinage of Nicias==
Nicias struck Indian silver drachms of diademed or helmeted king with three reverses:
*A walking king, as seen above right, found on several drachms.
*An en face version of Menander&amp;apos;s Athena with thunderbolt is found on a unique tetradrachm.
*The third reverse is the type king on a prancing horse, as used by [[Antimachus II]] found on a single drachm.

His bronzes feature Zeus/dolphin or portrait / king on prancing horse. Some varieties are crude with lunate sigmas and square omicrons. Even though Nikias ruled in the western parts of the Indo-Greek realm, no Attic coins have been found.

His monograms generally match those of the kings [[Theophilos (king)|Theophilus]] and [[Philoxenios|Philoxenus]], though one is shared with [[Thrason]], the short-lived son of Menander I.
