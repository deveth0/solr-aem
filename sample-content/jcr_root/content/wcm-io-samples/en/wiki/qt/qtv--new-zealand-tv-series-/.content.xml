&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;QTV&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[New Zealand]] children&amp;apos;s science-based multimedia series designed to engage young people in the world around them.

The series is fronted by the &amp;quot;Q Team&amp;quot;, four young people with a passion for discovery and science.  The Wellington-based team is Barnaby Fredric, Chelsie Crayford, Tess Devereux, and Paora Durie.

Each week one of the team throws down a new scientific challenge and kids are encouraged to post their findings online, where further opportunities for exploration and participation abound.
