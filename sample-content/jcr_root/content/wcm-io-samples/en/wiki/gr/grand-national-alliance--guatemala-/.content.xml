==Formation and 2003 election==
GANA was created as an electoral alliance to fight the [[Guatemalan general election, 2003|2003 general election]]. In that election, held on 9 November 2003, the Grand National Alliance, won 24.3% of the vote, and 47 out of 158 seats in [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress]]. The [[President of Guatemala|presidential]] candidate of the alliance, [[Óscar Berger Perdomo]], won 34.3% at the presidential elections of the same day. He won 54.1% at the second round and was elected president.

The alliance was made up of the following parties:
*[[Patriotic Party (Guatemala)|Patriotic Party]] (Partido Patriota) (PP)
*[[Reform Movement (Guatemala)|Reform Movement]] (Movimiento Reformador) (MR)
*[[National Solidarity Party (Guatemala)|National Solidarity Party]] (Partido Solidaridad Nacional) (PSN)

==Evolution and 2007 election==
The Patriotic Party broke with the alliance in the early months of Óscar Berger&amp;apos;s administration. [http://www.lahora.com.gt/04/05/20/paginas/opinion.htm#n8] In November 2005, the National Solidarity Party ceded its electoral registration to GANA, with which the Grand National Alliance ceased to be an alliance and became a party. In August 2006, the Reform Movement withdrew its support from GANA. [http://www.fundadesc.org/archivo/sesentaycuatro/analisis.htm]

GANA&amp;apos;s candidate in the [[Guatemalan general election, 2007|2007 presidential election]] was former director of the national prison service [[Alejandro Giammattei]]. He came in third place in the election, with 17% of the vote. Despite the splits in the party, it did relatively well in the congressional elections, receiving 37 seats and becoming the second largest party in Congress.
