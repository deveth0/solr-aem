&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Great Horwood&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small [[village]] and is also a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] within [[Aylesbury Vale]] district in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]] with a population of about 1025 people (2001 Census). It is about five miles ESE of [[Buckingham]], six miles WSW of [[Milton Keynes]].

The village name &amp;apos;Horwood&amp;apos; is [[Old English language|Anglo Saxon]] in origin, and means &amp;apos;muddy wood&amp;apos;.  The affix &amp;apos;Great&amp;apos; was added later to differentiate it from the adjacent village [[Little Horwood]].  In the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] in 792 the village was recorded as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Horwudu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The village was from ancient times on the periphery of the [[Whaddon Chase]]: [[monarchy|royal]] hunting land that stretched across the north part of the [[Aylesbury Vale]].  In 1447 the village was granted [[Royal charter]] to hold a weekly [[market]], thus becoming a [[market town]].  The rents from the market were collected by [[New College, Oxford]].

Great Horwood is no longer a market town.

A [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] within the [[parish]] border of Great Horwood is [[Singleborough]].

Both Great Horwood village itself and Singleborough have [[Conservation Areas]] and there are 46 Grade II [[listed building]]s in the Parish.

The parish church is dedicated to [[Saint James the Great|St James]].

The village is also home to Great Horwood Church of England Combined School, which is a mixed [[Church of England]] [[primary school]]. It is a [[voluntary controlled]] school, which takes children from the age of four through to the age of eleven. The school has approximately 160 pupils. Its catchment area also includes the villages of [[Thornborough, Buckinghamshire|Thornborough]], [[Nash, Buckinghamshire|Nash]], [[Beachampton]] and [[Whaddon, Buckinghamshire|Whaddon]].
