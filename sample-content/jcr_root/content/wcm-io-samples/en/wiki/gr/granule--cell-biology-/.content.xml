In [[Cell (biology)|cell biology]], a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;granule&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small particle.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000045972|granule}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It can be any structure barely visible by light microscopy. The term is most often used to describe a [[Secretory_pathway|secretory]] [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]].

==Leukocytes==
A group of [[leukocytes]] called [[granulocytes]] contain granules and play an important role in the immune system. The granules of certain cells, such as [[natural killer cell]]s, contain components which can lead to the [[lysis]] of neighboring cells. The granules of [[leukocytes]] are classified as [[azurophilic granules]] or [[specific granules]].
Leukocyte granules are released in response to immunological stimuli during a process known as [[degranulation]].

==Platelets==
The granules of [[platelets]] are classified as [[dense granule]]s and [[Platelet alpha-granule|alpha granule]]s.

==Germline granules==
In 1957, André and Rouiller first coined the term &amp;quot;[[nuage]]&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;André J, Rouiller CH (1957) L&amp;apos;ultrastructure de la membrane nucléaire des ovocytes del l&amp;apos;araignée (Tegenaria domestica Clark). Proc European Conf Electron Microscopy, Stockholm 1956. Academic
Press, New York, pp 162 164&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; (French for &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot;). Its [[amorphous]] and fibrous structure occurred in drawings as early as in 1933 (Risley). Today, the nuage is accepted to represent a characteristic, [[electron density|electrondense ]] [[germ plasm]] [[organelle]] encapsulating the [[cytoplasmic]] face of the [[nuclear envelope]] of the cells destined to the [[germline]] fate. The same granular material is also known under various synonyms: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;dense bodies, [[mitochondrial]] clouds, yolk nuclei, Balbiani bodies, perinuclear P granules in [[Caenorhabditis elegans]], germinal granules in [[Xenopus laevis]] and [[chromatoidal bodies]] in mouse and polar granules in [[Drosophila]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Molecularly, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;nuage&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a tightly interwoven network of differentially localized [[RNA-binding protein]]s, which in turn localize specific [[mRNA]] species for differential storage, asymmetric segregation (as needed for [[asymmetric cell division]]), differential splicing and/or translational control. The [[germline]] granules appear to be ancestral and universally conserved in the germlines of all [[metazoa]]n [[Phylum|phyla]].
