&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grande Comore&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, officially called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ngazidja&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} is an island in the [[Indian Ocean]] off the coast of [[Africa]]. It is the largest island in the [[Comoros]] nation. Most of its population is of the Comorian ethnic group. Its population as of 2006 is about 316,600. The island&amp;apos;s capital is [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]], which is also the national capital. The island is made up of two [[shield volcano]]es, with [[Mount Karthala]] being the country&amp;apos;s highest point at {{Convert|2361|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. According to the 2009 revision of the constitution of 2002, it is governed by an elected Governor, as are the other islands, with the federal government being much reduced in power.

== History ==
[[File:Franz Sikora 038.jpg|thumb|left|Sultan Said Ali bin Said Omar of Grande Comore (1897).]]

For several centuries, Grande Comore was divided into a number of [[sultan]]ates, including Bambao, Itsandra, Mitsamihuli, [[Mbajini]], Hambuu, Washili, Hamahame, Mbwankuu, Mbude and Domba. The sultans were also known as mfaume. In 1886, the ruler of [[Sultanate of Bambao|Bambao]], Sultan [[Said Ali bin Said Omar of Grande Comore|Said Ali bin Said Omar]], united the sultanates of Grande Comore into the state of Ngazidja, with the other sultanates maintaining autonomy. That same year, [[France]] established a protectorate over the island. In 1893, Sultan Said Ali was sent into exile on [[Réunion]]. In 1908, France annexed the island and the sultanates were abolished. In 1975, Grande Comore, [[Anjouan]] and [[Mohéli]] declared independence as the nation of Comoros.

In 1997, the Comoros nation began to fall apart as Anjouan and Moheli seceded. Grande Comore became the only island under federal control. By 2002, however, Grande Comore was reunited with the other islands under the new constitution. Abdou Soule Elbak was elected President of Grande Comore in May 2002. He received only 17% of the vote in the first round, coming in first place, and received 60% of the vote in the runoff. He remained in his post until the July 2007 elections, at which point [[Mohamed Abdoulwahab]] won the island&amp;apos;s presidency.
