==Life==
Born in [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]], Cornwall, Davey first studied art in [[Exeter, England|Exeter]] before going to [[Goldsmiths College]] in [[London]] in 1985 where he took a BA in fine art. His first solo show was at the Lisson Gallery in London in 1987.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;artist&amp;apos;s profile&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.terminartors.com/artistprofile/Davey_Grenville artist&amp;apos;s profile]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Davey is single and has one child.

==Work==
Davey&amp;apos;s work is influenced by the work of sculptors such as [[Tony Cragg]] and [[Richard Deacon (sculptor)|Richard Deacon]] and shows a similar interest in industrial materials. The simplicity of his forms shows an affinity with [[minimalism]]. Many of his works make references to everyday objects which if exhibited in themselves would be [[readymade]]s. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Button&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a metre and a half wide clothes button made in steel, is a typical early work. Later works, such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gold (Table)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (a table as tall as a human) are larger in size. Primarily a sculptor, Davey produced a series of 12 prints with five other artists including etchings and screenprints.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;artist&amp;apos;s profile&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Awards==
Davey won the Tate&amp;apos;s [[Turner Prize]] in 1992.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article3019128.ece | work=The Independent | location=London | title=What&amp;apos;s the point of the Turner Prize? | date=October 2, 2007 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;HAL&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,  the work comprised two abstract steel objects, each measuring 244 x 122&amp;amp;nbsp;cm (96 x 48 in).
