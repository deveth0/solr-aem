Great Houghton is a former mining village and its mines were served by the railway which has since gone but remains of which are still visible.

The village has a primary school called [http://www.sandhillprimary.org.uk/ Sandhill]. The old school building which once stood on the main street was demolished during 2007 and a new [[Private Finance Initiative|PFI]] primary school school replacing it.

Some parts of Great Houghton were affected by the 2007 summer flooding which caused extensive damage in neighbouring villages.
