{{periodic table (group 10)}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Group 10&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, numbered by current [[IUPAC]] style, is a [[periodic table group|group]] of [[chemical element]]s in the [[periodic table]], which consists of [[nickel]] (Ni), [[palladium]](Pd), [[platinum]](Pt), and [[darmstadtium]](Ds). All are [[d-block]] [[transition metal]]s. All known [[isotopes]] of Ds are radioactive with short half-lives, and are not known to occur in nature; only minute quantities have been synthesized in laboratories.

Like other groups, the members of this group show patterns in [[electron configuration]], especially in the outermost shells, although though for this group they are particularly weak, with palladium being an exceptional case). The relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital is the explanation to the unusual electron configuration of darmstadtium.

Darmstadtium has not been isolated in pure form, and its properties have not been conclusively observed; only nickel, palladium, and platinum have had their properties experimentally confirmed. All three elements are typical silvery-white transition metals, hard, and [[refractory]], with high melting and boiling points.

==Properties==
Group 10 metals are white to light grey in color, and possess a high [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]], a resistance to tarnish ([[oxidation]]) at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]], are highly [[ductile]], and enter into oxidation states of +2 and +4, with +1 being seen in special conditions. The existence of a +3 state is debated, as the state could be an illusory state created by +2 and +4 states.  Theory suggests that group 10 metals may produce a +6 oxidation state under precise conditions, but this remains to be proven conclusively in the laboratory.

==Applications==
The group 10 metals share several uses.  These include:
* Decorative purposes, in the form of [[jewelry]] and [[electroplating]].
* [[Catalysts]] in a variety of chemical reactions.
* Metal [[alloys]].
* Electrical components, due to their predictable changes in [[electrical resistivity]] with regard to temperature.
* [[Superconductor|Superconductors]], as components in alloys with other metals.

==Biological role and toxicity==
Nickel has an important role in the biochemistry of organisms, as part of the active center of enzymes. None of the other group 10 elements have a known biological role, but platinum compounds have widely been used as anticancer drugs. Aside from nickel, the elements are toxic for organisms.
