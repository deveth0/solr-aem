&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grefsen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a neighbourhood of the city of [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].

Together with [[Kjelsås]], Grefsen was part of the borough &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grefsen-Kjelsås&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; until January 1, 2004, when they became part of the new borough of [[Nordre Aker]].
Grefsen and Kjelsås were also part of the former municipality of Aker before [[World War II|the Second World War]], when the city of Oslo was confined to today&amp;apos;s central areas.

The railway line [[Gjøvikbanen]] goes through the area, but [[Grefsen Station]] is actually located closer to the neighbourhood of Disen.

The Norwegian football club [[grefsen stadion|Kjelsas IL]] have their home [[stadium]] in Grefsen.

The mountain [[Grefsenåsen]] is named after the farm.

==The name==
The neighbourhood is named after the old farm Grefsen ([[Norse language|Norse]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grefsin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;*Grefsvin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). The first element is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;*grefs&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;steep hillside&amp;apos; (derived from the verb &amp;apos;&amp;apos;grafa&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;dig (out)&amp;apos;), the last element is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;vin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; f &amp;apos;meadow&amp;apos;. The old farm had [[Akerselva]] as its western border, and the hillside/riverside down to the river is very steep.

==People who have lived in Grefsen==
*[[Stein Erik Hagen]], former owner of the grocery chain [[RIMI]], grew up here.
*[[Halfdan Kjerulf]], composer.
