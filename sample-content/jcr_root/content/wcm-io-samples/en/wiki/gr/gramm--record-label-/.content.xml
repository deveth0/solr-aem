&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gramm&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[Iceland]]ic [[record label]] created by [[Ásmundur Jónsson]] and [[Einar Örn Benediktsson]] in [[1981 in music|1981]].

Located in [[Reykjavík]], Gramm’s first release was a 10-track 7&amp;quot; vinyl titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Tilf]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Purrkur Pillnikk]], a [[Punk rock|punk]] group led by Einar Örn.

Besides releasing all Purrkur Pillnikk’ records, Gramm also issued works of artists like the [[England|English]] experimental group [[Psychic TV]], [[Björk]]s first band [[Tappi Tíkarrass]]  and [[KUKL (band)|KUKL]] (featuring Björk and Einar Örn). There were others like the legendary rock band [[Þeyr]], punk groups such as [[Vonbrigði]] and others.

In [[1987 in music|1987]] Gramm went bankrupt. Ásmundur and some of the musicians who were playing in KUKL created Smekkleysa, that ultimately became [[Bad Taste (record label)|Bad Taste]], worldwide known by [[The Sugarcubes]].
