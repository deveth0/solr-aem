&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Green liberalism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a term used to refer to [[Liberalism|liberals]] who have incorporated [[Green politics|green]] concerns into their [[ideology]].

== Philosophy ==
Green liberalism values the [[Earth]] very highly, and this [[philosophy]] highly values the planet being passed down to the next generation unharmed.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://mqup.mcgill.ca/book.php?bookid=1701 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;How to be a Green Liberal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;], (Book synopsis), Author: Simon Hailwood, 2004. (Retrieved August 21, 2008.)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Green liberalism accepts that the [[Natural environment|natural world]] is a system in a state of [[flux]], and does not seek to conserve the natural world as it is. However, it does seek to minimize the damage done by the [[human]] species on the natural world, and to aid the regeneration of damaged areas.

In economic issues, green liberals take a position somewhere between [[classical liberalism]] and [[social liberalism]]: they may favor slightly less government involvement than do social liberals, but far more than do classical liberals. Some within the circle of green liberals practice [[free-market environmentalism]] and thus, sharing similarity with classical liberalism or [[libertarianism]]. This is one of a few reasons why a [[Blue-Green Alliance|blue-green alliance]] is possible in politics.

The historian [[Conrad Russell]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] member of the [[House of Lords]], dedicated a chapter of his book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Intelligent Person&amp;apos;s Guide to Liberalism&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to the subject of green liberalism. The term &amp;quot;green liberalism&amp;quot; was coined, however, by political philosopher Marcel Wissenburg in - among others - his 1998 book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Green Liberalism: The free and the green society&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The [[Liberal Party of Canada]] under [[StÃ©phane Dion]] placed the environment at the front of its political agenda, proposing an [[ecotax]] and [[tax shift]] it called the Green Shift. Similarly, the Liberal Democrats ([[UK]]) have proposed a &amp;quot;Green Tax Switch&amp;quot; based around the same ideas.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.libdems.org.uk/home/green-tax-switch-439116;show&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
