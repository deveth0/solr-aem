&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gravelines&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Lang-nl|Grevelingen}}) is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Nord (department)|Nord]] [[departments of France|department]] in [[Northern France]].

It lies at the mouth of the [[Aa River, France|river Aa]] 15 miles (25&amp;amp;nbsp;km) southwest of [[Dunkirk, France|Dunkirk]]. There is a market in the town square (Place Charles Valentin) on Fridays. The &amp;quot;Arsenal&amp;quot; approached from the town square is home to an extensive and carefully displayed art collection. There are modern bronze statues in the grounds.  The town is also home to French basketball club [[BCM Gravelines]].

==History==
[[File:0 Gravelines - Fort de Vauban (1).jpg|thumb|left|The moat, the drawbridge, the western walls and the bastion of the Mill.]]
In the early 12th century, [[Saint-Omer]] was an important port in western [[Flanders]]. However silting gradually cut it off from the [[North Sea]], resulting in the construction of a [[canal]] to the new coast at what is now Gravelines. The name is derived from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gravenenga&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, meaning Count&amp;apos;s Canal. The new town became heavily fortified as it guarded the western borders of [[Spain|Spanish]] territory in Flanders.

Gravelines was taken by [[Henry le Despenser]]&amp;apos;s English forces during the Norwich Crusade of 1383 and was that year destroyed on his orders as the English retreated towards Calais.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Allington-Smith, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Henry Despenser the Fighting Bishop&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, chapter 4&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

There was a famous Meeting at Gravelines in 1520, between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and [[Henry VIII of England]]. There were also [[Battle of Gravelines (disambiguation)|two battles]] fought nearby: [[Battle of Gravelines (1558)|the first]] was a land battle in 1558 resulting in a victory by Spanish forces of [[Count of Egmont|Lamoral, Count of Egmont]] over the [[France|French]] under Marshal [[Paul des Thermes]], while [[Naval battle of Gravelines|the second]] was a naval attack using [[fire ship]]s in 1588 launched by England&amp;apos;s [[Royal Navy]] under [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Lord Howard]] against the [[Spanish Armada]] at [[anchor]]. Gravelines was also the setting for [[Sir Philip Sidney]]&amp;apos;s failure to deliver the town from Spanish occupation in July 1586, which is described in the anonymous &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Discourse of the enterprise of Gravelines&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The town was captured and recaptured several times by the French and Spanish between 1639 and 1658, and finally annexed to France in the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] of 1659.

Only in the 19th century did the population become totally French speaking.
