The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Greystone&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Metro-North Railroad]] station serves the [[Greystone, Yonkers|Greystone]] neighborhood of [[Yonkers, New York]] via the [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]]. It is the northernmost station on the Hudson Line in Yonkers. Trains leave for [[New York City]] every 25 to 35 minutes on weekdays. It is {{convert|17.1|mi|km}} from [[Grand Central Terminal]] and travel time to Grand Central is about 41 minutes.

As of August 2006, daily commuter ridership was 513 and there are 250 parking spots.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news| title = Metro North Station Ridership| work =The New York Times| url = http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/commutemetro-north.html| accessdate = 2011-11-11}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
Greystone station was originally built in 1899 by developer Charles Harriman as &amp;quot;Harriman Station&amp;quot; for the [[New York Central and Hudson River Railroad]], who insisted that he rename the station &amp;quot;Greystone&amp;quot; in 1910. A pedestrian bridge was built in 1915. As with many NYCRR stations in Westchester County, the station became a [[Penn Central]] station upon the merger between NYC and [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] in 1968, until it was taken over by [[Conrail]] in 1976, and then by [[Metro-North Railroad]] in 1983.

==Platforms and tracks==
The station has two high-level [[side platform]]s, each eight cars long. The west platform next to Track 4 is generally used by southbound trains. The east platform next to Track 3 is generally used by northbound trains.

The Hudson Line has four tracks here; the two inner tracks not next to either platform are used by express trains.
