In [[ISO/IEC 646]] (commonly known as [[ASCII]]) and related standards including [[ISO 8859]] and [[Unicode]], a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;graphic character&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is any character intended to be written, printed, or otherwise displayed in a form that can be read by humans. In other words, it is any [[character encoding|encoded character]] that is associated with one or more [[glyph]]s.

==ISO/IEC 646==
In ISO 646, graphic characters are contained in rows 2 through 7 of the [[code]] table. However, two of the characters in these rows, namely the [[space character]] SP at row 2 column 0 and the [[delete character]]&amp;amp;nbsp;DEL (also called the rubout character) at row 7 column 15, require special mention.

The space is considered to be &amp;apos;&amp;apos;both&amp;apos;&amp;apos; a graphic character and a control character{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} in ISO 646; this is probably due to it having a visible form on [[computer terminal]]s but a control function (of moving the print head) on [[teletypes]]. {{or|date=February 2012}}

The delete character is strictly a control character, not a graphic character. This is true not only in ISO 646, but also in all related{{clarification needed|date=February 2012}} standards including Unicode. However, many modern character sets deviate from ISO 646, and as a result a graphic character might{{where|date=February 2012}} occupy the position originally reserved for the delete character.

==Unicode==
In Unicode, Graphic characters are those with [[Unicode character properties#General Category|General Category]] Letter, Mark, Number, Punctuation, Symbol or Zs=space. Other code points (General categories Control, Zl=line separator, Zp=paragraph separator) are Format, Control, Private Use, Surrogate, Noncharacter or Reserved (unassigned).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.2.0/ch02.pdf#G25564 Chapter 2, table 2.3&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Spacing and non-spacing characters ==
Most graphic characters are &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;spacing characters&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which means that each instance of a spacing character has to occupy some [[area]] in a graphic representation. For a [[teletype]] or a [[typewriter]] this implies moving of the carriage after typing of a character. In the context of [[text mode]] display, each spacing character occupy one rectangular character box of equal sizes. Or maybe two adjacent ones, for non-alphabetic [[CJK characters|characters of East Asian languages]]. If a text is [[font rendering|rendered]] using [[proportional font]]s, widths of character boxes are not equal, but are [[positive number|positive]].

There exists also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;non-spacing&amp;apos;&amp;apos; graphic characters. Most of non-spacing characters are &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[wikt:modifier|modifiers]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also called [[combining character]]s in Unicode, such as [[diacritic]]al marks. Although non-spacing graphic characters are uncommon in traditional [[code page]]s, there are many such in Unicode. A combining character has its distinct glyph, but it applies to a character box of another character, a spacing one. In some historical systems such as [[line printer]]s this was implemented as [[overstrike]].

Note that not all modifiers are non-spacing&amp;amp;nbsp;â€“ there exists [[Spacing Modifier Letters]] Unicode block.
