The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Great Western Railway&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{Reporting mark|GWRS}} is a [[Canada|Canadian]] short line railway company operating on former [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] trackage in southwest [[Saskatchewan]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web

In 2004 the railway was purchased by local investors from the area of Saskatchewan it serves. It is now locally owned and operated. Great Western Railway continues to serve many producer loading sites along their entire railnetwork, but also provide railcar storage for Class I railways and railcare companies.

The Great Western Railway line network consists of 471&amp;amp;nbsp;km, when combined with the Fife Lake Railway (97&amp;amp;nbsp;km) and [[Red Coat Road and Rail]] (114&amp;amp;nbsp;km) the resulting network is  682&amp;amp;nbsp;km.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.highways.gov.sk.ca/adx/aspx/adxGetMedia.aspx?DocID=333,328,81,1,Documents&amp;amp;MediaID=2592&amp;amp;Filename=railnetwork2010.pdf Saskatchewan Railway Network 2010]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Engine Roster==

Great Western Railway had humble beginnings hauling hopper cars of grain for small  producer loading sites, but as Great Western Railway gradually gained trackage rights over Red Coat Road &amp;amp; Rail and Fife Lake Railway, the railway required more motive power to provide sufficient customer service for their new customers. Up until 2011, Great Western Railway utilized an all [[MLW M-420W|MLW M420]] roster; however with the increased maintenance cost of operating Montreal Locomotive Works locomotives, Great Western Railway decided to purchase their first General Electric units. In March 2011 it was announced Great Western Railway would receive two former Burlington Northern Santa Fe GE B40-8Ws for the original Great Western route.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web| title = Canadian Railway Observations March 2011 | accessdate =2011-05-11}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
The shorter branch lines that are owned by Red Coat Road &amp;amp; Rail and Fife Lake Railway will continue to utilize three M420s, while GWRS will sell off two of their MLW locomotives.
