&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Groundbreaking&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;cutting&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;sod-cutting&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;turning the first sod&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;sod-turning ceremony&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a traditional [[ceremony]] in many cultures that celebrates the first day of [[construction]] for a [[building]] or other project.  Such ceremonies are often attended by dignitaries such as [[politician]]s and [[business]]men.  The actual [[shovel]] or spade used during the actual groundbreaking is often a special ceremonial shovel meant to be saved for subsequent display.  Commemorative information may be subsequently engraved on the shovel.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ceremonial&amp;apos;&amp;apos; groundbreakings often precede the actual start of construction by many months.

In some places, [[clergy]] may also provide [[blessing]]s, particularly if the building is being constructed by a church or religious-affiliated organization.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
