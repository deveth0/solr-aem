{{Green politics sidebar |Pillars}}

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grassroots democracy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a tendency towards designing [[politics|political]] processes where as much decision-making authority as practical is shifted to the organization&amp;apos;s lowest geographic level of organization: principle of [[subsidiarity]].{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

To cite a specific hypothetical example, a national grassroots organization would place as much decision-making power as possible in the hands of a local chapter instead of the head office.  The principle is that for [[democracy|democratic]] power to be best exercised it must be vested in a local &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;community&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; instead of isolated, atomized individuals, essentially making it the opposite of national supremacy.  As such, [[grassroots]] organizations exist in contrast to so-called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Participatory democracy|participatory systems]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which tend to allow individuals equal access to decision-making irrespective of their standing in a local community, or which particular community they reside in.  As well, grassroots systems also differ from [[republic|representative]] systems that allow local communities or national memberships to elect representatives who then go on to make decisions.

The difference between the three systems comes down to where they rest on two different axes:  the rootedness in a community (i.e. grassroots versus national or international);  and the ability of all individuals to participate in the decision-making process (i.e. participatory versus representative.)
