&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Great Marlow&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] within [[Wycombe district]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Buckinghamshire]] located north of the town of [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] and south of [[High Wycombe]].  The parish includes the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]] of [[Bovingdon Green, Buckinghamshire|Bovingdon Green]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Burroughs Grove&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chisbridge Cross&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marlow Common&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and [[Danesfield Base]], a [[housing estate]] for [[RAF]] officers.  Prior to November 2007 the major settlement in Great Marlow was [[Marlow Bottom]] which has now become a civil parish in its own right.

The parish has been so named since Norman times.  The ancient parish of Great Marlow, named to distinguish it from [[Little Marlow]], was large, including the town of Marlow and rural areas north and west of the town.  The ancient parish became a civil parish in the 19th century, and in 1896 the civil parish was divided.  The town became Great Marlow Urban District (later renamed [[Marlow Urban District]]), leaving the rural areas in the parish of Great Marlow.&amp;lt;ref name=vch&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42531 |title=Parishes: Great Marlow |author=William Page (editor) |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |date=1925 |work=A History of the County of Buckingham: Volume 3 |accessdate=14 July 2011 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  In 1934 [[Lane End, Buckinghamshire|Lane End]], in the far north of the parish, was transferred from Great Marlow to the parish of [[Fingest]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10009753&amp;amp;c_id=10001043 Vision of Britain website]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The [[ecclesiastical parish]] of Great Marlow, which includes the town of Marlow, is now united with the parishes of Marlow Bottom, Little Marlow and [[Bisham]] (in [[Berkshire]]).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.oxford.anglican.org/documents/Marlow%20Parish%20Profile.pdf Parish Profile, February 2010]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
