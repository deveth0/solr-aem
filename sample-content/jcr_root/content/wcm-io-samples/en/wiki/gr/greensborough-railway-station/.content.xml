==Station overview==

===Facilities===

Greensborough is located between Para Road and Poulter Avenue, with station access from both. [[Greensborough Plaza]] is a short walk from the station.

The station consists of two platforms, in an [[Island platform|island format]] (platforms are not aligned though). The [[island platform]] has a large brick building housing an enclosed waiting area, ticket facilities and toilets. A large [[Metcard]] ticket vending machine is located inside the waiting area, which is able to dispense most ticketing options available and also accept notes and coins. Additional coin only Metcard &amp;amp; [[myki]] ticket vending machines are also located inside the waiting area. A footbridge is located at the [[Flinders Street Station|Flinders Street]] end of the station.

Greensborough marks the end of the [[double track]] section of the Hurstbridge line. Trains travelling further down the line can face delays of up to 10 minutes at Greensborough when late trains towards the city occupy the [[single track (rail)|single track]] section between [[Eltham railway station, Melbourne|Eltham]] and Greensborough.

Numerous weekday services in [[peak hour]]s from the Melbourne CBD terminate Greensborough, as do extra services provided on the Hurstbridge line for major events, which with the exception of [[New Years Eve]] services, are only normally provided as far as Greensborough.
