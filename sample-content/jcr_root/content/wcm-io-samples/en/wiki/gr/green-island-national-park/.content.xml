== Park features ==
[[Green Island (Queensland)|Green Island]] is a true coral cay formed over thousands of years by the build-up of sand and coral rubble deposited on the calm side of a platform reef.  The island is covered in tropical vine forest which supports a diversity of birds and insects.  The surrounding coral reef is home to many kinds of corals, clams, fish, stingrays and other reef life.  Green and hawksbill turtles are seen offshore.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;QPWS01&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; More than 60 species of bird are found on the island.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;xqnp&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=Explore Queensland&amp;apos;s National Parks |year=2008 |publisher=Explore Australia Publishing |location=Prahran, Victoria |isbn=978-1-74117-245-4 |pages=22 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Green Island has been a popular tourist resort for more than a century.  The island became a national park in 1937,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;xqnp&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; a marine park in 1974 and part of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area in 1981.  Today the island, reef and beaches are managed together as a recreation area.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;QPWS01&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Camping on the island is not permitted.  A small luxury resort is built on the island with daily ferry services providing access.
