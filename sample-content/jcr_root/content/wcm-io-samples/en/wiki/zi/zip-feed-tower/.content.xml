The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zip Feed Tower&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[grain elevator]] and [[feed mill]] in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]. At 202 feet (62 meters)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=251603 Emporis.com: Zip Feed Mill]. Accessed August 4, 2006.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; it was the tallest occupiable structure in [[South Dakota]] from its construction in 1956â€“57 until its demolition in December 2005. The mill closed in 2000 and in 2005 was scheduled for demolition to make way for office and retail space.

== Attempted demolition ==
On December 3, 2005 workers unsuccessfully attempted to [[Building implosion|implode]] the building.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.argusleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051203/NEWS/51203001/1001 Zip still standing], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Argus Leader]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. December 3, 2005.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The concrete tower fell into its own [[basement]], leaning to one side but still standing. Demolition crews had attempted to drop the structure by cutting reinforcing bars throughout the structure then placing explosive charges in a ring around the base and up between the vertical silos.  However, the integrity of the structure was such that, as the base was sheared off, the main structure dropped straight down crashing through the damaged base into the lower chambers (i.e. the basement).

A review of the demolition project proved that the crew had seriously underestimated the amount of cutting explosive required to &amp;quot;break&amp;quot; the structure&amp;apos;s vertical integrity. Over the next two weeks a [[crane (machine)|crane]] and [[wrecking ball]] were used to complete the demolition.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.siouxfalls.org/Information/webcam_falls/tip_zip.aspx Siouxfalls.org: Tip the Zip]. Accessed August 4, 2006.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The tallest building in Sioux Falls today is the 11-story [[CenturyLink Tower (Sioux Falls)|CenturyLink Tower]].
