&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zizi Jeanmaire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 29 April 1924) is a [[France|French]] ballet dancer and widow of renowned dancer and choreographer [[Roland Petit]]. She became famous in the 1950s after playing the title role in the ballet &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Carmen (1949 ballet)|Carmen]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, produced in London in 1949, and went on to appear in several Hollywood films.

==Background==
Born in Paris, France, as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Renée Marcelle Jeanmaire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, she met her future husband and long-time collaborator [[Roland Petit]] at the [[Paris Opera Ballet]] at the age of nine. She joined his company, Petit&amp;apos;s ballets de Paris in 1949. In 1954 they married, and their successful shows put her on the road to stardom. This led to a brief stint in Hollywood (where she was credited simply as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jeanmaire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), appearing in the musicals &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hans Christian Andersen (film)|Hans Christian Andersen]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1952) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Anything Goes (1956 film)|Anything Goes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1956). After that, she concentrated on ballet, producing more than 60 shows with Petit. From the 1960s on, she also had a career in music with such hits as &amp;quot;Mon truc en plumes&amp;quot;.

She and Petit had one daughter, Valentine Petit, a dancer and actress.[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/arts/dance/roland-petit-choreographer-is-dead-at-87.html][http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/entertainment-arts-14099910][http://www.corbisimages.com/stock-photo/rights-managed/0000248598-014/zizi-jeanmaire-with-daughter-valentine-petit/?ext=1]

She is mentioned in the lyrics of the song by [[Peter Sarstedt]], [[Where Do You Go To My Lovely]], in the first line &amp;quot;You talk like [[Marlene Dietrich]], you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire / Your clothes are all made by Balmain and you&amp;apos;ve diamonds and pearls in your hair&amp;quot;.
