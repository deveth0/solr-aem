[[Image:Zinovi Pechkoff.jpg|thumb|French general Zinovy Peshkov, 1926]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zinovy Alekseyevich Peshkov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Зиновий Алексеевич Пешков}}, {{lang-fr|Zinovi Pechkoff}} or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pechkov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 16 October 1884 &amp;amp;mdash; 27 November 1966) was a [[Russia]]n-born [[France|French]] general and diplomat.

==Early life==

Born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yeshua Zalman Sverdlov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Russified name: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zinovy Mikhailovich Sverdlov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,  Зиновий Михайлович Свердлов) to a [[Jew]]ish engraver in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], he was an older brother of [[Yakov Sverdlov]] (subsequently a [[Bolshevik]] party leader and a high [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] official). In 1896, [[Maxim Gorky]] met the Sverdlov family at an exhibition and soon became a close friend. During Gorky&amp;apos;s exile to [[Arzamas]] in 1902, Zinovy worked as his secretary.
To evade [[Tsarist Russia]]n [[Pale of Settlement|restrictions for Jews]] to live in big cities, Zinovy Sverdlov was [[Baptism|baptized]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and officially changed his name. Gorky (real name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alexey Peshkov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) became his [[godparent|godfather]].

Zinovy Peshkov was disowned by his family and in 1904 he emigrated to [[Canada]]. After two years, he joined Gorky in [[Capri]].

==World War I and post-war==

After the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, he volunteered for the [[French Army]]. In May 1915, he was wounded and his right arm was amputated. In 1916, as a successful officer, he was sent to the [[United States]] to agitate for the country&amp;apos;s entry into the War. After being decorated with the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Légion d&amp;apos;honneur]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1917, Peshkov worked in French diplomatic missions in Russia, [[Romania]], [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Georgia]].

In the periods 1921-1926 and 1937-1940 he served in the [[French Foreign Legion]] in [[French Morocco]], and wrote a book about his experiences there. In 1926-1937, he served in the Foreign Ministry in France and in the [[French Mandate of Lebanon]].

==World War II and post-war==

During [[World War II]], Zinovy Peshkov fought the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] forces in Morocco and in [[Syria]]. In 1940, he joined [[Charles de Gaulle]]&amp;apos;s [[Free French Forces]] government in [[London]] exile, and soon was sent as a French [[ambassador]] to [[South Africa]], where he organized arms shipments for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. After his 1943 promotion to the title of [[Brigadier General]], Peshkov served as French ambassador to the [[Republic of China]] and, after 1946, to [[Japan]]. In 1964 he participated in negotiations with [[Chiang Kai-shek]] regarding [[Taiwan]].

Zinovy Peshkov died in [[Paris]] and was buried at the [[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery]].
