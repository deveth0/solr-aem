&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ZIL-114&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[automobile|car]] from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Zavod Imeni Likhacheva|ZIL]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; introduced in 1970&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Dutton, E.P., &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The New Encyclopedia of Motorcars&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 3rd edition; page 680. Published 1982 by George Rainbird Limited&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; to replace the [[ZIL-111]] series which was gradually becoming out of date.

In almost all respects, the ZIL-114 improved on the 111, 111A and 111G models. The engine, still a ZIL-designed and built [[pushrod]] [[V8 engine|V8]], was increased in capacity from 5980 cc (365 cubic inches) to 6962 cc (425 cubic inches), resulting in an increase of power by 30 percent and of maximum speed from approximately 170&amp;amp;nbsp;km/h (106 miles per hour) to 200&amp;amp;nbsp;km/h (124 miles per hour). The outdated styling of previous ZILs was also gone, to be replaced by more modern styling, especially at the front where the cross-hatched radiator grille was discarded for a mesh style. The headlamps also showed a major development with four circular headlamps replacing the twin headlamps in the front wings.

Although the rigid rear axle with [[leaf spring]]s was retained, the ZIL-114 saw the replacement of [[drum brake|drums]] by power-assisted [[disc brake]]s on all four wheels to cope with the hugely powerful engine. There were more luxury appointments than found on previous ZIL models, with such features as [[air conditioning]] added to the furnishings of the ZIL-111.

The 114 continued in limited production until the late 1970s when it was replaced by the even larger and heavier [[ZIL-4104]], which continues more or less to the present.

The [[ZIL-117]] was a short-chassis version with only five seats and a much shorter wheelbase. It was also available as an unusual four-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]] (like the ZIL-111V)
