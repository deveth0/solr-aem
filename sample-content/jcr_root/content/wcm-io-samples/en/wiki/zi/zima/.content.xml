&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zima&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a clear, lightly [[carbonation|carbonated]], [[alcoholic beverage]], that is made and distributed by the [[Coors Brewing Company]], ultimately [[MillerCoors]]. Introduced in 1993, it was marketed not as a [[beer]], but as an alternative to beer, an early example of what is now often referred to as [[alcopop]]. Its domestic production ceased in October 2008, but it is still marketed in Japan.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =|title = ZIMA| work =| publisher =Gigazine| date =2010-03-28| url = http://gigazine.net/news/20100329_zima_lip_cap/| doi =| accessdate = 2011-02-16 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
[[wikt:zima|Zima]] means &amp;quot;winter&amp;quot; in [[Slavic languages]]. TV writer [[Jane Espenson]] came up with the name.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.popmyculturepodcast.com/2012/pmc-76-jane-espenson/ Pop My Culture podcast 76]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was launched nationally in the [[United States]] as Zima Clearmalt in 1993 after being test-marketed two years earlier in the cities of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. The lemon-lime drink was part of the &amp;quot;clear craze&amp;quot; of the 1990s that produced products such as [[Crystal Pepsi]] and [[Tab Clear]].&amp;lt;ref name=slate&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2204596/ |title=The Long, Slow, Torturous Death of Zima |last1=Koerner |first1=Brendan |date=November 26, 2008 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The slogans used in early advertisements for Zima were &amp;quot;a truly unique alcohol beverage&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Zomething different&amp;quot;.

Zima offered an alternative to the then-successful [[wine cooler]] category, and it became very popular. Coors spent $50 million marketing Zima in its first year, persuading nearly half of American alcohol drinkers to try it. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Brandweek]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; magazine reported that at Zima&amp;apos;s peak in 1994, 1.2 million barrels of the beverage were sold. Originally popular among young women, Coors made its first attempt at attracting young men to the brand in 1995 by marketing Zima Gold, an amber-colored beverage that promised a &amp;quot;taste of bourbon&amp;quot;; the drink was unpopular and disappeared from store shelves within the year.&amp;lt;ref name=slate/&amp;gt;

Zima was associated with [[rumor]]s claiming that the beverage did not contain alcohol or that its alcohol content would not register on alcohol-breath-test equipment;&amp;lt;ref name=slate/&amp;gt; the myths were alleged to have improved the beverage&amp;apos;s popularity among teenagers.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Mikkelson, Barbara (October 26, 2008). [http://www.snopes.com/autos/law/breath.asp &amp;quot;Take My Breath Away&amp;quot;]. [[Snopes]].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In describing &amp;quot;The Long, Slow, Torturous Death of Zima&amp;quot;, writer Brendan Koerner cited Zima&amp;apos;s perceived reputation as a &amp;quot;girly-man&amp;quot; beverage and its persistent parodization by late-night TV host [[David Letterman]].&amp;lt;ref name=slate/&amp;gt;  The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Chicago Tribune]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; quoted distributors ordered to stock &amp;quot;caffeinated alcoholic beverage [[Sparks (drink)|Sparks]] on retail store shelves to make up for Zimaâ€™s absence&amp;quot;.

Competitors to Zima in the U.S. have included [[Miller Brewing|Miller&amp;apos;s]] Qube and [[Stroh Brewery Company|Stroh&amp;apos;s]] Clash, which are no longer made today. In 2000, [[Smirnoff]] launched [[Smirnoff Ice]], which outsold Zima in its later years.

In the late 2000s, the beverage was marketed in three additional flavors: citrus, tangerine, and pineapple citrus.&amp;lt;ref name=slate/&amp;gt; In addition, black cherry and green apple flavors were also marketed.

On October 20, 2008, MillerCoors LLC announced that it had discontinued production of Zima, choosing instead to focus on other &amp;quot;malternative&amp;quot; beverages.&amp;lt;ref name=slate/&amp;gt;
