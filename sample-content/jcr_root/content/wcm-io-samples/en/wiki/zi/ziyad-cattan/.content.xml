        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ziyad Cattan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a dual citizen of [[Poland]] and [[Iraq]].

According to an article published in [[The Independent]] (UK), on September 19, 2005, [[Hazim al-Shaalan]], Defense Minister of [[Iyad Allawi]]&amp;apos;s interim administration, appointed Ziyad Cattan, as the Defence Ministry&amp;apos;s procurement chief.

The Independent article describes massive fraud in the Defense Ministry&amp;apos;s procurement, which it describes as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;the greatest theft in history&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which occurred under Cattan&amp;apos;s watch.  Of expenditures of between $1 and $2 billion the article estimates only $200 million worth of usable equipment was purchased.

Cattan and his former boss al-Shaalan, are both living in [[Jordan]], and refusing comment.
