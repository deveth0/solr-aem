It operated a fleet of 12 [[Boeing 737]] aircraft, each painted in a bright, [[neon]] colour ([[blue]], [[fuchsia]], [[green]], and [[Orange (colour)|orange]]) with a single class of service.  The subsidiary was headed by former [[WestJet]] CEO, Steve Smith.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Pigg, Susan. &amp;quot;[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/421016591.html?dids=421016591:421016591&amp;amp;FMT=ABS&amp;amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;amp;type=current&amp;amp;date=Jan+22%2C+2003&amp;amp;author=Susan+Pigg&amp;amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;amp;desc=Zip%2C+WestJet+in+fare+war+that+could+hurt+them+both+%3B+Move+follows+competition+bureau+ruling+Battle+could+intensify+when+Zip+flies+eastward&amp;amp;pqatl=google Zip, WestJet in fare war that could hurt them both ; Move follows competition bureau ruling Battle could intensify when Zip flies eastward].&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Toronto Star]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

As a direct competition to Canada&amp;apos;s leading [[low-cost carrier]] WestJet, Zip flew mostly between the western cities of [[Abbotsford Airport|Abbotsford]], [[Calgary International Airport|Calgary]], [[Edmonton International Airport|Edmonton]], [[Vancouver International Airport|Vancouver]], [[Saskatoon Airport|Saskatoon]], [[Regina International Airport|Regina]] and [[Winnipeg International Airport|Winnipeg]].

Zip ceased operations in September 2004 when Air Canada resumed a full schedule on its western routes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Branding==

Among them, &amp;quot;yuk&amp;quot; was printed on the air sickness bags, &amp;quot;bag&amp;quot; was printed on the personal baggage tags, and &amp;quot;yum&amp;quot; was printed on the napkins distributed with beverages on board. Large print advertisements were erected in many cities, which simply said &amp;quot;fly&amp;quot; and the company&amp;apos;s website below, 4321zip.com
