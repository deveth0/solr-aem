&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The castle at Ziwiyeh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which has been ruined through digging for archaeological purposes, was an ancient and strong building situated on the top of a mount above the wide Ziwiyeh Cave, [[Iran]].  It is located in an altitude of 1,835 m above sea level in [[Kurdistan Province (Iran)|Kurdistan province of Iran]] on the south of [[Lake Urmia]].  Artefacts found there belong to the 9th century BC (belonging to [[Medes]] era) and have been kept in some museums.  A large golden [[necklace]] with some mythical animals engraved on it is one of the most famous things found in the area.
