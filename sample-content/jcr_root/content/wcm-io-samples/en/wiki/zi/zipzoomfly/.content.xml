        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ZipZoomfly&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an internet retailer for computer parts and related products.  Based in [[Newark, California]], ZipZoomfly was founded in May 1999 under the name XtraPlus. The site relaunched in January 2000 as Googlegear. ZipZoomfly is a U.S. [[service mark]] of Xtraplus Corporation.

== Name change ==
A formal complaint by [[Google]] to an [[ICANN]] domain-name dispute resolution provider led to the company changing its name from Googlegear to ZipZoomFly in 2003.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2001/d2001-0125.html Google, Inc. v. Xtraplus Corp] (2001-05-16).  [[WIPO]] Arbitration and Mediation Center. Case No. D2001-0125. Retrieved on 2006-12-07.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The domain &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;googlegear.com&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is now owned by Google, and &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;http://www.googlegear.com&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; redirects to a Google page explaining that Googlegear has never been associated with Google and provides a link to zipzoomfly.com.

== Mascot ==
The original mascot of Googlegear was a smiling bean-shaped cartoon character as the first letter &amp;quot;O&amp;quot; in the name.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;amp;entry=76066286 U. S. Patent and Trademark Office], Retrieved on 2007-01-27&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Named GoogleGuy, the mascot was shown giving a thumbs-up sign with one of his two floating hands. The U.S. trademark filing describes GoogleGuy as an edible nut without a shell. Nevertheless, the website claimed that GoogleGuy was neither a bean nor a pancake, but a numeral &amp;quot;zero&amp;quot; from the virtual googol of products they carried.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20000510151906/www.googlegear.com/cgi-bin/xp/company/googleguy Archive.org cache of Googlegear.com], Retrieved on 2007-01-27&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The mascot still appears in the logo for ZipZoomfly.

== Claims of fraud ==
Several customers have confirmed&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.consumeraffairs.com/online/zipzoomfly.html, Retrieved on 2011-12-11&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; ZipZoomFly of committing &amp;quot;rebate fraud&amp;quot; or promising good deals on technology once rebates are applied. Several reports have indicated that the company often fails to follow up on rebates, often making false claims of refunding money lost through rebate fraud.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.resellerratings.com/store/ZipZoomFly, Retrieved on 2011-01-03&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Zipzoomfly was also &amp;quot;notorious&amp;quot; for selling broken and or used parts as new and then refusing to provide a refund.

On January 5, 2011, this company&amp;apos;s Better Business Bureau (BBB) accreditation was revoked due to failure to respond to one or more customer complaints filed with the BBB.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.bbb.org/greater-san-francisco/business-reviews/video-equipment-supplies-and-parts/zipzoomflycom-in-newark-ca-26523#ratingdetails&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

{{As of|November 2011}}, the company&amp;apos;s BBB rating was once again listed as their highest rating: A+.
Their web site has been continuously marked &amp;quot;closed for maintenance&amp;quot; since August 21, 2011.

{{As of|March 2012}}, the website has been updated to read:

{{quote|Dear ZipZoomFly shoppers, We apologize for the inconvenience. Please come back later.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Thank you - NM80}}

{{As of|May 2012}}, the website has been taken offline.
