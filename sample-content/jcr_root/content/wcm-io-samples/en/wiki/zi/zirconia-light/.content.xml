        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;zirconia light&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an intensely brilliant chemical light produced by incandescent [[zirconium]].  It was more commonly used in the days before electric lamps. It is similar in design to the [[Limelight]]. It is similar to the Drummond light, but differing from it chiefly in the employment of cones of zirconium instead of cylinders of lime; it has been superseded by the electric light.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Influence of crystal structure on the light scatter of zirconium oxide films&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;lt;/big&amp;gt;The relationship of light scatter by a thin film to thin-film morphology is examined. Light scatter by reactively evaporated ZrO2 thin films is analyzed by using in situ total internal reflection microscopy and angle-resolved scatterometry. Film crystal structure is analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. Relations between film crystal structure and film scatter are established by using this information. Surface topography is analyzed by the use of scanning force microscopy. Results of a spectrophotometric determination of the film refractive index are reported. The film scatter is found to be sensitive to the crystal phase of the film, which is a function of substrate deposition temperature.
