A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;zippie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a person who does something for nothing.  Any supporter of free culture, free food, free books, free software is a zippie.

The origin of the word is an evolution of the term [[yippie]], which was coined by the [[Youth International Party]] in the 1960s.  In subsequent years, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zippie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  has arisen in reference to 1990s technopeople, in contradiction to [[yuppie]]s. In the 1990s, [[Fraser Clark]] and others created a unique [[subculture]] that combined the &amp;quot;1990s techno hemisphere with the 1960s earth person&amp;quot;.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==1972==
Zippies reached international prominence during the American 1972 [[Democratic National Convention]] and 1972 [[Republican National Convention]], held in Miami Beach, Florida, USA, when the word was silk-screened on t-shirts and worn by counter-culture activists and groups working to end the US involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Elliott, John, &amp;quot;Trial By Fire&amp;quot;, article in Cyrano&amp;apos;s Journal Magazine, p. 7 photo &amp;quot;https://acrobat.com/app.html#d=gl72kKbtSzCFW2CNOG-L3w&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==1994==
In May 1994 [[Wired Magazine]] published an article titled &amp;quot;Here Come the Zippies!&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Marshall, Jules, &amp;quot;[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.05/zippies.html Zippies!]&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wired Magazine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, issue 2.05, May 1994&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The cover of the magazine featured a kaleidoscopic image of a smiling young man with wild hair, a funny hat, and mechanical eyeglasses. Written by [[Jules Marshall]], the article announced an organized cultural response to [[Thatcherism]] in the [[British Isles]].

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;There&amp;apos;s a new and rapidly spreading cultural virus ripping through the British Isles. The symptoms of those infected include attacks of optimism, strong feelings of community, and lowered stress levels. Will their gathering in August at the Grand Canyon be the Woodstock of the &amp;apos;90s?&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

The article describes zippies, according to 50-year-old Fraser Clark, as &amp;quot;Zen-Inspired Pronoia Professional&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;hippies with zip.&amp;quot; The [[United Kingdom|UK]] media tried to pin various labels on the Y Generation such as &amp;quot;cyber-crusties&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;[[Electrohippies|techno-hippies]]&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;post-ravers.&amp;quot; [[Fraser Clark]] espoused a philosophy known as [[Pronoia (psychology)|pronoia]] and embarked on an expedition to the [[United States]]. This tour was dubbed the [[Wired (magazine)#History|Zippy Pronoia Tour to US]].  Other uses of the term are &amp;quot;Zen Inspired Peace Professional.&amp;quot;
These zippies were a [[New Age]] kind of [[hippie]] who embraced Chaos Theory, Blakean revolt, modern mysteries such as New Age [[Paganism]], [[trance music]], [[rave]] culture, [[smart drinks]], [[Free Software|free software]], technology and [[entrepreneur]]ism in an effort to bring about a better world.

A group called &amp;quot;The Zippies&amp;quot; were behind one of the first acts of electronic civil disobedience with a [[Intervasion of the UK|collective online action against the 1994 Criminal Justice Bill]].

==2004==
In his book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The World is Flat]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Thomas L. Friedman]] describe zippies as a &amp;quot;huge cohort of Indian youth who are first to come of the age since India shifted away from socialism and dived headfirst into global trade and information revolution by turning itself into world&amp;apos;s service center&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Thomas|title=The World is Flat|year=2006|publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=978-374-29279-9|pages=216}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The original source of the 2004 term &amp;quot;Zippies&amp;quot; comes from an Indian English-language weekly magazine called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in an article called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Age Of The Zippie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|last=SINHA|first=SUVEEN|title=Age Of The Zippie|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?222577|publisher=Outlook India|accessdate=2012-06-19}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
