&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ziri ibn Manad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (died 971) was founder of the [[Zirid]] dynasty in the [[Maghreb]].

Ziri ibn Manad was a clan leader of the [[Berber people|Berber]] [[Sanhaja]] tribe who, as an ally of the [[Fatimids]], defeated the rebellion of [[Abu Yazid]] (943–947). His reward was the governorship of the western provinces, an area that roughly corresponds with modern [[Algeria]] north of the [[Sahara]].

Ziri had the residence of [[Ashir]] built south of the future site of [[Algiers]] in 935, in which endeavour he was supported by the Fatimids with craftsmen and architects. His son [[Buluggin ibn Ziri]] founded the cities of [[Algiers]], [[Miliana]] and [[Medea]] (Lamdiya), as well as rebuilding settlements destroyed in the revolt.

Ziri ibn Manad fell in battle against rebellious Berber tribes in [[Morocco]]. He was succeeded as governor by his son [[Buluggin ibn Ziri]], who in 972 became Viceroy of [[Ifriqiya]] (972–984) when the Fatimids transferred their court to [[Egypt]].
