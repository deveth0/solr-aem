&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ghettotech&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or Detroit club music is a form of [[electronic dance music |electronic music]] originating from [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. It combines elements of Chicago&amp;apos;s [[ghetto house]] with [[electro (music)|electro]], [[glitch (music)|glitch]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Techno music|techno]]. It is usually faster than most other dance music genres, at roughly 145 to 170 bpm, and sometimes features [[pornographic]] lyrics. As [[DJ Godfather]] puts it, &amp;quot;the beats are really gritty, really raw, nothing polished.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;XLR8R TV Episode 13: Detroit Ghettotech. 14 Aug. 2007. &amp;lt;http://youtube.com/watch?v=NGFpF6vCV18&amp;amp;feature=related&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Ghettotech was born as a DJing style, inspired by the eclecticism of [[The Electrifying Mojo]] and the fast-paced mixing and turntablism of [[Jeff Mills|The Wizard]], with DJs mixing genres including [[Miami bass]], [[ghetto house]], [[Electro music|electro]], [[Glitch music|glitch]], [[hip hop]] and [[Detroit techno]]. The general BPM of the music&amp;apos;s mixing style increased over time. Moving into 2011, ghettotech is finding a strong resurgence, [[tech house]] being an influence.

Ghettotech is an integral part of the [[Detroit Electronic Music Festival]], an annual event. A Detroit ghettotech style of dancing is called the jit. It is an improvisational dance that mainly centers around the fast movement of the feet. Chicago&amp;apos;s equivalent dance style is Juke, where the focus is on the footwork dating back to the late 1980s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;XLR8R TV Episode 13: Detroit Ghettotech. 14 Aug. 2007. &amp;lt;http://youtube.com/watch?v=NGFpF6vCV18&amp;amp;feature=related&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
