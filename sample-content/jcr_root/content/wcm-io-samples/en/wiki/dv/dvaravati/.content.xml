{{History of Thailand}}
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dvaravati&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-th|ทวารวดี}}, {{RTGS|Thawarawadi}}) period lasted from the 6th to the 13th centuries. Dvaravati refers to both a culture and a disparate conglomerate of principalities.

== History ==
By the 10th century, Dvaravati began to come under the influence of the [[Khmer Empire]] and central [[Thailand]] was ultimately invaded by the Khmer king [[Suryavarman II]] in the first half of the 12th century.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |title=The Mon-Dvaravati Tradition of Early North-Central Thailand |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mond/hd_mond.htm|accessdate=2009-12-15}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Haripunchai]] survived its southern progenitors until the late 13th century AD. when it was incorporated in the [[Lanna]] Kingdom.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[David K. Wyatt]] and Aroonrut Wichienkeeo. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Chiang Mai Chronicle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p.33&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The people of the region used the ancient [[Mon language]], but whether they were ethnically [[Mon people|Mon]] is unknown. There is evidence that these principalities may comprise many cultural groups of people, including [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] and [[Khmer people|Khmers]]. The theory of Thai migration into Dvaravati has been refuted and is now known to have happened much later.

The term Dvaravati derives from coins which were inscribed in [[Sanskrit]] with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[śrī]] dvāravatī&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The Sanskrit word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;dvāravatī&amp;apos;&amp;apos; means &amp;quot;she with many gates&amp;quot; (from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;dvar&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;door gate&amp;quot;). Its name may derive from the city of [[Dwaraka Kingdom|Dvāraka]] in ancient India.

Little is known about the administration of Dvaravati. It might simply have been a loose gathering of principalities rather than a centralised state, expanding from the coastal area of the upper peninsula to the riverine region of [[Chao Phraya]] river. [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] were significant. The main settlements appear to have been at [[Nakhon Pathom Province|Nakhon Pathom]], [[Amphoe U Thong|U Thong]] and [[Khu Bua]] west of the Chao Phraya. Other towns like Lavo (modern-day [[Lopburi]]) or [[Si Thep]] were also clearly influenced by the Dvaravati culture, but probably were not part of the Dvaravati state.

Dvaravati itself was heavily influenced by [[India]]n culture, and played an important role in introducing [[Buddhism]] and particularly [[Buddhist art]] to the region.
