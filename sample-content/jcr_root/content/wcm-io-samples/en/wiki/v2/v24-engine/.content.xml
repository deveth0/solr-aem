A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;V24 engine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[V engine]] with 24 [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]s, suitable only for very large [[truck]]s or [[locomotive]]s.

Unlike smaller V16 and V20 engines, very few V24s were originally designed with 24 cylinders. The majority of these engines are formed by coupling multiple smaller engines together. For example, a very large V24, the [[Fiat AS.6|AS.6]], engine was built by [[Fiat]] in the early 1930s as a [[powerplant]] for the competition aeroplane [[Macchi M.C.72]]. This engine was in reality formed by mounting two [[Fiat AS.5]] V12s, one behind the other, obtaining a total displacement of over {{convert|50|L|cuin|0}} and a power output of about {{convert|3100|hp|kW|-1}}. The two units remained separated (they could be started separately) but the output shaft was shared. Between the units sat the [[gearbox]] that was used to reduce the propeller speed, and the final output shaft ran between the cylinder banks of the front engine to reach the nose of the aeroplane.

The Detroit Diesel [[Detroit Diesel Series 71|24V-71]] is an example of a modern, two-stroke V24 Diesel engine. It is capable of producing 1,800 horsepower from a 27.9 liter displacement.
