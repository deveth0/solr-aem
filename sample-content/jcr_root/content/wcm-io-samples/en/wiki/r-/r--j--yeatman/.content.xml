&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Robert Julian Yeatman&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (15 July 1897 &amp;amp;ndash; 13 July 1968) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[humorist]] who wrote for [[Punch magazine|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Punch&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]]. He is best known for the book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[1066 and All That]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1930, ISBN 0-413-77270-5), a tongue-in-cheek guide to &amp;quot;all the history you can remember&amp;quot;, which he wrote with [[W. C. Sellar]].

He was born in [[Oporto]], the principal city and port of northern Portugal, where his father was a wine merchant, a family business connected with [[Taylor&amp;apos;s Port]]. Yeatman had won the [[Military Cross]] in World War I before going to [[Oriel College, Oxford]] where he met Sellar. He went into advertising and became advertising manager for [[Kodak]] Ltd.

When asked to convert his BA from Oxford into an MA, Yeatman could not find the fee owing to debt, and hence he is recorded in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;1066 and All That&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as &amp;quot;Failed MA, etc., Oxon&amp;quot;.

With Sellar he also wrote:
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;And now all this&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (sequel to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;1066 and All That&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Horse Nonsense&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1933 )ISBN 0-413-73990-2
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Garden rubbish and other country bumps&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
