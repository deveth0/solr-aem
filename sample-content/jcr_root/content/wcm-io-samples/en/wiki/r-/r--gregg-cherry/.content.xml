&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Robert Gregg Cherry&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (October 17, 1891{{spaced ndash}}June 25, 1957) was the [[List of Governors of North Carolina|61st]] [[Governor of North Carolina|Governor]] of the state of [[North Carolina]] from 1945 to 1949.

==Biography==
Born in [[South Carolina]] near Rock Hill, Cherry grew up in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]] with relatives after the death of his parents. He earned bachelor&amp;apos;s and law degrees at Trinity College (now [[Duke University]]). He organized and led a volunteer artillery company during [[World War I]].

Cherry served as [[mayor]] of Gastonia, as a member and speaker of the [[North Carolina House of Representatives]], as chairman of the [[North Carolina Democratic Party]] (1937â€“1940), and as a member of the [[North Carolina Senate]]. In Gastonia, it was joked that he was the best lawyer in town when sober, and the second-best lawyer in town when drunk.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=7k4L4hCzxWkC&amp;amp;pg=PA150&amp;amp;lpg=PA150&amp;amp;dq=%22gregg+cherry%22&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ots=avAV1AQYg2&amp;amp;sig=SFLdnIvs7uMzkJ8EscRq6xDKAaM&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;resnum=8&amp;amp;ct=result Tar Heel Laughter By Richard Walser]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1944, Cherry was elected [[List of Governors of North Carolina|governor]] as the last in a series of governors affiliated with the political machine of former Gov. [[O. Max Gardner]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Christensen, Rob. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Paradox of Tar Heel Politics&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. 2008. UNC Press.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Gov. Cherry inherited an economy facing material and labor shortages as a result of the ongoing [[Second World War]]. One of his primary focuses during his term was the improvement of mental health care at state-run facilities. [[Cherry Hospital]] in [[Goldsboro, North Carolina]], is named for him.

Unlike other Southern Democratic governors, Cherry supported [[Harry S. Truman]] for re-election in [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948]]. Cherry retired from politics and returned to the practice of law after his one term as governor (the maximum then allowed by the state constitution).
