&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;R. Swinburne Clymer M.D., D.O.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (November 25, 1878 - June 3, 1966) was an  American [[Rosicrucian]].  He succeeded Edward H. Brown as Supreme Grand Master of [[Fraternitas Rosae Crucis]] in 1922, and served until his death, when he was succeeded by his son Emerson Myron Clymer. He had reached the rank of Grand Master in 1905.

The succession from Edward H Brown &amp;apos;Eulis&amp;apos; to Clymer is questioned by many.  Clymer&amp;apos;s claim rested instead on having bought Randolph&amp;apos;s archive from Randolph&amp;apos;s widow, and he created his &amp;apos;Fraternitas Rosae Crucis&amp;apos; in 1920, two years before Brown died. (Source: Fr Melchior &amp;apos;Manifestations of the Neo-Rosicrucian Current&amp;apos;)

There are claims (unattributed, but possibly by Deveney ? ) that Clymer only attained the second degree in Eulis&amp;apos;s Temple of the Rosy Cross, in Boston.

What is not disputed is that Eulis was the holder of Randolph&amp;apos;s lineage and that he recognised the Societas Rosicruciana in America.  The concordance is on the SRIAmerica website. [http://www.sria.org/eulissociety.htm] It is not clear whether the  FRC can furnish a similar recognition.

Influenced by the writings of the 19th century [[occultist]] and [[sex magic]] practitioner, [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]], he kept several of Randolph&amp;apos;s books in print (sometimes in heavily edited form) through the middle of the 20th century,

A co-founder of [[FUDOFSI]], which recognized the Fraternitas as the authentic [[Rosicrucian]] organization rather than [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis|AMORC]], he tried to rekindle the organization after the death of leader [[Constant Chevillon]] in [[World War II]]. After the war he regarded the FRC as the world, rather than American, headquarters of Rosicrucianism.

In Brazil and in some other South American countries, the FRC merged with branches of [[Arnoldo Krumm-Heller]]&amp;apos;s [[Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua]] (FRA) to the extent that the two became indistinguishable.

Many FRA groups became disenchanted with Krumm-Heller&amp;apos;s teachings, and the branches merged with the FRC no longer accepted the Law of [[Thelema]].
