        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eliakum Zunser&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eliakim Badchen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elikum Tsunzer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (October 28, 1836 â€“ September 22, 1913), was a [[Lithuania]]n [[Jew]]ish [[Yiddish]]-language poet, songwriter, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[badchen]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; who lived out the last part of his life in [[United States of America|U.S.]]. A 1905 article in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[New York Times]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; lauded him as &amp;quot;the father of Yiddish poetry&amp;quot;. About a quarter of his roughly 600 songs survive. He influenced and was influenced by [[Brody singer]] [[Velvel Zbarzher]], although it is not believed that they ever met.

Born in [[Vilna]], he grew up poor and first worked braiding [[lace]] in [[Kovno]], where he was first associated with the devout, moralistic [[Mussar movement|Musar movement]] of [[Rabbi]] [[Israel Salanter]], but later drawn to the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment, and adopted a more modern [[Orthodox Judaism]] that renounced superstition.

Forcibly conscripted into the [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] Army just before his twentieth birthday, he was soon released due to Czar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]&amp;apos;s revocation of the harsh conscription law. The plight of Jewish draftees, or &amp;quot;[[cantonist]]s&amp;quot; would be a major subject of his early poetry and songs.

[[Sol Liptzin]] describes Zunser&amp;apos;s songs as having &amp;quot;simple words and catchy tunes&amp;quot;, singing of the &amp;quot;melancholy fate and few joys of the inarticulate masses&amp;quot; and writes that &amp;quot;His songs spread by word of mouth... until all Yiddish-speaking Jews were familiar with them&amp;quot;. [Liptzin, 1972, 48]

In 1861 he published a booklet of songs &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shirim Khadoshim&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the first of about 50 publications in his lifetime. At this time, he was, in Liptzin&amp;apos;s words, &amp;quot;primarily a Maskil&amp;quot;&amp;amp;mdash;a propagator of the Haskalah&amp;amp;mdash;&amp;quot;interested in instructing and aiding his people&amp;quot;. However, his life took a tragic turn: not only did his wife die of cholera in the next decade, but all of their nine children as well, and he became, again quoting Liptzin, &amp;quot;a prophet of doom, admonishing his co-religionists not to venture too date along the alluring road of western enlightenment and assimilation...&amp;quot; [Liptzin, 1972, 49] When that doom came, in the form of the [[anti-Semitic]] reaction and [[pogrom]] after the assassination of Alexander II, he became again a comforter, as well as a [[Zionism|Zionist]], affiliated with the [[Hovevei Zion]] and [[Bilu]] pioneers, writing songs such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;Die Sokhe&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;The Plough&amp;quot;) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;Shivath Zion&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Homecoming to Zion&amp;quot;).

Zunser emigrated to [[New York City]] in 1889, and worked as a printer.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Hutchins Hapgood|Hapgood, Hutchins]], [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL23369674M/The_spirit_of_the_Ghetto &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Spirit of the Ghetto: Studies of the Jewish Quarter in New York&amp;apos;&amp;apos;], 1902 - chapter 4&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; However, life in New York was not conducive to his muse, and he wrote little in the years after his arrival in America, mostly poems rather than songs. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;En route&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to the New World, he wrote the hopeful &amp;quot;Columbus and Washington&amp;quot;; once there, he followed this with the far more disillusioned &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;Dos Goldene Land&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;The Golden Land&amp;quot;) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;Der Greener&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;The Greenhorn&amp;quot;). His Zionism continued in a song urging the Jewish people to give up peddling and become farmers.

Zunser was saved from penury in his final years by a benefit performance on his behalf held at [[Cooper Union]], March 30, 1905, which raised enough money to give him a pension.

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;quot;He was far from a singer. His voice was not musical. But the sad tone one heard within it, the beautiful Yiddish, the soulful melodies - these were matchless.&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Ale Verk&amp;quot;, Band I, p. 18)&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
