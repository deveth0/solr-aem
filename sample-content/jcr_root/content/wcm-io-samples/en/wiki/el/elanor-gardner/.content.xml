&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elanor Gardner&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elanor the Fair&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a fictional character in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]&amp;apos;s fictional [[Middle-earth]] [[legendarium]]. She is the first child of [[Samwise Gamgee]] and his wife [[Rose Cotton (Hobbit)|Rose Cotton]].

She was born March 25, [[Shire Calendar|S.R.]] 1421 (which would be [[Third Age|T.A.]] 3021), the first day of the [[Fourth Age]] in [[Gondor]]. Elanor was the only one of Samwise&amp;apos;s children known to the [[Ring-bearer]], [[Frodo Baggins]], and her name was a suggestion by him, a reference to the [[Elanor|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;sun-star&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], a little golden flower blooming in the land of [[Lothlórien]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{ME-ref|RotK|&amp;quot;The Grey Havens&amp;quot;}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This perfectly satisfied Sam&amp;apos;s desire for a name that was both elvish and yet at the same time a simple flower-name as many hobbit-lasses had. The name was quite suitable, as Elanor had a notably [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elvish]] appearance, including golden hair—an extremely rare trait among hobbits. Her great beauty was renowned and earned her the title &amp;apos;the Fair.&amp;apos;

In 1436 Elanor became a [[maid of honour]] to Queen [[Arwen Evenstar]], and in 1451 she married Fastred of Greenholm. Four years later Fastred was named Warden of [[Westmarch]] by the [[Thain]] at the request of Samwise. Elanor and her husband then moved to the Undertowers on the [[Tower Hills]] where their family (becoming known as the Fairbairns of the Towers) would live for many generations.

After her father&amp;apos;s passing to the [[Undying Lands]] in 1482, Elanor and her line became the keepers of the [[Red Book of Westmarch]]. Her two children were Elfstan, born in 1454, and Fíriel.

Besides her presence as an infant in the last chapter of the published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and the details noted in the appendices of that book, Elanor&amp;apos;s most significant role was in the two versions of the written but unpublished epilogue of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, later published in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The History of Middle-earth]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; volumes. In that epilogue we see Elanor talk with her father about the importance of the events that transpired in the story and also about the coming of King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] and Queen [[Arwen]] for a visit. Elanor&amp;apos;s affectionate name for her father is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sam-dad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, while Sam calls her &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elanorellë&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In [[Peter Jackson]]&amp;apos;s [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|Lord of the Rings movie trilogy]], a six-year old Elanor was played by [[Alexandra Astin]], real-life daughter of [[Sean Astin]], the actor who played Samwise.
