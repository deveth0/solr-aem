        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elijah Fenton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (20 May 1683 â€“ 16 July 1730)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204324/Elijah-Fenton Britannica Online]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was an English poet, biographer and translator.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Fenton, Elijah}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Life==

Born in [[Shelton, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire|Shelton]] (now [[Stoke-on-Trent]]), and educated at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Venn|FNTN700E}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; for a time he acted as secretary to the [[Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery]] in Flanders, and was then Master of [[Sevenoaks Grammar School]].

In 1707, Fenton published a book of poems. He later became tutor to Sir [[William Trumbull]]&amp;apos;s son at [[Easthampstead Park]] in [[Berkshire]] and is now best known as the assistant of his neighbour, [[Alexander Pope]], in [[English translations of Homer#Fenton|his translation]] of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Odyssey]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of which he &amp;apos;Englished&amp;apos; the first, fourth, nineteenth, and twentieth books, catching the manner of his master so completely that it is hardly possible to distinguish between their work; while thus engaged he published (1723) a successful tragedy, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Marianne]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. His later contributions to literature were a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Life&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of [[John Milton]], and as an editor of [[Edmund Waller]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Poems&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1729).

He died on 16th of July 1730, and is buried in the churchyard of Stoke Parish Church, Stoke-on-Trent.

There is a memorial to him on the wall of [[St Michael and St Mary Magdalene&amp;apos;s Church, Easthampstead]], with an epitaph by [[Alexander Pope]]. This reads:-
&amp;lt;poem&amp;gt;
To the memory of Elijah Fenton of Shelton in Staffordshire,
who dyed at Easthampstead Anno 1730, aged forty seven years.
In honour of his great integrity &amp;amp; Learning.
William Trumbell Esq erected this monument.

This modest stone what few vain marbles can
May truly say, here lies an honest man
A poet blest beyond the poets fate
Whom heav&amp;apos;n left sacred from the proud and great
Foe to loud praise and friend to learned ease
Content with science in the vale of peace
Calmly he look&amp;apos;d on either life &amp;amp; here
Saw nothing to regret, or there to fear
From natur&amp;apos;s temp&amp;apos;rate feast rose satisfy&amp;apos;d
Thank&amp;apos;d heav&amp;apos;n that he had liv&amp;apos;d and that he dy&amp;apos;d.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;A. POPE&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
&amp;lt;/poem&amp;gt;
