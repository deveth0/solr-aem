&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elizabeth Blodgett Hall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was raised in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]] at a time when upper-class people fled there in order to avoid the economic pressures of the [[Great Depression]].

As a young girl she met the woman who would become Mrs. Emily Rose, wife of Milt Rose of the law firm [[Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander &amp;amp; Ferdon|Mudge, Rose, Guthrie &amp;amp; Alexander]], a firm which would later boast such partners as [[Richard M. Nixon]], future Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]] as well as [[Pat Buchanan]] who served as Nixon&amp;apos;s assistant.

In 1930, she married [[Livingston Hall]], a [[Harvard Law School]] professor. After she had children, she began studies at [[Radcliffe College]].

From 1949 to 1963 she was headmistress for [[Concord Academy]], an independent college preparatory school in [[Concord, Massachusetts]].  During her time there, Mrs. Hall was responsible for developing Concord Academy into a demanding college preparatory school.

In 1964, Elizabeth Blodgett Hall and her mother, Margaret Kendrick Blodgett, founded [[Bard College at Simon&amp;apos;s Rock|Simon&amp;apos;s Rock]], an early college designed specifically to accept students coming from their sophomore or junior years of high-school and usually before receiving high school diplomas. Simon&amp;apos;s Rock first class entered in 1966.

Mrs. Hall died July 18, 2005, at the age of 95 in [[Canaan, Connecticut]].
