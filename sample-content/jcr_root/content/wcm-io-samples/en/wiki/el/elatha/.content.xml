In [[Irish mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elatha&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elathan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (modern spelling: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ealadha&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was a prince of the [[Fomorians]] and the father of [[Bres]] by [[Ériu|Eri]] of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]]. The imagery surrounding him (he visits [[Ériu]] at night by sea on a silver boat) suggests he may once have been a [[moon god]].

==Overview==

Elatha is quoted as being the &amp;quot;The beautiful Miltonic prince of darkness with golden hair&amp;quot;.  He was the son of [[Dalbaech]] and a king of the [[Fomorians|Fomor]], he was father of [[Bres]] by [[Ériu|Eri]], a woman of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]]. He came to her over the sea in a vessel of silver, himself having the appearance of a young man with yellow hair, wearing clothes of gold and five gold [[torc|torcs]].  He was one of the [[Formorians|Fomor]] who took part in the [[Cath Maige Tuired|Second Battle of Magh Tuireadh]].

During the [[Cath Maige Tuired|Second Battle of Magh Tuireadh]], Elatha, son of [[Dalbaech]], watched over [[Dagda]]&amp;apos;s magic harp, [[Uaithne]], sometimes called Dur-da-Bla, &amp;quot;the Oak of Two Blossoms,&amp;quot; and sometimes Coir-cethar-chuin, &amp;quot;the Four-Angled Music.&amp;quot; He is said to have a sense of humor and a sense of nobility.

Though considered to be the [[Fomorian]] father of [[Bres|Eochu Bres]], Elatha (Elada) was also the father of the [[Dagda]], [[Ogma]], a son named [[Delbaeth]], and [[Elloth]] (the father of [[Manannan mac Lir]]) according to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  The mother of these [[Tuatha De Danann]] chiefs may have been [[Ethne]], the mother of [[Lugh|Lug]], based on [[Ogma|Ogma&amp;apos;]] often cited matronymic &amp;quot;mac Ethliu.&amp;quot;  Since [[Ethne]] was [[Fomorian]], this means they are all [[Fomorians]].  This is rather confusing, but may betray the battle between the two groups as actually being about the new generation of gods displacing the older generation.

==Elatha and Bres==

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;She told him that his father was Elatha, one of the Kings of the Fomorians; that he had come to her one time over a level sea in a great vessel that seemed to be of silver; that he himself had the appearance of a young man with yellow hair, his clothes decked with gold and five rings of gold around his neck. She had refused the love of all the young men of her own people, had given him her love and cried when he had left her.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{Citation Needed|date=June 2013}}

Before he left he had given her a ring from his own hand and had bade her give it only to the man whose finger it would fit. [[Ériu|Eri]] brought out the ring and put it on the finger of [[Bres]] and it fit him well. She and [[Bres]] and some of their followers then set out of the land of the [[Fomorians]]. At long last they came to that faraway land. Elatha the local King saw the ring on [[Bres|Bres’]] hand and asked him the whole story and said that [[Bres]] was his own son. Elatha then asked [[Bres]] what it was that drove him out of his own country and his own kingship. [[Bres]] answered truthfully: “Nothing drove me out but my own injustice and my own hardness; I took away their treasures from the people and their jewels and their food itself. And there were never taxes put on them before I was their King. And still I am come to look for fighting men that I may take Ireland by force”. Elatha listened and then bade him go to the chief King of the [[Fomorians]], [[Balor|Balar of the Evil Eye]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Names==

These are the names that Elatha has gone by and where that name stems from.

* Elathan represents an incorrect usage by [[Charles Squire|Squire]] and [[Lady Gregory]] as Elathan is the genitive case of Elatha and means &amp;apos;of Elatha&amp;apos;.
