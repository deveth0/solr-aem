        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eleanor Ruth Clitheroe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]], [[Master of Laws|LL.M]], [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B]], [[Master of Divinity|M.Div]] (born January 29, 1954) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] cleric and former businesswoman. She was  president and [[CEO]] of [[Hydro One]], the intended private successor to [[Ontario Hydro]].
&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torys_LLP&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Born in [[Montreal]], Clitheroe earned her [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B]] from the [[University of Western Ontario]] (UWO) in 1977. In 1978 she earned her [[Master of Laws|LL.M]] from [[McGill University]], and earned her [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from UWO in 1980. In 2005, she obtained a [[Master of Divinity]], from [[Wycliffe College]]. She is a candidate for a PHD Theology at University of Toronto.

She articled at the Tory, Tory DesLauriers &amp;amp; Binnington law firm in [[Toronto]], and worked for the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]]. She was [[Ontario]]&amp;apos;s deputy minister of finance under the New Democratic Party of Bob Rae from 1990 to 1993. She was then appointed a vice-president of [[Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario|Ontario Hydro]], and was appointed president and CEO when its name was changed to [[Hydro One]]. In 2000, she became chancellor of University of Western Ontario.

From 2000 until 2004 she was chancellor of the University of Western Ontario. In 2005, she was ordained a deacon in the Anglican Church of Canada, and later that year, was priested. She is executive director of Prison Fellowship Canada,and Padre to the Governor General Horse Guards.[9] She is pastor at St. Lukes, Smithville and was awarded The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Medal for her work in Justice.


In 2002 she was named Business Woman of the Year by the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[National Post]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  As the dust settled around Ontario Hydro&amp;apos;s corporate meltdown, some reflection on the complex politics and management at the hands of changing policies and governments&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.canadafreepress.com/2002/ed72902.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; has been used to temper the vilification of politically appointed executives. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.canadianbusiness.com/article/16618--an-apology-for-eleanor-clitheroe&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Clitheroe filed a lawsuit against the utility for increased severance and pension compensation after legislation was passed by the Conservative government cancelling pension.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.torontosun.com/comment/columnists/connie_woodcock/2010/06/11/14359881.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  This lawsuit was dismissed by the Ontario Superior Court on June 26, 2009 saying, &amp;quot;In short, the Legislature within its jurisdiction can do everything that is not naturally impossible,and is restrained by no rule human or divine...prohibition &amp;quot;Thou shalt not steal,&amp;quot; has no legal force upon the sovereign body and there would be no necessity for compensation to be given. Her further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed with costs in 2010.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-rejects-former-hydro-one-ceo-clitheroes-bid-for-464000-pension/article1320991/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
