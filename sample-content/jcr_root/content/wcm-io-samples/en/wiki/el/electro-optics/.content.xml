&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Electro-optics&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a branch of [[technology]] involving components, devices and systems which operate by modification of the optical properties of a material by an [[electric field]]. Thus it concerns the interaction between the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] ([[optics|optical]]) and the [[electricity|electrical]] ([[electron]]ic) states of materials.

== Electro-optical devices ==
The [[electro-optic effect]] relates to a change in the optical properties of the medium which usually is a change in the [[birefringence]] and not simply the refractive index.
In a [[Kerr cell]], the change in birefringence is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the square of the [[electric field]], and the material is usually a liquid.  In a [[Pockels cell]], the  change in birefringence varies linearly with the electric field, and the material is a crystal.
Non-crystalline electro-optic material have caught interested because of their low cost of production. It is polymer-based material, therefore is organic material. It is called sometimes as organic EO material, plastic EO material, or polymer EO material, which consists of a polymer and a nonlinear optical chromophore. Nonlinear optical chromophore is the molecule has Pockel&amp;apos;s effect.
