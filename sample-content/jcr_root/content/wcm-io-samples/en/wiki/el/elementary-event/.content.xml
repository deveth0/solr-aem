{{Probability fundamentals}}
In [[probability theory]], an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;elementary event&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also called an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;atomic event&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;simple event&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is an [[event (probability theory)|event]] which contains only a single outcome in the [[sample space]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book

  }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Using [[set theory]] terminology, an elementary event is a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]. Elementary events and the corresponding outcome are often written interchangeably for simplicity, as such an event corresponds to precisely one outcome.

The following are examples of elementary events:
* All sets {&amp;apos;&amp;apos;k&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}, where &amp;apos;&amp;apos;k&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;amp;nbsp;∈&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;N&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; if objects are being counted and the sample space is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;S&amp;apos;&amp;apos; = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} (the [[natural numbers]]).
* {HH}, {HT}, {TH} and {TT} if a coin is tossed twice. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;S&amp;apos;&amp;apos; = {HH, HT, TH, TT}. H stands for heads and T for tails.
* All sets {&amp;apos;&amp;apos;x&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}, where &amp;apos;&amp;apos;x&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a  [[real number]]. Here &amp;apos;&amp;apos;X&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[random variable]] with a [[normal distribution]] and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;S&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;amp;nbsp;=&amp;amp;nbsp;(&amp;amp;minus;∞,&amp;amp;nbsp;+∞).  This example shows that, because the probability of each elementary event is zero, the probabilities assigned to elementary events do not determine a continuous [[probability distribution]].

Elementary events may have probabilities that are strictly positive, zero, undefined, or any combination thereof.  For instance, any [[discrete random variable|discrete]] probability distribution whose sample space is finite is determined by the [[Probability|probabilities]] it assigns to elementary events.  In contrast, all elementary events have probability zero under any [[continuous random variable|continuous]] distribution.  Mixed distributions, being neither entirely continuous nor entirely discrete, may contain &amp;apos;&amp;apos;atoms&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Atoms can be thought of as elementary (that is, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;atomic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) events with non-zero probabilities.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book

 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Under the [[measure theory|measure-theoretic]] definition of a [[probability space]], the probability of an elementary event need not even be defined. In particular the set of events on which probability is defined may be some [[sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]] on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;S&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and not necessarily the full [[power set]].
