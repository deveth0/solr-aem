There are three types of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;elections in Denmark&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:  elections to the national parliament (the [[Folketing]]), local elections and elections to the [[European Parliament]]. [[Referendum]]s may also be called to consult the Danish citizenry directly on an issue of national concern.

Parliamentary elections are called by the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Monarch]] on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]], usually four years after the last election, although early elections may occur. Elections to local councils (municipal or regional) and to the European Parliament are held on fixed dates. Elections use the [[party-list proportional representation]] system. Only citizens on the [[Det Centrale Personregister|national register]] are eligible to vote in parliamentary elections and long-time residents may vote in local elections.

The last election was the [[Danish parliamentary election, 2011|parliamentary election]], on 15 September 2011.

==Parliamentary elections==
The Kingdom of Denmark (including the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]]) elects a [[unicameral]] parliament, the [[Folketing]], on a national level. Of the 179 members of parliament, the Faroe Islands and Greenland elect two members each, 135 are elected from ten multi-member constituencies on a [[Party-list proportional representation|party list PR]] system using the [[d&amp;apos;Hondt method]] and the remaining 40 seats are allocated to ensure proportionality at a national level. To get a share of supplementary seats a party needs to get at least 2% of the total number of votes.

Denmark has a [[multi-party]] system, with numerous [[political parties|parties]] in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and [[political parties|parties]] must work with each other to form [[coalition government]]s and/or [[minority cabinet]]s.

Elections to the Folketing must be held at least every four years.

==European elections==
The [[Denmark (European Parliament constituency)|Denmark constituency]] directly elects thirteen members to the [[European Parliament]] every five years. The [[d&amp;apos;Hondt method]] of proportional representation is used. The last election was carried out in June 2009:
