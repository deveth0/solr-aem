&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elias Levy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aleph One&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), was the moderator of the [[full disclosure]] vulnerability mailing list [[Bugtraq]] from May 14, 1996, until he stepped down on October 15, 2001. He was the CTO and co-founder of the computer security company [[SecurityFocus]], which was acquired by [[Symantec]] on August 6, 2002. He is also known as the author of the article &amp;quot;Smashing The Stack For Fun and Profit&amp;quot;, published in 1996 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Phrack]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; magazine issue 49, which was the first high-quality, public, step-by-step introduction to [[stack buffer overflow]] vulnerabilities and their exploitation.

After the sale of [[SecurityFocus]] to Symantec in August 2002, Levy was accused by many of &amp;quot;selling out&amp;quot; and compromising the high principles of the Bugtraq list. The &amp;quot;Full-Disclosure&amp;quot; mailing list was founded in part as a protest against the sale.
