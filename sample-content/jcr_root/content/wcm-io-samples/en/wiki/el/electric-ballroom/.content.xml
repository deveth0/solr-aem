The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Electric Ballroom&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a performance venue (primarily for [[rock and roll|rock]] bands) and indoor market located at 184 [[Camden High Street]] in [[Camden Town]], [[London]] ([[UK postcodes|postcode]] NW1 8QP).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;electricballroomwebsite&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web

The two-storey building has two dance floors and four bars. The ground floor has a stage and full concert facilities.

{{As of|2009}} on weekends the building has an indoor market with about fifty stalls selling a variety of fashion-, [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]- and [[music]]-related goods. The Friday club night is Sin City, playing rock, and alternative genres with occasional stage performances. The Friday club was formerly [[Goth subculture|goth]] night Full Tilt.  On Saturday, &amp;quot;Shake&amp;quot; plays mostly pop and dance from the 1970s, 1980s onwards, as well as modern hip hop and R&amp;apos;n&amp;apos;B. The Electric Ballroom was a roller disco for a brief period from the late 1970s to the early 1980s.

[[Transport for London]] proposed to demolish the Electric Ballroom in order to allow the redevelopment of the [[Camden Town tube station]], but the planning application for the redevelopment was rejected by [[Camden London Borough Council]] in 2004. A revised proposal from Transport for London in 2005 to demolish the whole block including the Ballroom, [[Buck Street Market]] and the [[Dr Martens]] store was rejected by Deputy Prime Minister [[John Prescott]]. In 2007 the government declared the Electric Ballroom a dilapidated building, a new argument which allows planning for the extension of the Camden Town tube station to be restarted. A public consultation ended on 22 February 2007. Details, the adoption statement and the adopted planning brief for the Camden Town Underground Station site are on the Camden Council website.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.camden.gov.uk/ccm/content/environment/planning-and-built-environment/planning-consultations/preparation-of-planning-brief-for-camden-town-underground-station-site-.en Camden Council adoption statement and adopted planning brief for the Camden Town Underground Station]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
