The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eleatics&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refers to the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] school of [[philosophy]] founded by [[Parmenides]] in the early fifth century&amp;amp;nbsp;BC in the ancient town of [[Velia|Elea]]. Other members of the school included [[Zeno of Elea]] and [[Melissus of Samos]]. [[Xenophanes]] is sometimes included in the list, though there is some dispute over this. Elea, whose modern-day appellation is Velia, was a [[Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|Greek colony]] located in present-day [[Campania]] in southern [[Italy]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=1911|publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=11|editor=Hugh Chrisholm}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==

The school took its name from Elea ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|l|i|ə}}; {{lang-el|Ἐλέα}}), a Greek city of lower Italy, the home of its chief exponents, Parmenides and Zeno. Its foundation is often attributed to [[Xenophanes]] of [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], but, although there is much in his speculations which formed part of the later Eleatic doctrine, it is probably more correct to regard Parmenides as the founder of the school.

Xenophanes espoused a belief that &amp;quot;God is one, supreme among gods and men, and not like mortals in body or in mind.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Zeller|title=Vorsokrastische Philosophie|page=530, n.3|language=German|trans_title=Pre-Socratic Philosophy}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Parmenides developed some of Xenophanes&amp;apos;s [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] ideas. Subsequently the school debated the possibility of [[motion (physics)|motion]] and other such fundamental questions. The work of the school was influential upon [[Plato]]nic metaphysics.

==Philosophy==

The Eleatics rejected the [[epistemology|epistemological]] validity of [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], and instead took logical standards of clarity and necessity to be the criteria of [[truth]]. Of the members, Parmenides and Melissus built arguments starting from indubitably sound premises. Zeno, on the other hand, primarily employed the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[reductio ad absurdum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, attempting to destroy the arguments of others by showing their premises led to contradictions (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Zeno&amp;apos;s paradoxes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

The main doctrines of the Eleatics were evolved in opposition to the theories of the early [[physicalism|physicalist]] philosophers, who explained all existence in terms of primary [[matter]], and to the theory of [[Heraclitus]], which declared that all existence may be summed up as perpetual change. The Eleatics maintained that the true explanation of things lies in the conception of a [[Henosis|universal unity]] of being. According to their doctrine, the [[senses]] cannot cognize this unity, because their reports are inconsistent; it is by thought alone that we can pass beyond the false appearances of sense and arrive at the [[knowledge]] of being, at the fundamental truth that the &amp;quot;All is One&amp;quot;. Furthermore, there can be no [[creation myth|creation]], for being cannot come from non-being, because a thing cannot arise from that which is different from it. They argued that errors on this point commonly arise from the ambiguous use of the verb to be, which may imply existence or be merely the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] which connects [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]].

Though the conclusions of the Eleatics were rejected by the later [[Presocratics]] and [[Aristotle]], their arguments were taken seriously, and they are generally credited with improving the standards of discourse and argument in their time. Their influence was likewise longlasting; [[Gorgias]], a [[Sophist]], argued in the style of the Eleatics in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;On Nature or What Is Not&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and [[Plato]] acknowledged them in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Furthermore, much of the later philosophy of the ancient period borrowed from the methods and principles of the Eleatics.
