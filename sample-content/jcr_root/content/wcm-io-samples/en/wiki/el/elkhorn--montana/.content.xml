&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elkhorn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small [[ghost town]] in [[Jefferson County, Montana|Jefferson County]], [[Montana]], [[United States]], in the [[Elkhorn Mountains]] of the southwestern part of the state.

==History==
Lodes of silver, described by geologists as [[Supergene (geology)|Supergene]] enrichments, were initially discovered in the Elkhorn mountains by Peter Wys, a Swiss immigrant.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghosttowngallery.com/htme/elkhorn.htm |title=Elkhorn, MT |accessdate=2010-12-01}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Six years later, Anton Holter, a pioneer capitalist from [[Helena, Montana]], began developing the mine. Over $14&amp;amp;nbsp;million in silver was carried from the mine. In 1890, the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] passed, creating a high demand for Elkhorn&amp;apos;s silver.

During this peak period, Elkhorn boasted 2,500 inhabitants, a school, hotel, church, stores, saloons, and brothels. Unlike most mining towns, Elkhorn was populated mostly by married European immigrants.&amp;lt;ref name=MTGhost&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://ghosttown.montana.com/elkhorn.html |title=The Montana Ghost Town Preservation Society-Elkhorn |accessdate=2010-12-01}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 1893 the Fraternity Hall was constructed for social gatherings, and still remains as one of the most well-preserved buildings in modern Elkhorn.

In the years following, the silver boom and Elkhorn&amp;apos;s prosperity began to lessen as the desire for silver decreased. A [[diphtheria]] epidemic also struck Elkhorn in the winter of 1888-1889, resulting in many deaths, particularly of children.&amp;lt;ref name=MTGhost/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web

}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Soon after, railroad service to Elkhorn was halted and only a fraction of the original inhabitants remained.

==Geography==
It can only be reached through its neighboring town, [[Boulder, Montana]] by taking the I-15 at Boulder exit, continuing {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} south on Montana 69, then {{convert|11|mi|km|0}} north on county graveled road.

==Demographics==
While very few standing buildings remain of the original Elkhorn, a number of cabins have been reoccupied and refurbished.
