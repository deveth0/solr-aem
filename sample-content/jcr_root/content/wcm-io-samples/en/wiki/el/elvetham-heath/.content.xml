&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elvetham Heath&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a residential area and [[civil parish]], containing 1,868 residences,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} on a {{convert|311|acre|km2sing=on}} site, just outside the north western boundary of the [[town]] of [[Fleet, Hampshire|Fleet]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Hampshire]].

==Location==
Elvetham Heath was built on reclaimed pine plantation/heathland between the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3 motorway]] and the [[London]]-[[Southampton]] railway line, {{convert|2|mi|km}} north of Fleet town centre. Formerly known as Railroad Heath, it previously belonged to the local Calthorpe Estate. Construction finished on the development in June 2008.

Elvetham Heath serves as a commuter area to local towns; [[Basingstoke]] some {{convert|12|mi|km}} to the west, [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] is {{convert|16|mi|km}} to the north and London is {{convert|37|mi|km}} to the northeast. The development is located precisely midway between [[Southampton]] and [[London]]. It is adjacent to the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3 motorway]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} from the [[M4 motorway|M4]], and {{convert|14|mi|km}} from the [[M25 motorway|M25]]. [[Fleet railway station]] is approximately {{convert|1.2|mi|km}} from the centre of the development.

==Attractions==
The new district has a pond, [[primary school]], [[day nursery]], [[community centre]], [[Church (building)|church]], [[public house]] and [[supermarket]]. About {{convert|20|acre}} of the heath was retained and is described as a nature reserve. The nature reserve is managed by [[Hart District Council]], with the intent to move it back to typical heathland, with some marsh areas. The area supports species including [[slow-worm]]s, lizards, and [[dragonfly|dragonflies]]. Rare breed cattle graze in the nature reserve during the summer and autumn.
