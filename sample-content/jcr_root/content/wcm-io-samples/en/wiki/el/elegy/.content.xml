:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Not to be confused with [[eulogy]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

In literature, an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;elegy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (from the Greek word for &amp;quot;[[lament]]&amp;quot;) is a mournful, melancholic or plaintive [[Poetry#Elegy|poem]], especially a [[funeral]] song or a [[lament]] for the dead.

==History==
The [[ancient Greek literature|Greek]] term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;elegeia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ἐλεγεία) originally referred to any verse written in [[elegiac couplet]]s and covering a wide range of subject matter (death, love, war). The term also included [[epitaph]]s and commemorative verses.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;penguin&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|last1=Cuddon|first1=J. A.|last2=Preston|first2=C. E.|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory|edition=4|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=9780140513639|pages=253–55}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The [[Latin]] elegy of [[Latin literature|ancient Roman literature]] was most often erotic or mythological in nature. Because of its structural potential for rhetorical effects, the elegiac couplet was also used by both Greek and Roman poets for witty, humorous, and satiric subject matter.

Other than epitaphs, examples of ancient elegy as a poem of mourning include [[Catullus]]&amp;apos; [[Catullus 101|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Carmen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 101]], on his dead brother, and elegies by [[Propertius]] on his dead mistress Cynthia and a matriarch of the prominent [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelian family]]. [[Ovid]] wrote elegies bemoaning his exile, which he likened to a death.

In English literature, the more modern and restricted meaning, of a lament for a departed beloved or tragic event, is only current since the sixteenth century; the broader concept was still employed by [[John Donne]] for his elegies, written in the early seventeenth century. For [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and others, the term had come to mean &amp;quot;serious meditative poem&amp;quot;,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;penguin&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; exemplified also by [[Thomas Gray]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1750).

&amp;quot;Elegy&amp;quot; (sometimes spelled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;elégie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) may denote a type of musical work, usually of a sad or somber nature.  A well-known example is the Élégie, Op. 10, by [[Jules Massenet]].  This was originally written for piano, as a student work; then he set it as a song; and finally it appeared as the &amp;quot;Invocation&amp;quot;, for cello and orchestra, a section of his [[incidental music]] to [[Leconte de Lisle]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Les Érinnyes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
