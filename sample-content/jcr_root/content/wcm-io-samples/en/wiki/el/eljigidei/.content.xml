&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eljigidei&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Mongol]] commander in [[History of Iran|Persia]], fl. (1206–1251/2)

He supposedly commanded a strong contingent when Chingis Khan invaded [[Khwarizm]] in 1219–1223. Ogedei was close to Eljihidey. That&amp;apos;s why Eljigidei was given command over the Mongol forces in Persia, by the new khan [[Güyük]] in 1246, replacing [[Baiju]].  Supposedly possessed of [[Christian]] sympathies like the khan, Eljigidei was ordered to advance into [[Syria]], and planned an advance on [[Baghdad]].  This advance was, ideally, to be conducted in alliance with [[Louis IX of France]], in concert with the [[Seventh Crusade]].  However, Güyük&amp;apos;s sudden death made Eljigidei postpone operations until after the [[interregnum]].

After the election of [[Möngke]], however, Eljigidei&amp;apos;s children were implicated in an aborted conspiracy to declare the election invalid.  Though supposedly innocent, Eljigidei was arrested and put to death as well in 1251 or 1252.  Baiju was subsequently returned to command in Persia.
