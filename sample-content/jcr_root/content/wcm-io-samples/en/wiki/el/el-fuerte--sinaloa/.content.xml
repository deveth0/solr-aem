        text="&lt;p&gt;:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;El Fuerte&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the name of a Mexican city and municipality, and also a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Bolivia. This article is about the city; for the ruins, see [[El Fuerte de Samaipata]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;El Fuerte&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-es|el ˈfwerte}}) is a city and its surrounding municipality in the northwestern [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[States of Mexico|state]] of [[Sinaloa]]. The municipality reported 100,000 inhabitants in the 2000 census, with 30,000 in the city.

El Fuerte, meaning &amp;quot;The Fort&amp;quot;, was named a &amp;quot;Pueblo Mágico&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Magic Town&amp;quot;) in 2009 (by whom?) for it has many attractions and a special, pretty-small-town Aura.

==History==

The city was founded in 1563 by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]] Francisco de Ibarra, the first explorer of the lofty  [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] mountains. In 1610 a fort was built to ward off the fierce Zuaque and Tehueco [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], who constantly harassed the Spaniards. For years, El Fuerte served as the gateway to the vast frontiers of the northern territories of [[Sonora]], [[Arizona]] and [[California]], all of which were sparsely populated by unyielding tribes of native amerindians.

For nearly three centuries it was the most important commercial and agricultural center of the vast northwestern region of Mexico. El Fuerte was a chief trading post for silver miners and gold seekers from the [[Urique]] and [[Batopilas]] mines in the nearby mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental and its branches.

In 1824, El Fuerte became the capital city of the newly created Mexican state of [[Sonora y Sinaloa]] (reaching up deep into modern-day Arizona). It remained the capital for several years until the split of this state into the states of [[Sinaloa]] and [[Sonora]].

== Tourism ==

Tourism remains a major industry in town, although it has been diminished in recent years by tourists being wary of [[Mexican drug cartel]] violence in other parts of [[Sinaloa]]; however, violence declined by 2013 from a high in 2011.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://isitsafetotraveltomexico.com/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  El Fuerte has several holidays and local &amp;quot;Fiestas&amp;quot; which are celebrated with pageants, &amp;quot;Ferias&amp;quot; and the like. Several hotels cater to hunters and fishermen, who hunt (deer, boar, wild hog, wild goat, rabbit, armadillo, a variety of snakes) in the foothills or fish in the nearby [[Rio Fuerte]] river which runs on the northwest part of the town&amp;apos;s commercial district. There are also local [[petroglyphs]] a short distance from the downtown.  The city also serves as a gateway to the popular [[Barranca de Cobre]] ([[Copper Canyon]]) situated in the nearby state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]].  There are no easily travelled roads to the [[Copper Canyon]] from west of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]].

==Transport==

===Passenger trains===
Visitors usually take the [[Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pacífico]] railway, whose local station is a few miles south of town. The route is on the [[Chihuahua al Pacífico|Chihuahua-Pacific]] Railroad, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ChePe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which passes through the scenic [[Copper Canyon]], from [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua]] to the northeast, to [[Los Mochis, Sinaloa]], near the [[Gulf of California]], to the southwest.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Mexlist, &amp;quot;PASSENGER TRAIN INFORMATION&amp;quot; http://www.mexlist.com/pass.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
