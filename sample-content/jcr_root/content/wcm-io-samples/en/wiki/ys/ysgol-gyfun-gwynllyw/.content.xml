&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{lang|cy|Ysgol Gyfun Gwynllyw}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (English: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;St Woolos&amp;apos; Comprehensive School&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[Welsh language|Welsh-medium]] [[comprehensive school]] located in [[Trevethin]], [[Pontypool]] in [[Torfaen]], [[Wales]] and named for [[Saint]] [[Gwynllyw]].

== History ==
The school was founded in 1988 as the first Welsh-medium school in the former [[Gwent (county)|Gwent LEA area]] and is housed in accommodation previously used for [[Trevethin Community School|Trevethin Comprehensive School]].

For its first three years Ysgol Gyfun Gwynllyw was housed in the old [[Abercarn]] [[Infant School]] house but soon outgrew the building.  As one of the fastest growing schools in Wales, bigger premises were needed and the old Trevethin upper school was suggested by the education authority.

Pupils at the school are taught completely in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and come from a range of Welsh-language feeder schools. The aim is to immerse pupils in Welsh and to enable them to be educated entirely in it as their native language.

An inspection report by [[Estyn]] in 2008 stated 94.5% of the pupils came from homes where English is the main language; 5.3% came from Welsh-speaking homes. The same report also says that all pupils speak Welsh as a first language or to an equivalent standard.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;2008 Estyn report in [http://www.estyn.gov.uk/download/publication/149494.8/inspection-reportysgol-gyfun-gwynllywcym2008/ Welsh] and [http://www.estyn.gov.uk/download/publication/149467.5/inspection-reportysgol-gyfun-gwynllyweng2008/ English]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 2009 the school was given a grant to make improvements and replace the old static cabins with a new complex.

A notable student from Ysgol Gyfun Gwynllyw is Lewis Robling, Newport Gwent Dragons Rugby Union Player.
