== Academic career ==

In 1961 Platonov graduated with highest distinction from Belarus State University. Two years later (in 1963) he received his Ph.D. from Academy of Sciences of Belarus. Platonov received his Doctor of Science degree from the Academy of Sciences of USSR in 1967. At the age of 28 Platonov received a title of full professor of the Belarus State University. This made him the youngest full professor in the history of Belarus.  Since 1972 he has been an Academician of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Belarus]] and its President (1987–1993).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ac.by/members/academicians/platonov.html|title=Academician Vladimir P. Platonov|publisher=Belarusian Academy of Sciences}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Academician of the Russian /USSR Academy of Sciences since 1987. He was the Director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of Belarus from 1977 to 1992.  His interests are [[algebra]], [[algebraic geometry]], and [[number theory]]. He solved
the Strong approximation problem, developed the reduced [[Algebraic K-theory|K-theory]] and solved the [[Tannaka–Artin problem]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;V. P. Platonov, &amp;quot;The Tanaka-Artin problem and reduced K-theory,&amp;quot; Izv. [[USSR Academy of Sciences|Akad. Nauk SSSR]],. Ser. Mat., 40:2, 1976, pp. 227–261 ({{ru icon}} [http://www.mathnet.ru/php/person.phtml?option_lang=rus&amp;amp;personid=9012 Проблема Таннака–Артина и приведенная $K$-теория])&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He solved also the Kneser-Tits and Grothendieck problems.Together with F.Grunewald he solved the arithmeticity problem for finite extensions of arithmetic groups and the rigidity problem for arithmetic subgroups of algebraic groups with radical.  Platonov solved also the rationality problem for spinor varieties and the Dieudonne problem on spinor norms.
Lenin Prize (1978), Humboldt Prize (1993).
Platonov was an invited speaker of the International Congresses of Mathematicians in Vancouver(1974), Helsinki(1978) and the European Congress of Mathematicians in Budapest(1996).

A celebrated figure in his native Belarus, he is also a member of the [[Canadian Mathematical Society]] and was from 1993 to 2001 a Professor of the [[University of Waterloo Faculty of Mathematics|Faculty of Mathematics]] of the [[University of Waterloo]] in [[Waterloo, Ontario]], [[Canada]].

He is the author, with [[Andrei Rapinchuk]], of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Algebraic Groups and Number Theory&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Vladimir Platonov, Andrei Rapinchuk, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Algebraic Groups and Number Theory&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Academic Press, 1993, ISBN 978-0-12-558180-6, {{ru icon}} [http://www.mathnet.ru/php/journal.phtml?wshow=paper&amp;amp;jrnid=rm&amp;amp;paperid=4493&amp;amp;year=1992&amp;amp;volume=47&amp;amp;issue=2&amp;amp;fpage=117&amp;amp;lpage=141&amp;amp;option_lang=rus Алгебраические группы и теория чисел], [[Uspekhi mathematicheskikh nauk|УМН]], 1992, No. 47:2(284), pp. 117–141&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He currently works as a Chief Science Officer of [[Scientific Research Institute of System Development]] (NIISI RAN).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.niisi.ru/platonov.htm Vladimir Platonov] at [[NIISI]] website&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Assault conviction ==
On November 9, 1999, Platonov was to appear in court on a bail hearing on a charge of [[attempted murder]] for an attack on his wife.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Prof charged with attempted murder|url=http://www.bulletin.uwaterloo.ca/1999/nov/09tu.html|newspaper=Waterloo Daily Bulletin |date=Nov 9, 1999}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was convicted of assaulting his wife.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca/news.php?id=2320|title=Statement on Prof. Vladimir Platonov|publisher=University of Waterloo Communications &amp;amp; Public Affairs}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The court gave him a conditional sentence of two years.
