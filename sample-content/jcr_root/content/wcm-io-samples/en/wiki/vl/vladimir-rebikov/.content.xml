&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vladimir Ivanovich Rebikov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Влади́мир Ива́нович Ре́биков, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vladi&amp;apos;mir Iva&amp;apos;novič Re&amp;apos;bikov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}; born May 31 [OS May 19]1866 - [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Siberia]], [[Russia]] — died October 1, 1920 - [[Yalta]], [[Crimea]], [[Ukraine]]) was a late [[romantic music|romantic]] 20th century [[Russia]]n composer and pianist.

==Biography==
Rebikov began studying the piano with his mother. His sisters also were pianists. He graduated from the [[Moscow University]] faculty of [[philology]]. He studied at the [[Moscow Conservatory]] with N. Klenovsky, a pupil of [[Peter Tchaikovsky]], and then for three years in Berlin and [[Vienna]] with K. Meyerberger ([[music theory]]), O. Yasch ([[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]]), and T. Muller (piano). Rebikov taught and played in concerts in various parts of the [[Russian Empire]]: Moscow, [[Odessa]], [[Kishinev]], [[Yalta]],  as well as in Berlin, [[Vienna]], [[Prague]], [[Leipzig]], [[Florence]] and Paris, where met [[Claude Debussy]], [[Oscar Nedbal]], [[Zdenek Needly]], and others. Rebikov settled in Yalta in 1909.

==Legacy==
Early works suggest the influence of [[Peter Tchaikovsky]]. He wrote lyrical piano miniatures (suites, cycles, and albums), children&amp;apos;s choruses and songs. One of his vocal cycles is called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Basni v litsach&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Fables in Faces&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) after [[Ivan Krylov]]. He wrote also a stage work &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Krylov&amp;apos;s Fables&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (c. 1900). His children&amp;apos;s music is the most notable of all his works.  He continued the Russian penchant for the [[whole tone scale]], using it in the piece &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Les demons s&amp;apos;amusent&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, included into the melomimic suite &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Les Rêves&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dreams&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1899).

He used new advanced harmony such as seventh and ninth chords, unresolved cadences, [[polytonality]], and harmony based upon open fourths and fifths. He also was experimenting with novel forms, for instance, in his piano pieces, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mélomimiques&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Op. 10 (1898), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rythmodéclamations&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in which music and mime are combined, and he introduced a type of musical pantomime known as &amp;quot;melo-mimic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;rhythm-declamation&amp;quot; (see [[melodeclamation]]). His orchestral and stage works include more than ten operas, such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yolka&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ёлка - The Christmas Tree&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), and two ballets.

==Quotations==
“Rebikov was already a forgotten figure by the time of his death at age 54. He was bitter and disillusioned, convinced wrongly that composers such as [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]], and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] had made their way into public prominence through stealing his ideas. Ironically Rebikov is best known by way of his insubstantial music in salon genres. Rebikov&amp;apos;s role as an important early instigator of twentieth-century techniques deserves to be more widely recognized.”  (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Uncle Dave Lewis, Allmusic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;V grozu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;В грозу — In the Storm, Op. 5, after [[Vladimir Korolenko]] 1863, premiered 1894, Odessa)

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dvoryanskoye Gnezdo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Дворянское Гнездо — A Nest of Nobles&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Op. 55, Op. 55 after [[Ivan Turgenev]], 1916)
