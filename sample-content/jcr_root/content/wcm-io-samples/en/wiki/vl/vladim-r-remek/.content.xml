Vladimír Remek was born in [[České Budějovice]] to Czech mother and Slovak father. His father, Jozef Remek, was [[Lieutenant General]] of the Czechoslovak army (1973-75 deputy of the Minister of Defense responsible for air force and air defense, 1976-89 commander of the air force). In 1970 Vladimír Remek became military pilot. In 1976 he finished a [[Gagarin Air Force Academy]] in Monino, Moscow Region.

Remek joined the [[Intercosmos]] program in 1976; his backup was [[Oldřich Pelčák]]. After the flight, on March 16, 1978, he and [[Aleksei Gubarev]], the other member of the crew, were awarded the title [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=1555 Biography] at the website on Heroes of the Soviet Union and Russia&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1990 he became director of the Military Museum for Aviation and Astronautics in [[Prague]], since 1995 he worked as a sales representative for the company [[Česká Zbrojovka Strakonice|ČZ]] in [[Moscow]], since 2002 he served at the Czech embassy in [[Russia]].

During the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Czech Republic)|2004 European Parliament election]] Remek was an independent candidate for the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia]] and, being second on the list, was elected into the European Parliament. He was elected again into the European Parliament in [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Czech Republic)|2009 European Parliament election]].
