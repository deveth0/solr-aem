&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Woodside Omega Transmitter&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (station G, now Woodside VLF transmitter) near [[Woodside, Victoria]], [[Australia]] uses an [[umbrella antenna]] carried by a {{convert|432|m}} high grounded lattice steel guyed mast. Unlike many of the other Omega Transmitters, Woodside is not a &amp;quot;hot tower,&amp;quot; that is, one which is insulated from a ground connection by large ceramic insulators that support the entire weight of the structure.  Rather, the tower is electrically insulated from the topmost guys which served as the radiators, similar to the metal radials of an umbrella without cloth covering.  The mast simply supports the downward sloping guy wires which are the active elements.  The guy wires also are used to hold the tower itself in place.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.haikuvalley.com/Other/Australia/21320329_kTMbrS#!i=1697884245&amp;amp;k=vzNpHJQ  Australia - HAIKU VALLEY]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This mast is the highest structure in the southern hemisphere.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[List of tallest structures in the world by country]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Construction of this station was originally planned to be built in [[New Zealand]] but after protests from anti-war protestors it was built in Australia.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://antipodeanmariner.blogspot.com.au/2012/01/omega-navigation-system.html  Antipodean Mariner - Omega Navigation System]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

After the shutdown of the [[OMEGA Navigation System|OMEGA navigation system]] it was used until 2004 as a transmitter for uni-directional communications to [[submarine]]s on 13&amp;amp;nbsp;kHz under the callsign VL3DEF.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2008/12/23/2453832.htm  Curtain draws on Cold War icon - ABC Gippsland Vic - Australian Broadcasting Corporation]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Until December 2008, it had been transmitting a 100 baud [[Minimum-shift keying|MSK]] modulated signal on 18.6&amp;amp;nbsp;kHz.

==Current Status==
The station was decommissioned in November 2008. [[Aircraft warning lights]] continue to operate on each of the 10 43m platforms, however some of these lights have since stopped working. Transmission equipment from the Omega navigation system is now on display at the [[Port Albert Maritime Museum]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://yarrampa.customer.netspace.net.au/pamm.html  Port Albert Maritime Museum]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.cv.vic.gov.au/organisations/3951/port-albert-maritime-museum/  Culture Victoria - Port Albert Maritime Museum]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
