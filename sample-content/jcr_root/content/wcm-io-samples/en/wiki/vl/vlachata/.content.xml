&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vlachata&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Βλαχάτα, also Βλαχάτα Εικοσιμίας) is a village and a community in the eastern part of the municipal unit of [[Leivathos]] near the south coast of the island of [[Kefalonia]], [[Greece]].  To avoid confusion with another Vlachata near Sami, it is also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vlachata Eikosimias&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The community consists of the villages Vlachata and Simotata, which is 2&amp;amp;nbsp;km east of Vlachata. Vlachata is situated on a mountain slope above the [[Ionian Sea]] coast, at about 200 m elevation. [[Mount Ainos]], the highest point of Cephalonia, is 4&amp;amp;nbsp;km to the northeast. Vlachata is 1&amp;amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Lourdata]], 2&amp;amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Mousata]], 13&amp;amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Poros, Cephalonia|Poros]] and 13&amp;amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Argostoli]]. The road from Argostoli to Poros runs through Vlachata. Vlachata suffered great damage from the [[1953 Ionian earthquake]].
