&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wheatley Place&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a neighborhood in [[south Dallas|south]] [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] ([[United States|USA]]) that is designated as a [[Dallas Landmark|Dallas Landmark District]] and [[National Register of Historic Places|National Historic District]]. by the city.  Included among the buildings that compose the historic district is the home of Dallas [[American civil rights movement|civil rights]] pioneer, [[Juanita Craft]].&amp;lt;!--Admittedly, this needs work.  I can&amp;apos;t find a list of buildings online anywhere... --&amp;gt;

Predominantly constructed as a neighborhood for [[African American]]s, the area was named for [[Phillis Wheatley]], an African American poet from the 18th century.

The [[Dallas City Council]] designated Wheatley Place as a Historic District on 25 October 2000.
