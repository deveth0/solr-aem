[[File:Baby wolphin by pinhole.jpeg|thumb|Kawili Kai, born to a female wholphin by a male dolphin, at 9 months of age in September 2005]]

A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;wholphin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;wolphin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an extremely rare [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] born from a mating of a female [[bottlenose dolphin]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tursiops truncatus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) with a male [[false killer whale]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pseudorca crassidens&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). The name implies a hybrid of whale and dolphin, although [[taxon]]omically, both are within the &amp;quot;[[oceanic dolphin]]&amp;quot; family, which is within the &amp;quot;[[toothed whale]]&amp;quot; suborder.&amp;lt;ref name=sean/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=msnbc&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7508288/ |title=Whale-dolphin hybrid has baby wholphin |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |accessdate=November 12, 2009 |date=April 15, 2005}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Although they have been reported to exist in the wild,&amp;lt;ref name=msnbc/&amp;gt; only one is currently in captivity, at [[Sea Life Park]] in [[Hawaii]].&amp;lt;ref name=sean&amp;gt;{{cite news |author=[[Sean B.

The wholphin&amp;apos;s size, color and shape are intermediate between the parent species. She has 66 teeth - intermediate between a bottlenose (88 teeth) and false killer whale (44 teeth) |work=[[New York Times]] |date=September 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 14, 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Kekaimalu, the first wholphin in captivity, proved fertile when she gave birth at a very young age.  The calf died after a few days. However, in 1991, Kekaimalu gave birth once again, to daughter Pohaikealoha. For two years, she cared for the calf, but did not nurse it; it was hand-reared by trainers. Pohaikealoha died at age 9. On December 23, 2004, Kekaimalu had her third calf, daughter Kawili Kai, sired by a male bottlenose. This calf did nurse and was very playful. Only months after birth, it was the size of a one-year-old bottlenose dolphin.&amp;lt;ref name=sean/&amp;gt;  Each calf was three-quarters dolphin and one-quarter whale.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|month=January-February|title=Ditching SUVs and Breeding Beefalos|journal=E Magazine|volume=17|issue=1|page=64|publisher=Earth Action Network|accessdate=May 4, 2013|url=http://www.questiaschool.com/read/1G1-141706612/ditching-suvs-and-breeding-beefalos {{subscription needed}}}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Both remain in captivity, and are now part of the normal tour at Sea Life Park.
