&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;When in Rome Do as the Vandals&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the first album by the [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]] [[punk rock]] band [[The Vandals]], released in 1984 by [[National Trust Records]]. Its title is a play on the phrase &amp;quot;[[wiktionary:when in Rome, do as the Romans do|When in Rome, do as the Romans do]]&amp;quot;, as the [[Vandal]]s was also the name of a Germanic tribe which had invaded the [[Roman Empire]] and helped lead to its destruction. The album&amp;apos;s cover played on this theme by showing the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] in a state of destruction. It was the band&amp;apos;s last recording with vocalist [[Steven Ronald Jensen|Stevo]], who left the band shortly after due to personality conflicts with some of the other members.

On the original LP release Brent Turner is credited as having performed all of the [[bass guitar|bass]] tracks, but by the time of its release Chalmer Lumary had joined the band on the [[bass guitar|bass]] position. Chalmer&amp;apos;s name and photo are therefore included on the album sleeve along with those of the other members. The album sleeve also lists the seventh track as being &amp;quot;It&amp;apos;s Not Unusual,&amp;quot; a cover of a song by [[Burt Bacharach]]. The label on the LP itself, however, correctly lists this track as being a cover of &amp;quot;Hocus Pocus&amp;quot; by the band [[Focus (band)|Focus]]. The sleeve also lists the album&amp;apos;s sixth track as being spelled &amp;quot;Viking Suite,&amp;quot; although the label again corrects this error by spelling it &amp;quot;Viking Suit&amp;quot; (as it is pronounced in the song&amp;apos;s lyrics).

The album was re-released in 1989 in [[CD]] format along with the band&amp;apos;s debut [[Extended play|EP]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Peace Thru Vandalism]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Peace Thru Vandalism/When in Rome Do as the Vandals]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The CD version was released by [[Restless Records]] (later reissued by [[Time Bomb Recordings]]) and correctly lists the song titles as described above.
