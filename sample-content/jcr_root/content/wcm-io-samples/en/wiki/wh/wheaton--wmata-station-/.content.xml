&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wheaton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Washington Metro]] [[metro station|station]] in [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], [[Maryland]] (USA) on the [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Red Line]].

The station serves the [[suburb]] of [[Wheaton, Maryland|Wheaton]], and is located at the intersection of [[Georgia Avenue]] ([[Maryland Route 97]]) and Reedie Drive. This station features [[Escalator#Longest_individual_escalators|the longest]] set of single-span [[escalator]]s in the [[Western Hemisphere]], each featuring a length of {{convert|230|ft|m}},&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/docs/metrofacts.pdf Metro Facts]. [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]]. Accessed September 14, 2010.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; with a vertical rise of {{convert|115|ft|m}}.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The Washington Post. &amp;quot;Standing on the Left? You Must Be on Vacation&amp;quot;, 5/17, 2004, Washington, D.C.: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31605-2004May16.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is the second deepest station in the system, behind [[Forest Glen (Washington Metro)|Forest Glen]], which has an elevator-only exit due to its depth. Wheaton&amp;apos;s escalators travel at a speed of {{convert|90|ft|m}} per minute (Â±5%) and are set at an inclination of 30 degrees.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Elevator/Escalator Department, WMATA. Reply to a costumer inquiry, Case 580424. Answer forwarded by Helen B. Gregory, Costumer Service, WMATA, 9/14, 2010&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The trip takes approximately 2 minutes and 45 seconds, though some commuters shorten the time by walking.

Another architectural feature of this station is separate tunnels and platforms for each direction, instead of the large, vaulted common room seen at most other underground stations in the Metro system.  This design, which is similar to many of the [[London Underground]]&amp;apos;s tube stations, was used to save money due to the station&amp;apos;s depth. [[Forest Glen (Washington Metro)|Forest Glen]] is the only other Washington Metro station to have this design.

Service at Wheaton began on {{#dateformat:September 22, 1990}}. It was the northeastern end of the Red Line for nearly eight years, until the [[Glenmont (Washington Metro)|Glenmont]] station opened in July 1998.
