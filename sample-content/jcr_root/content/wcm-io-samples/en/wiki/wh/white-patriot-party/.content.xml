The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;White Patriot Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;WPP&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was an [[United States|American]] [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]]  [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] [[paramilitary]] [[political party]] associated with [[Christian Identity]] and the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. It was led by its founder, [[Frazier Glenn Miller Jr.]], through various organizational incarnations. The organization began in the mid-1970s as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It was involved in the [[Greensboro massacre|incident]] in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] when a confrontation between Klansmen, Nazis and communists left five people dead. The organization became the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the early 1980s and the White Patriot Party in 1985.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Michael and Judy Ann Newton eds. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Ku Klux Klan; an encyclopedia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Garland Reference Library of the Social Science Vol.499 London and New York; Garland Publishing inc. 1991 pp.98, 395, 610&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

At a time of a poor farming economy in [[North Carolina]], the group built support by blaming economic problems on [[Jew]]ish bankers.  Estimates were that its numbers might have been as high as 3000. On April 6, 1987, the group [[Declaration of war|declared war]] against the federal government, which they called &amp;quot;[[Zionist Occupation Government]]&amp;quot; (ZOG).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070930013115/http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=127 &amp;quot;White Patriot Party (WPP)&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Terrorism Knowledge Base&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,  Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, retrieved on April 8th, 2010&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The WPP collapsed after Miller violated an injunction against [[paramilitary]] activity and was convicted of threatening the [[civil rights]] activist [[Morris Dees]].  He was imprisoned from 1987-1990.  In a 1988 [[sedition]] trial in Arkansas, Miller testified for the prosecution that he had received $200,000 in stolen money from [[The Order (group)|The Order]] to finance operations of the White Patriot Party.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Jackson&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=840 Camille Jackson, &amp;quot;They&amp;apos;re Back: A fresh batch of extremist ex-cons hits the streets&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Southern Poverty Law Center#Intelligence_Report|Intelligence Report]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (Winter 2004, Issue #116, Southern Poverty Law Center, retrieved April 8th, 2010&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The Order was also called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;BrÃ¼der Schweigen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Silent Brotherhood&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
