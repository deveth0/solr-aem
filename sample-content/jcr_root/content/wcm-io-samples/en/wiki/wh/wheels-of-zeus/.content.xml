&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wheels of Zeus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;WoZ&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was a company founded in 2001 by [[Apple Computer|Apple]] co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]].  WoZ made wireless hardware for keeping track of the physical location of enabled objects. The licensable technology consisted of three components:

# &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Smart Tag&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; A tag containing [[GPS]] that could be attached to various objects, such as a brief case or pet. &amp;quot;Acceptable areas&amp;quot; could be preprogrammed, such that the tag would signal the Tag Detector when it was moved outside them. The tag communicated over a wireless network was named &amp;quot;wOzNet&amp;quot; and leveraged GPS techniques to transmit the tag&amp;apos;s position over extreme distances with very little power.
# &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tag Detector&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; This was a handheld device that could monitor a collection of Smart Tags, and provide a distance and direction to help locate them when they were lost. It also communicated with the wOz Service when a Smart Tag was lost.
# &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;WoZ Service&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; An internet based service that could provide the locations of the various Smart Tags, as well as send an email or SMS notification when a Smart Tag moved outside of its &amp;quot;acceptable area&amp;quot;.

In March 2006, Wheels of Zeus shut down operations.  Key assets and patents have been acquired by ZonTrak.
