        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fernando Mezzasoma&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (August 3, 1907 &amp;amp;ndash; April 28, 1945) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Fascism|fascist]] journalist and political figure.

==Biography==
Mezzasoma was born in [[Rome]], the son of middle-class [[Perugia]]ns; from his late teens he showed himself to be a passionate supporter of [[Benito Mussolini]].

Mezzasoma had to contribute to his impovershed family&amp;apos;s income from early on, and took several jobs before finishing studies in [[accounting]]. A secretary to the lawyer [[Amedeo Fani]], he was integrated to the state [[bureaucracy]] in 1929, after Fani became undersecretary to the ministry of [[Dino Grandi]] (the [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]). In 1931, he joined the ranks of the [[National Fascist Party]] (PNF), and soon after became secretary of the Perugia branch of the [[Gruppo Universitario Fascista]] (GUF), the Fascist [[student organization]].

The following year, Mezzasoma was appointed one of the local PNF leaders in Perugia (holding the position until 1935). He began writing for official magazines, such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dottrina Fascista&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Roma Fascista&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, usually under the [[pen name]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogene]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Editor of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Assalto]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1934, he became co-editor of the GUF mouthpiece &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Libro e Moschetto]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; in 1937, he published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Essenza dei GUF&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Essence of the GUF&amp;quot;), a [[propaganda]] volume that was distributed throughout the network of Fascist [[youth organization]]s.

A national deputy-secretary of the GUF in 1935, he was included to the leadership group of the PNF in January 1937, and its deputy-secretary on February 23, 1939. When Italy entered [[World War II]] as an [[Axis Powers|Axis Power]], he volunteered for the 7th Artillery Division. In 1942, he quit the army to become the director of the Italian press; he continued in that role until 1943. Unlike a great many leading figures of the government (such as [[Galeazzo Ciano]] and [[Dino Grandi]]), he stayed loyal to Mussolini long after the July 1943 [[Grand Council of Fascism]] crisis which ended the latter&amp;apos;s rule in [[Rome]].

With the foundation of the [[Nazi Germany]]-assisted [[Italian Social Republic]], he was appointed Mussolini&amp;apos;s Minister of Popular Culture, and held this post until the Republic collapsed less than two years later.

He clashed with [[Junio Valerio Borghese]] and, on April 19, 1945, left for [[Milano]] - parting with his collaborators (including [[Giorgio Almirante]]). It seems that he had the opportunity to flee the region following Germany&amp;apos;s defeat, but would have refused, saying: &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;I am a minister of Mussolini, I shall die with him&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

He was shot by the [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]] in [[Dongo, Italy|Dongo]], captured while he was trying to make his way to [[Switzerland]].
