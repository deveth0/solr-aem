&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fearless Leader&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a fictional character and the principal antagonist in the 1959â€“1964 [[animated television series]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show|Rocky and His Friends]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show|The Bullwinkle Show]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, both shows often collectively referred to as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show|Rocky and Bullwinkle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He was voiced by [[Leon Askin]].

==Character overview==
Fearless Leader is the [[dictator]] of the [[fictional country]] [[Pottsylvania]], and the employer of the inept [[government agents]] [[Boris Badenov]] and [[Natasha Fatale]]. He could always be found in his underground hideout, &amp;quot;Central Control.&amp;quot; However, it seems evident that he did answer to one man himself: the diminutive [[Mister Big (Rocky and Bullwinkle)|Mr. Big]]. Mr. Big appears in two storylines of the series, &amp;quot;Upsidaisium&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Metal Munching Moon Mice.&amp;quot;

[[File:This Is The Enemy.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This is the Enemy&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Koehler/Ancona, 1942): possible basis for character appearance.]]As expected from his given position and name, Fearless Leader is a strict, ruthless character, and often harshly criticizes the incompetence of his main minion Boris. He is usually shown with a long scar on his cheek. He is distrustful of his own government employees, and is known to carry the Pottsylvania treasury with him wherever he goes. Although Pottsylvania&amp;apos;s chief spies are given [[ersatz]] [[Russian language|Russian]] accents, Fearless Leader&amp;apos;s accent seems more in keeping with the [[German people|German]] [[stereotype]]. In fact, his sharply-angled features closely resemble those from [http://web.archive.org/web/20110724155033/http://www.terraamericanart.org/dynamic/events/sb_events_image_1_1952.jpg an anti-Nazi propaganda poster] circulated during [[World War II]]. He uses some German such as &amp;quot;Achtung&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Schweinhund.&amp;quot;  Thus, it has also been conjectured{{by whom|date=September 2012}} that he was modeled after Nazi Major Strasser in the 1942 movie &amp;quot;[[Casablanca_(film)|Casablanca]]&amp;quot;.

==In other media==
* Fearless Leader appears in two live-action films: he is portrayed by [[Christopher Neame]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Boris and Natasha: The Movie]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1992) and by [[Robert De Niro]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2000).
* Fearless Leader was also the background picture seen hanging on the wall in the old newspaper cartoon, &amp;quot;[[Grin and Bear It]]&amp;quot; by Lichty, whenever the [[Kremlin]] or [[politburo]] was being lampooned.
* In [[Jamie Gilson]]&amp;apos;s book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;4B Goes Wild&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the strict, no-nonsense [[headmaster|headmistress]] of the elementary school is called that behind her back. When the [[protagonist]], Hobie Hanson, wins a lunch date with the headmistress in a [[raffle]], his friends tease him as to &amp;quot;When are you going to eat with Fearless Leader?&amp;quot;
