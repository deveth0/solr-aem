        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fern H. Shubert&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a  [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] member of the [[North Carolina General Assembly]] representing the state&amp;apos;s thirty-fifth [[North Carolina Senate|Senate]] district, including constituents in [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina|Mecklenburg]] and [[Union County, North Carolina|Union]] counties.  An accountant from [[Marshville, North Carolina]], Shubert served three terms in the state House before being elected to the Senate, where she was the Republican [[whip (politics)|whip]].

Before it folded, she wrote a column in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;County Edge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a weekly publication in Union County, and still weighs in on local political issues including a fight against a half-cent prepared food and beverage tax that would have helped build a civic center in Monroe.

Fern Shubert was one of the candidates for the Republican gubernatorial nomination to challenge Governor [[Mike Easley]] in the [[North Carolina gubernatorial election, 2004|2004 election]]. The sole [[woman]] in a field of six contenders for the GOP nomination, Shubert campaigned as an outsider to the party establishment, but placed fifth in the primary, gathering only 4% of votes cast.

Shubert ran to return to her old Senate seat in 2010.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/story/293382.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; She lost the Republican primary on May 4 to Tommy Tucker.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/NC/15705/24367/en/summary.html State Board of Elections - Primary Election Results]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 2012, Shubert filed to run for [[North Carolina State Auditor]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://ncfef.org/Images/2012_Election_Tracker.pdf 2012 Election Tracker]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
