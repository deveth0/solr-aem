        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Federal Meat Inspection Act&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of 1906 (FMIA) is a United States Congress Act that works to prevent adulterated or misbranded meat and meat products from being sold as food and to ensure that meat and meat products are slaughtered and processed under sanitary conditions. These requirements also apply to imported meat products, which must be inspected under equivalent foreign standards. USDA inspection of poultry was added by the [[Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957]]. The [[Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] authorizes the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to provide inspection services for all livestock and poultry species not listed in the FMIA or PPIA, including venison and buffalo. The [[Agricultural Marketing Act]] authorizes the USDA to offer voluntary, fee-for-service inspection services for these same species.

== Historical motivation for enactment ==
The original 1906 Act authorized the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] to inspect and condemn any meat product found unfit for human consumption. Unlike previous laws ordering meat inspections, which were enforced to assure European nations from banning pork trade, this law was strongly motivated to protect the American diet. All labels on any type of food had to be accurate (although not all ingredients were provided on the label). Even though all harmful food was banned, there were still few warnings provided on the container. The law was partly a response to the publication of [[Upton Sinclair]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Jungle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, an exposé of the [[Chicago]] [[meat packing industry]], as well as to other [[Progressive Era]] [[muckraker|muckraking]] publications of the day.

The book&amp;apos;s assertions were confirmed in the Neill-Reynolds report, commissioned by [[President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1906. Roosevelt was suspicious of Sinclair&amp;apos;s [[socialist]] attitude and conclusions in [[The Jungle|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Jungle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] and so sent labor commissioner [[Charles P. Neill]], and social worker James Bronson Reynolds, men whose honesty and reliability he trusted, to Chicago to make surprise visits to meat packing facilities.

Despite betrayal of the secret to the meat packers, who worked three shifts a day for three weeks to thwart the inspection, Neill and Reynolds were still revolted by the conditions at the factories and at the lack of concern by plant managers. Following their report, Roosevelt became a supporter of regulation of the meat packing industry.

==Provisions==
The FMIA mandated the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) inspection of meat processing plants that conducted business across state lines.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;34 Stat. 674 (amended by Pub. L. No. 59-242, 34 Stat. 1260 (1967)) (codified at 21 U.S.C. §§ 601 et seq.).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], enacted on the same day in 1906, also gave the government broad jurisdiction over food in [[interstate commerce]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Pub. L. No. 59-384, 34 Stat. 768 (1906), (codified at 21 U.S.C. §§ 1-15) (1934) (repealed in 1938 by 21 U.S.C. § 392(a)).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The four primary requirements of the Meat Inspection Act of 1906 were:

#Mandatory inspection of [[livestock]] before slaughter (cattle, [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[equine]]s, and [[swine]]);
#Mandatory [[postmortem]] inspection of every [[Body|carcass]];
#Sanitary standards established for [[slaughterhouse]]s and [[meat processing]] plants; and
#Authorized U.S. Department of Agriculture ongoing monitoring and inspection of slaughter and processing operations.

After 1906, many additional laws that further standardized the meat industry and its inspection were passed.

== Preemption of state law ==
In 2012, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[National Meat Assn. v. Harris]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, that the FMIA preempts a California law regulating the treatment of non-ambulatory livestock.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/national-meat-association-v-brown/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
