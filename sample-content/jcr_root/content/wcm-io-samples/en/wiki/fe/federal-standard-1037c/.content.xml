        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Federal Standard 1037C&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Telecommunications: Glossary of Telecommunication Terms&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a [[United States]] Federal Standard issued by the [[General Services Administration]] pursuant to the [[Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949]], as amended.

This document provides Federal departments and agencies a comprehensive source of definitions of terms used in [[telecommunications]] and directly related fields by international and U.S. Government telecommunications specialists.

As a publication of the U.S. Government, prepared by an agency of the U.S. Government, it appears to be mostly available as a [[public domain]] resource, but a few items are derived from [[United States copyright law|copyrighted]] sources: where this is the case, there is an attribution to the source.

This standard was superseded in 2001 by [[American National Standards Institute|American National Standard]] T1.523-2001, Telecom Glossary 2000, which is published by  [[Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions|ATIS]].  The old standard is still frequently used, because the new standard is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;not&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the public domain.
