A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ferrule&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (a corruption of [[Latin]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;viriola&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;small bracelet&amp;quot;, under the influence of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ferrum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;iron&amp;quot;) is a name for types of objects, generally used for fastening, joining, sealing or reinforcement. They are often narrow circular rings made from metal, or less commonly, plastic.

Most ferrules consist of a circular [[Clamp (tool)|clamp]] used to hold together and attach [[fiber]]s, [[wire]]s, or posts, generally by crimping, [[swage|swaging]], or otherwise deforming the ferrule to permanently tighten it onto the parts that it holds.

==Examples==
*The plastic sleeve preventing the ends of shoelaces from unraveling (called the [[aglet]])
*The metal sleeve which is crimped to hold the [[eraser]] in place on [[pencil]]s
*The metal band that binds the bristles or hair of a [[brush]] to its handle
*The metal ring which holds a [[chisel]] blade&amp;apos;s [[Tang (weaponry)|tang]] to the handle
*In [[fiber optic]] terminations, glass or plastic fibers are bonded to precision ferrules and polished for splitting or connecting two fibers together&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Ref patent

*The metal spike at the end of the shaft of an [[ice axe]]
*The margin of a cast crown that stabilizes root-canal treated teeth in restorative dentistry&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;amp;cmd=Search&amp;amp;Term=ferrule NIH search]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
*The bottom end of a flag stick on a golf course, which fits snugly into a hole in the cup
*The plastic sleeve that adorns the bottom of most steel and graphite golf club shafts just above the club head hosel. Originally designed to protect the shaft from damaging vibrations, it is now used mainly for aesthetic purposes
*The metal band used to prevent the ends of wooden instruments from splitting
*The semi-circular metal band that holds the fibers in place on the [[Bow (music)|Frog]]s of [[Bow (music)|bows]] for [[violin family]] instruments
*[[Compression fitting]]s for attaching tubing (piping) commonly have ferrules in them.
*A [[Wire rope#Swaged terminations|swaged termination]] type for wire rope
*The cap at the end of a cane or umbrella.
*The portion of a [[Cue stick|cue]] in [[Cue sports|pool, billiards and snooker]] that tops the {{Cuegloss|Shaft|shaft}} and to which the {{Cuegloss|Cue tip|tip}} is bonded; historically made of [[ivory]], now typically made of [[fiberglass]], [[phenolic resin]] or [[brass]]
*The male and female joints that join one section of a two-piece fishing rod
*A metal cap at the end of cable housing with a hole on bicycle or motorcycle control cables
*The metal sleeve that connects a [[hypodermic needle]] to a plastic [[Luer taper]] (which then connects to a [[syringe]] or [[intravenous therapy]] tubing.)
*A metal tube [[Crimp connection|crimped]] over stranded wire to secure it within a [[screw terminal]] usually with [[electrical insulation]] protecting any exposed portion of the wire not completely inside the screw terminal post.
*A metal or plastic ring used in plumbing as part of a [[compression fitting]] along with a slip-on nut for making a liquid-tight connection when joining pipe or tubing.
