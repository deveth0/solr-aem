&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pinking shears&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are [[scissors]], the blades of which are sawtoothed instead of straight.  They leave a [[zigzag]] pattern instead of a straight edge.

Pinking shears have a utilitarian function for cutting [[woven]] [[cloth]]. Cloth edges that are unfinished will easily fray, the weave becoming undone and threads pulling out easily. The sawtooth pattern does not prevent the fraying but limits the length of the frayed thread and thus minimizes damage.

==Other applications==
These scissors can also be used for decorative cuts and a number of patterns (arches, sawtooth of different aspect ratios, or asymmetric teeth) are available.  True dressmaker&amp;apos;s pinking shears, however, are not used for paper decoration because paper dulls the cutting edge.

==Etymology==
The cut produced by pinking shears may have given its name to (or be derived from) the plant name [[Pink (flower)|pink]], a [[flowering plant]] in the genus &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dianthus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (commonly called a carnation). The colour [[pink]] may have been named after these flowers, although the origins of the name are not definitively known. As the carnation has scalloped, or &amp;quot;pinked&amp;quot;, edges to its [[petals]], pinking shears can be thought to produce an edge similar to the flower.

The word &amp;quot;[[pink]]&amp;quot; can be used as a verb dating back to 1300 meaning &amp;quot;pierce, stab, make holes in&amp;quot;.  The French word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;piquer&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and Spanish word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;picar&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are derived from the Latin &amp;apos;&amp;apos;pungere&amp;apos;&amp;apos; meaning &amp;quot;to pierce, prick&amp;quot; and related to &amp;quot;[[pungent]]&amp;quot;.

==Patents==
Louise Austin of [[Whatcom_County,_Washington|Whatcom, Washington]], received [[United States]] [[patent]] number {{US patent|489,406}} on January 3, 1893, for &amp;quot;Pinking scissors.&amp;quot; The patent describes how &amp;quot;pinking scissors&amp;quot; are superior to the existing tools at the time, &amp;quot;pinking irons&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;pinking cutters.&amp;quot;   The operation of the shears are described as &amp;quot;pinking&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;scalloping.&amp;quot;  There are references to &amp;quot;cut ornamental openings in the body portion of fabrics,&amp;quot; but no references to the more utilitarian function of preventing fraying. One of the primary early uses of pinking shears was the formation of decorative edging for patchwork quilting squares.

Benjamin Luscalzo, of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], received United States patent number {{US patent|2600036}} on June 10, 1952, for his improvements to &amp;quot;pinking scissors&amp;quot; otherwise called &amp;quot;Pinking Shears&amp;quot;. He provided an adjustable tension means connected to one of the blades or jaws of the shears which kept the teeth in efficient cutting relationship so that the cutting plane is always perpendicular to the pivotal axis.  In other words, Benjamin Luscalzo brought traditional Scissors and the pinking blade together to create what we know today as &amp;quot;Pinking Shears&amp;quot;

Samuel Briskman, of Brooklyn, invented pinking shears in 1931 and received patents for them in 1934. He formed the Pinking Shears Corporation and set up a factory at 102 Prince Street in Manhattan. His firm milled the teeth into the blades. Wiss made the actual shears and had the exclusive sales in the USA and through their agents abroad. Briskman was also entitled to sell abroad under the name of Pinking Shears Corp. through his agents. He had one son, Artie, who worked with him. Sales fell off after a change in the type of fabric that was popular. Briskman died in February 1967, and was known as an inventor and philanthropist at that time.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://spiderbites.nytimes.com/pay_1967/articles_1967_02_00002.html |title=Pay Articles from February 1967 Part 3 - Site Map - The New York Times |publisher=Spiderbites.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-17}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Norman Wiss, Sr. was the one who pushed for and who managed the agreement with Briskman.
