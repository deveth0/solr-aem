&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pieter Aertsen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1508â€“3 June 1575), called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lange Pier&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Tall Pete&amp;quot;) because of his height, was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] historical painter. He was born and died in [[Amsterdam]], and painted there and in [[Antwerp]], though his genre scenes were influential in Italy.

==Biography==

As a youth, he apprenticed with [[Aertgen van Leyden|Allaert Claesz]]. He distinguished himself by painting domestic scenes in which he reproduced articles of furniture, cooking utensils, and so on, with marvellous fidelity. Later in life, he began documenting historical scenes. Several of his best works, including [[altarpiece]]s in various churches, were destroyed during the days surrounding the event known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Alteratie]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;quot;Changeover&amp;quot;, when Amsterdam formally reverted to Protestantism from Catholicism on 26 May 1578 at the start of the [[Eighty Year&amp;apos;s War]]. During the [[iconoclasm]] several paintings that had been commissioned by Catholic churches were destroyed.

An excellent specimen of his style is a painting of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Crucifixion]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{As of|2005}} on display in the [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp|Royal Museum of Fine Arts]] in Antwerp.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Aertsen was a member of Antwerp&amp;apos;s equivalent of the [[Academy of St Luke]].  In the official books of the Academy he is known as  &amp;quot;Langhe Peter, schilder&amp;quot; (Tall Peter, painter). His sons [[Pieter Pietersz the Elder|Pieter]], [[Aert Pietersz|Aert]], and [[Dirck Pietersz|Dirck]] became acclaimed painters, and other notable pupils trained in his workshop included [[Stradanus]] and Aertsen&amp;apos;s nephew, [[Joachim Beuckelaer]].
