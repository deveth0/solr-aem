&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pitstone&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (formerly &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pightelsthorn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[village]] and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] within the [[Aylesbury Vale]] district of [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].  It is located at the foot of the [[Chiltern Hills]], about seven miles east of [[Aylesbury]] and six miles south of [[Leighton Buzzard]].  It directly adjoins the village of [[Ivinghoe]], and the two villages share a number of their facilities.

The village name is [[Old English language|Anglo Saxon]] in origin, and means &amp;apos;Picel&amp;apos;s thorn tree&amp;apos;.  It was recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pincelestorne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Pitstone was given to the [[abbey]] at [[Ashridge]] by the [[Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall|Earl of Cornwall]] in 1283.  In 1290 [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] spent [[Christmas]] in Pitstone at the estate that had been given to the abbey, and stayed for five weeks, during which time he held [[Parliament of England|parliament]] in Ashridge.  His stay caused great inconvenience to the local inhabitants of the village, who were legally obliged to keep the king and his court.

More recently Pitstone was the site of a [[cement]] works which closed in the 1990s.  The site has now been demolished and has been redeveloped for housing and business use. The new housing district is named &amp;apos;Castlemead&amp;apos; (after the Castle Cement Company who were the last operators of the site) and the business area already contains numerous units with construction ongoing.

A notable building nearby is [[Pitstone Windmill]], which is owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. The windmill was formerly capable of rotating to face the prevailing wind, as evidenced by the wheel protruding from one side of the structure. Although it no longer retains this capacity, the wheel remains in place and the pivot point of the windmill is clearly visible.

Pitstone Green Museum provides some interesting insights into agricultural history and various supporting trades. The museum is located to the south of the village, on the site of a farm.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pitstone Hill&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, above the village, is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]], designated for its botanical interest.  The hill is crossed by the [[Ridgeway National Trail]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001557.pdf SSSI citation]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Pitstone has a [[Non-League football]] team [[Pitstone &amp;amp; Ivinghoe F.C.]] who play at The Recreation Ground on Vicarage Lane.
