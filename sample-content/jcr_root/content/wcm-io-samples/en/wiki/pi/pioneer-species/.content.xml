&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pioneer species&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are hardy [[species]] which are the first to [[Colonisation (biology)|colonize]] previously disrupted or damaged [[ecosystems]], beginning a chain of [[ecological succession]] that ultimately leads to a more biodiverse [[steady-state]] ecosystem.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite book|author=Duram, Leslie A.|title=Encyclopedia of Organic, Sustainable, and Local Food|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010|isbn=9780313359637|page=48|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YtldfGaOJ5IC&amp;amp;pg=PA48}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Since uncolonized land may have thin, poor quality soils with few nutrients, pioneer species are often hardy plants with adaptations such as long roots, root nodes containing [[Diazotroph|nitrogen-fixing bacteria]], and leaves that employ [[transpiration]]. Pioneer species will die creating [[plant litter]], and break down as &amp;quot;[[leaf mold]]&amp;quot; after some time, making new soil for [[secondary succession]] (see below), and nutrients for small fish and [[aquatic plant]]s in adjacent bodies of water.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Pioneer flora==
Examples of the plants and organism that colonize such areas are:{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

:Barren sand - [[Leymus|Lyme grass]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Leymus arenarius]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), [[Agropyron|Sea couch grass]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Agropyron pungens]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), [[Ammophila (Poaceae)|Marram grass]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ammophila breviligulata]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)
:Salt water - [[green algae]], [[Zostera|Marine eel grass]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Zostera|Zostera spp.]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), [[Pickleweed]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Salicornia virginica]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), and [[Spartina|Cordgrass]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hybrid Spartina Ã— townsendii&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;and&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Spartina anglica]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).
:Clear water - [[algae]], [[mosses]], [[Vallisneria|Freshwater eel grass]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Vallisneria americana]]).

==Pioneer fauna==
Pioneering [[fauna]] will colonize an area only after [[flora]] and [[fungi]] have inhabited the area. Soil fauna, ranging from microscopic [[protist]]s to larger [[invertebrate]]s, have a role in [[pedogenesis|soil formation]] and [[nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]]. [[Bacteria]] and fungi are the most important groups in the breakdown of organic detritus left by [[autotroph|primary producing plants]] such as [[orthent|skeletal soil]], [[moss]] and [[algae]]. Soil invertebrates enhance fungal activity by breaking down detritus. As soil develops, [[earthworm]]s and [[ant]]s alter soil characteristics. Worm burrows aerate soil and ant hills alter sediment particle size dispersal, altering soil character profoundly.

Though [[vertebrate]]s in general would not be considered pioneer species, there are exceptions. [[Natterjack toad]]s are specialists in open, sparsely vegetated habitats which may be at an early [[seral community|seral stage]]. Wide ranging generalists visit early succession stage habitats, but are not obligate species of those habitats because they use a mosaic of different habitats.

Vertebrates can effect early seral stages. [[Herbivore]]s may alter plant growth. Fossorial mammals could alter soil and plant community development. In a profound example, a [[bird colony|seabird colony]] transfers considerable nitrogen into infertile soils, thereby altering plant growth. A [[keystone species]] may facilitate the introduction of pioneer species by creating new [[ecological niche|niches]]. For example, [[beaver]]s may flood an area, allowing new species to immigrate.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;wallwork&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book | title=Ecology of Soil Animals | publisher=McGraw-Hill | author=Wallwork, John Anthony | year=1970 | isbn=0070941254}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Secondary succession and pioneer species==
Pioneer species can also be found in [[secondary succession]], such as an established ecosystem being reduced by an event such as: a [[forest fire]], [[deforestation]], or clearing;  quickly colonizing open spaces which previously supported vegetation.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Common examples of the plants in such areas include:{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
*[[Birch]] - &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Betula|Betula spp.]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
*[[Raspberry]] - &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Rubus|Rubus spp.]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
*[[Heath]]s - &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ericaceae|Ericaceae spp.]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
*[[Graminoids]], [[forb]]s, and [[wildflowers]] - [[native plant|native]], [[introduced species|introduced]], and [[invasive species]]: such as [[Fire ecology#Biotic responses and adaptations|fire dependent]] seed, [[Conifer cone|cone]], and [[resprouter]] [[chaparral]] genera.
