&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pinchus Krémègne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, aka &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pinchus Kremegne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-he|פנחס קרמין}}; {{lang-ru|Пинхус Кремень}}; 28 July 1890 – 5 April 1981), was a [[Lithuanian Jews|Litvak]]-French artist, primarily known as a sculptor, painter and [[lithography|lithographer]].

He was a native of [[Zhaludak]] near [[Lida]], and was a friend of both [[Chaim Soutine]] and [[Michel Kikoine]]. He studied sculpture at the [[Vilnius Academy of Art]]. He became a target of the [[pogrom]]s because he was a [[Jew]] and fled to [[Paris]] in 1912. In Paris, Kremegne joined the group of painters of [[Montparnasse]] and soon became one of the respected residents of [[La Ruche]]. In 1915, he gave up sculpture in order to dedicate himself to painting. It was he who encouraged Soutine to come to Paris. He left Paris to live in a small town in the [[Pyrenees]] called [[Ceret]]. This village, which is a little inland from [[Collioure]], attracted other painters such as Soutine. Although Soutine did not like the town very much, he completed many paintings there over a couple of years. He never settled but his compatriot Kremegne had a house built there around 1960. This small unassuming house, a reflection of the man himself, is nestled into the mountain and overlooks the village.

There was a falling out between the two men perhaps stemming from some ingratitude shown by Soutine towards a mutual &amp;apos;mecene&amp;apos; or benefactor who had helped out the two impoverished artists during their early careers in Paris. Kremegne&amp;apos;s house has new occupants and it is called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;La Miranda del Convent&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Later Ceret was to attract other painters such as [[Picasso]]. The Picasso walk meanders by Kremegne&amp;apos;s house and Ceret has an important museum exhibiting artists such as [[Matisse]], [[Picasso]], and others. There are a few Kremegne paintings on exhibition there as well.

Kremegne died in Ceret.

Underestimated as an artist today, he is overshadowed by [[Soutine]] and [[Chagall]]. He was remembered with a posthumous one-man show in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quartier Les Halles&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in Paris in the 1990s. A more structured vision of nature than Soutine&amp;apos;s, Kremegne&amp;apos;s last paintings prefigure the work of painters such as [[Leon Kossoff]] and [[Frank Auerbach]] in England.
