In [[Mexican cuisine]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;pico de gallo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-es|ˈpiko ðe ˈɣaʎo}}, literally &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[rooster]]&amp;apos;s [[beak]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), also called  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;salsa fresca&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a fresh, uncooked [[condiment]] made from chopped [[tomato]], white [[onion]], and [[Chili pepper|chilis]] (typically [[jalapeño]]s or [[Serrano pepper|serranos]]). Other ingredients may also be added, such as [[Shrimp (food)|shrimp]], [[avocado]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice or apple cider vinegar, fresh cilantro ([[Coriander#Leaves|coriander leaf]]), [[cucumber]], [[radish]] or firm fruit such as [[mango]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pico de gallo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; can be used in much the same way as other [[Salsa (sauce)|salsas]], [[Kenyan]] [[kachumbari]], or [[India]]n [[chutney]]s, but since it contains less liquid, it can also be used as a main ingredient in dishes such as [[taco]]s and [[fajita]]s.

The tomato-based variety is widely known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;salsa picada&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Mincing|minced]]/chopped [[sauce]]). In Mexico it is sometimes called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;salsa mexicana&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Mexican sauce). Because the colors of the red tomato, white onion, green chili are reminiscent of the colors of the [[Flag of Mexico|Mexican flag]], it is also sometimes called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;salsa bandera&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (flag salad).

In many regions of Mexico the term refers to any of a variety of [[salad]]s (including [[fruit salad]]s), [[Salsa (sauce)|salsa]], or [[Filling (cooking)|filling]]s made with [[tomato]], [[tomatillo]], [[avocado]], [[melon]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[jícama]], cucumber, [[papaya]], or mild chilis. The ingredients are tossed in lime juice and either [[hot sauce]] or [[chamoy]], then sprinkled with a salty [[chili powder]].

==Etymology==
According to [[food writer]] [[Sharon Tyler Herbst]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Sharon Tyler Herbst]], &amp;quot;[[Food Lover&amp;apos;s Companion]]&amp;quot;, 2nd ed., as quoted in Barron&amp;apos;s Educational Services, Inc. 1995:  www.Epicurious.com, retrieved 10/3/2007 [http://www.epicurious.com/tools/fooddictionary/search?query=pico+de+gallo]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;pico de gallo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;rooster&amp;apos;s beak&amp;quot;) is named thus because originally people ate it by pinching pieces between the [[thumb]] and [[forefinger]].

In their book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Rick Bayless]] and Deann Groen speculate that the name might allude to the [[bird feed]]-like texture and appearance of the mince.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Bayless, Rick; Groen, Deann. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In a 2010 press release, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that between 1998 and 2008, 1 out of 25 restaurant-associated foodborne illnesses in the [[United States]] with identified food sources had been traced back to restaurant salsa or guacamole.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/2010/r100712.htm |title=CDC Newsroom Press Release: July 12, 2010 |title=Salsa and Guacamole Increasingly Important Causes of Foodborne Disease |accessdate=2010 July 23}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; According to a July 13, 2010, news item by journalist Elizabeth Weise, a 2008 outbreak of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[salmonella]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the U.S. was traced back to the peppers used in salsa.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-07-13-Salsa14_ST_N.htm |title=CDC: Fresh salsa, guacamole linked to foodborne illnesses - USATODAY.com |author=Elizabeth Weise |accessdate=2010-07-23 |work=USA Today |date=July 13, 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Originally reported to the CDC by the New Mexico Department of Health, over the course of several months, the outbreak sickened a total of 1,442 people in 43 U.S. states and resulted in 286 hospitalizations.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) |title=Outbreak of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Salmonella serotype Saintpaul&amp;apos;&amp;apos; infections associated with multiple raw produce items--United States, 2008 |journal=MMWR Morb.

Rep. |volume=57 |issue=34 |pages=929–34 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18756191}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Weise reported that Michael Doyle, director of the University of Georgia&amp;apos;s Center for Food Safety, found refrigeration was critical to safe salsa; and also that using fresh garlic and fresh lime juice, instead of their more processed equivalents, inhibited the growth of bacteria.
