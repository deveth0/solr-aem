The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pixiphone&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a range of toy [[glockenspiel]]s (although they were inaccurately labelled as [[xylophones]] on their packaging). The larger Pixiphones had a &amp;apos;raiser-bar&amp;apos; which could be used to end a note abruptly, rather than letting it fade naturally. Although marketed as a children&amp;apos;s [[toy]], the Pixiphone could be tuned pitch-perfect and was very robust, resulting in many children using them at British schools.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/pixiphone.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

They were manufactured by Chas E. Methven Ltd, Chatham, Kent, England and distributed by Playcraft Toys Ltd England from the 1950s to the 1970s (or possibly later). The instrument was also used on the [[Badfinger]] song, &amp;quot;She Came Out of the Cold&amp;quot; which featured on the compilation album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Without You&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
