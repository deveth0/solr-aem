&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pierre Auguste Cot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (17 February 1837 – 2 August 1883) was a [[France|French]] painter of the [[Academic Classicism]] school.

==Life and career==
Cot was born in [[Bédarieux]], [[Hérault]], and initially studied at l&amp;apos;Ecole des Beaux-Arts in [[Toulouse]] before going to Paris. He studied under [[Leon Cogniet]], [[Alexandre Cabanel]] and [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]. In 1863 he made a successful debut at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]], and from the 1870s, his popularity grew quickly.

Cot enjoyed the patronage of the academic sculptor [[Francisque Joseph Duret|Francisque Duret]], whose daughter he married, and of Bouguereau, with whom he had also worked. Bouguereau painted a portrait of Cot&amp;apos;s daughter, Gabrielle. Bouguereau had dined with the Cot family to celebrate Gabrielle&amp;apos;s marriage to an architect named Zilin. The artist made a gift of the painting to the wife of Duret, Gabrielle&amp;apos;s grandmother.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Sotheby&amp;apos;s]] catalogue [http://www.sothebys.com/en/catalogues/ecatalogue.html/2011/19th-century-european-art-n08783#/r=/en/ecat.fhtml.N08783.html+r.m=/en/ecat.lot.N08783.html/43/+r.o=/en/ecat.notes.N08783.html/43/ notes and provenance.] The portrait has been known variously as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tête de jeune fille&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Head of a Young Girl&amp;quot;), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Portrait of Gabrielle Drienza&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Portrait de Madame Z&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Head of [Mme] Ailin, Gabrielle Cot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Cot won various prizes and medals, and in 1874 was made Chevalier of the [[Légion d&amp;apos;Honneur|Legion of Honour]].

==Works==
He created several works of lasting popularity, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Le Printemps&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, featuring two young lovers sitting upon a swing, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Storm (painting)|The Storm]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Both these paintings are on display at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]]; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Storm&amp;apos;&amp;apos; belongs to the museum while &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Le Printemps&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is owned privately.

Cot also was renowned for his [[portrait]]s, which made up the majority of his work.  The more enduring figurative work, such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Storm (painting)|The Storm]],&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is comparatively rare. Shortly after his death at the age of forty-six (2 August 1883), a subscription was undertaken for a commemorative monument to the artist, which was erected at Bédarieux in 1892.
