&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pierre-Paul Riquet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (June 29, 1609 (some sources say 1604) – October 4, 1680) was the [[engineer]] and [[canal]]-builder responsible for the construction of the [[Canal du Midi]].

==Background==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Paul Riquet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was born in [[Béziers]], [[Hérault]], [[France]]. As a youth, Riquet was only interested in mathematics and science. He married Catherine de Milhau at age 19. As a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[fermier général]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;farmer-general&amp;quot;) of [[Languedoc-Roussillon]], he was a [[tax farming|tax farmer]] responsible for the collection and administration of the [[gabelle]] (salt tax) in [[Languedoc]].   He was appointed collector in 1630.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;apos;hugh&amp;apos; /&amp;gt; Riquet became wealthy and was given permission by the King to levy his own taxes. This gave him greater wealth, which allowed him to execute grand projects with technical expertise.

==The Canal du Midi==
Riquet is the man responsible for building the 240-kilometre-long artificial [[waterway]] that links the southern coast of France to Toulouse to link to the canal/river system that ran across to the [[Bay of Biscay]], one of the great engineering feats of the 17th century. The logistics were immense and complex, so much so that other engineers including the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had discussed the idea but not proceeded with it. Even so, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] was keen for the project to proceed, largely because of the increasing cost and danger of transporting cargo and [[trade]] around southern [[Spain]] where [[pirates]] were common.

Planning, financing, and construction of the [[Canal du Midi]] completely absorbed Riquet from 1665 forward. Numerous problems occurred, including navigating around many hills and providing a system that would feed the canal with water through the dry summer months. Advances in [[Canal lock|lock]] engineering and the creation of a 6 million cubic metre [[artificial lake]]—the [[Bassin de St. Ferréol]] — provided solutions.

The high cost of construction depleted Riquet&amp;apos;s personal fortune and the seemingly insurmountable problems caused his sponsors, including Louis XIV, to lose interest. The canal was completed in 1681, eight months after Riquet&amp;apos;s death.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;apos;hugh&amp;apos;&amp;gt;{{cite book | last = McKnight | first = Hugh | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cruising French Waterways, 4th Edition | publisher = Sheridan House| year = 2005 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 8124-0152-1 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;apos;chandra&amp;apos;&amp;gt;{{cite book | last = Mukerji | first = Chandra | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Impossible Engineering | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2009 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-691-14032-2 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
