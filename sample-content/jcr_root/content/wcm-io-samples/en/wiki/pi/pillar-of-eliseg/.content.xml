The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pillar of Eliseg&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elise&amp;apos;s Pillar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Croes Elisedd&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in Welsh, stands near [[Valle Crucis Abbey]], [[Denbighshire]], [[Wales]], at {{gbmapping|SJ204442}}. It was erected by [[Cyngen ap Cadell]] (died 855), king of [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] in honour of his great-grandfather [[Elisedd ap Gwylog]]. The form &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eliseg&amp;apos;&amp;apos; found on the pillar is thought to be a mistake by the carver of the inscription.

The [[Latin]] inscription not only mentions several individuals described in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Historia Britonum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but also complements the information presented in that text. A generally accepted translation of this inscription, one of the longest surviving inscriptions from [[Viking|pre-Viking]] [[Wales]], is as follows:

:† Concenn son of Cattell, Cattell son of Brochmail, Brochmail son of Eliseg, Eliseg son of Guoillauc.
:† And that Concenn, great-grandson of Eliseg, erected this stone for his great-grandfather Eliseg.
:† The same Eliseg, who joined together the inheritance of Powys . . . throughout nine (years?) out of the power of the Angles with his sword and with fire.
:† Whosoever shall read this hand-inscribed stone, let him give a blessing on the soul of Eliseg.
:† This is that Concenn who captured with his hand eleven hundred acres [4.5 km²] which used to belong to his kingdom of Powys . . . and which . . . . . . the mountain
[the column is broken here. One line, possibly more, lost]
:. . . the monarchy . . . [[Magnus Maximus|Maximus]] . . . of Britain . . . Concenn, Pascent, Maun, Annan.
:† Britu son of [[Vortigern]], whom Germanus blessed, and whom Sevira bore to him, daughter of Maximus the king, who killed the king of the Romans.
:† Conmarch painted this writing at the request of king Concenn.
:† The blessing of the Lord be upon Concenn and upon his entire household, and upon the entire region of Powys until the Day of Judgement.

The Pillar was thrown down by the [[Roundhead]]s during the [[English Civil War]] and a grave under it opened. [[Edward Lhuyd]] examined the Pillar and copied the inscription in 1696. The lower half disappeared but the upper half was re-erected in 1779. The original inscription is now illegible.
