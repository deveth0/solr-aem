&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Siddhanta&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a [[Sanskrit]] term, roughly translates as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the Doctrine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the Tradition.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; It denotes the established and accepted view of a particular school within [[Indian philosophy]].

==Hindu philosophy==
This term is an established theological term within [[Hindu philosophy]] which denotes a specific line of theological development within a [[Hindu]] religious tradition. The traditional schools of Hindu philosophy have had their siddhantas established by their respective founders in the form of [[Sutra]]s (aphorisms). The Sutras are commented by a major philosopher in the respective traditions to elaborate upon the established doctrine by quoting from [[Hindu scriptures|the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;shastras&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] (scriptures) and using logic and [[pramana]]s (accepted source of knowledge). For example, in the tradition of [[Vedanta]], the author of the [[Brahma Sutra]] was [[Vyasa|Veda Vyasa]] and the commentators were [[Adi Shankara]], [[Ramanuja]] and [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] (each of whom eventually set up sub-schools within Vedanta). Also, in the tradition of [[mimamsa|Purva Mimamsa]], the author of the Sutra was [[Jaimini]] and the commentator was [[Shabaraswami]].

==Buddhist philosophy==
[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] scholars translate the term accurately as &amp;apos;tenet&amp;apos;. In Tibetan Scholar Konchog Jigmed Wangpo&amp;apos;s famous text on philosophical tenets, he writes: &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;The etymology for &amp;apos;tenet&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;siddhanta&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is: a tenet or a meaning which was made firm, decided upon, or established in reliance on the texts and reasoning and which will not be forsaken for something else. Dharmamitra&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Clear Words&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Commentary on Maitreya&amp;apos;s Ornament for Realisations&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;abhisamayalamkara karika prajnaparamita mitopadesha shastratike&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) says: &amp;apos;&amp;quot;Established conclusion [&amp;apos;&amp;apos;siddhanta&amp;apos;&amp;apos;] signifies one&amp;apos;s own established assertion which is thoroughly borne out by the texts and reasoning. Because one will not pass beyond this assertion, it is a conclusion.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

==Jaina philosophy==
For [[Jainism]], [[Jain Agamas|the texts]] vary between the three primary sects, with [[Sthanakavasis]] believing in no textual authority. Both the [[Digambara]] and [[Shvetambara]] believe that the &amp;quot;purest&amp;quot; Jain teachings were contained within the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Purvas]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which have been mostly lost to antiquity. Of the surviving Jain scriptures, the Digambara tend to focus upon the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Prakaranas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; while the Shvetambara focus upon the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Angas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Astronomy==
Early [[Indian astronomy]] is transmitted in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Siddhanta&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s: [[Varahamihira]] (6th century) in his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pancha-Siddhantika]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; contrasts five of these: The [[Surya Siddhanta]] besides the [[Paitamaha Siddhanta]]s (which is more similar to the &amp;quot;classical&amp;quot; [[Vedanga Jyotisha]]), the [[Paulisha Siddhanta|Paulisha]] and  [[Romaka Siddhanta|Romaka]] Siddhantas (directly based on Hellenistic astronomy) and the  [[Vasishta Siddhanta]].
