The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Auto &amp;amp; Technik Museum Sinsheim&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a technology museum in [[Sinsheim]], [[Germany]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Listed in {{Kursbuch}}208&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Opened in 1981, it is run by a registered association called &amp;quot;Auto &amp;amp; Technik Museum Sinsheim e.V.&amp;quot; which also runs the [[Technik Museum Speyer]]. {{As of|2004}}, it has more than 3,000 exhibits and an exhibition area of more than 50,000 m² (indoors and outdoors). In addition to exhibitions, the museum also has a 22m x 27m [[IMAX]] 3D theatre.  It receives more than 1 million visitors per year and is the largest privately owned museum in Europe.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;12 Nov 08&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://seniortravel.about.com/b/2008/09/18/auto-und-technik-museum-sinsheim-ferraris-and-more.htm - 12 Nov 08&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 2003, [[Air France]] donated one of its retiring [[Concorde]] [[aircraft]] (F-BVFB) to the museum. With a [[Tupolev Tu-144]]&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;as at 12 Nov 08&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.bargaintraveleurope.com/07/Germany_Sinsheim_Technik_Museum.htm as at 12 Nov 08&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  on display since 2001, it is the only place where both [[Supersonic transport|supersonic passenger aircraft]] are shown. Both are fully accessible by the public.

The museum&amp;apos;s alliance acquired a Russian [[Shuttle Buran|Buran space shuttle]] in 2004 which opened as a walk-in exhibition at the [[Technikmuseum Speyer]] on October 3, 2008.
