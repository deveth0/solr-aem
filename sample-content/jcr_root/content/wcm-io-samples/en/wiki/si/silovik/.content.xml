        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Silovik&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-rus|силови́к|p=sʲɪlɐˈvʲik}}; plural: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;siloviki&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, {{lang-rus|силовики́|p=sʲɪləvʲɪˈkʲi}}) is a [[Russian people|Russian]] word for politicians from the [[national security|security]] or [[military]] services, often the [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] of the former [[KGB]], [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel&amp;apos;noye Upravleniye|GRU]], [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]], [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] the [[Federal Narcotics Control Service]] and military or other security services who came into power. It can also refer to security-service personnel from any country or nationality.

==Derivation==
The term, which can be exactly translated as &amp;quot;people of force&amp;quot; (from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[wikt:сила#Russian|си́ла]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;force&amp;quot;), derives from the term &amp;quot;structures of force&amp;quot;, which appeared in the earlier [[Boris Yeltsin]] era (early 1990s) to denote the military-style uniformed services, including military proper, police ([[Ministry of Interior]]), national security ([[KGB]]/[[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]]) and some other structures. These &amp;quot;structures of force&amp;quot; formed a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;de facto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; higher level inner cabinet under Yeltsin and [[Vladimir Putin]]. Sometimes the term is translated as &amp;quot;strongman&amp;quot;, which is not so correct. The drawback of this translation is that it obscures the particular career background of these persons, as described above.

==Description==
Siloviki hope, that a common view in Russia is that they were generally non-ideological, were not corrupt, have a pragmatic law and order focus and have Russian national interests at heart. They pretend to be generally well-educated and bring past commercial experience to their government posts.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;willerton&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Willerton|first=John|title=Developments in Russian Politics|editor=White, Gitelman, Sakwa|publisher=Duke University Press|date=2005|volume=6|chapter=Putin and the Hegemonic Presidency|isbn=0-8223-3522-0}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Many assume that the siloviki have a natural preference for the reemergence of a strong Russian state and may be less sensitive towards certain aspects of the democratic system, which in turn makes many people consider them as the pro-[[People&amp;apos;s_Republic_of_China|Chinese]] faction.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;willerton&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

The siloviki do not form a cohesive group. They do not have a single leader and there is no common, articulated &amp;quot;silovik agenda&amp;quot;. However, according to John P. Willerton, these security-intelligence officials brought the work ethic and skills - that Putin apparently favoured - to the administration.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;willerton&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Persons and positions==
Senior siloviki under Putin&amp;apos;s presidency included [[Sergei Ivanov]], [[Viktor Ivanov (politician)|Viktor Ivanov]] and [[Igor Sechin]], who had close working relationships with Putin and held key positions in Putin&amp;apos;s governments. Willerton points out, however, that it is difficult to assess if their common security-intelligence background translates into common political preferences.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;willerton&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Following the [[2011 Russian protests]], Russian president [[Dmitri Medvedev]], having made promises of political reform, nevertheless appointed several siloviki to prominent positions in the government: [[Sergei Ivanov]] to chief of staff of the presidential administration; [[Dmitry Rogozin]] to deputy prime minister; and [[Vyacheslav Volodin]] to deputy chief of staff.&amp;lt;ref name=NYTSiloviki&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Political Promotions in Russia Appear to Belie President’s Promise of Reform|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/29/world/europe/medvedev-promotes-members-of-hard-line-faction-in-russia.html|accessdate=December 30, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 28, 2011|author=Andrew E.
