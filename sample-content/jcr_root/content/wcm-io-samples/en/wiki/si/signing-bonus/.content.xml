A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;signing bonus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;sign-on bonus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a sum of money paid to a new employee by a company as an incentive to join that company. They are often given as a way of making a [[Remuneration|compensation]] package more attractive to the employee (e.g., if the annual salary is lower than he or she desires). It also lowers the risk to the company as it is a one-time payment; for example, if the employee does not meet expectations, the company has not committed to a higher salary. Signing bonuses are often used in professional sports, and to recruit [[Graduation|graduates]] into their first jobs.

To encourage employees to stay at the organisation, there are often clauses in the contract whereby if the employee quits before a specified period, they have to return the signing bonus.
