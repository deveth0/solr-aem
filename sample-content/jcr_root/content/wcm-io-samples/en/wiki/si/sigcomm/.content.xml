&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;SIGCOMM&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]&amp;apos;s [[Special Interest Group]] on Data Communications, which specializes in the field of [[communication]] and [[computer network]]s. It is also the name of an annual &amp;apos;flagship&amp;apos; conference, organized by SIGCOMM, which is considered to be the leading conference in data communications and networking in the world. Known to have an extremely low acceptance rate (~10%), many of the landmark works in Networking and Communications have been published through it.

Of late, a number of workshops related to networking are also co-located with the SIGCOMM conference. These include Workshop on Challenged Networks (CHANTS), Internet Network Management (INM), Large Scale Attack Defense (LSAD) and Mining Network Data (MineNet).

SIGCOMM also produces two [[academic journal|refereed journal]]s, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Computer Communication Review&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (which appears quarterly), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which appears bi-monthly (the latter co-sponsored with [[IEEE]]).

The [[SIGCOMM Award]] is made annually for outstanding lifetime technical achievement in the fields of data and computer communications and the SIGCOMM Best Student Paper Award is made annually for the outstanding paper at that year&amp;apos;s conference.
