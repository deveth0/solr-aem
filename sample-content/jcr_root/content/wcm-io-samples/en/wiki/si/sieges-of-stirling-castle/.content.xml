There have been at least sixteen &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;sieges of [[Stirling Castle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a strategically important fortification in [[Stirling]], Scotland. Stirling is located at the crossing of the [[River Forth]], making it a key location for access to the north of Scotland. The castle changed hands several times between [[Kingdom of England|English]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] control during the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] (1296–1357).

In 1299, the castle was in English hands, when the constable, John Sampson, was besieged by the Scots. In 1304, [[Edward I of England]] besieged the Scots, deploying siege engines to force the garrison to surrender. In 1337, a siege by [[Sir Andrew Murray]] failed to retake the castle. Between 1571 and 1585, the castle was besieged three times by Scots factions during the reign of [[James I of England|James VI]]. In 1651, [[Oliver Cromwell]] captured the castle during his [[Third English Civil War|invasion of Scotland]]. The final siege took place in 1746, when [[Charles Edward Stuart]] besieged the castle during the final [[Jacobite Rising]].

After the defeat of [[William Wallace]]&amp;apos;s Scots army at the [[Battle of Falkirk (1298)|Battle of Falkirk]] in 1298, it took Edward I six years to gain full control of Scotland.  The last stronghold of resistance to English rule was Stirling Castle. Armed with twelve [[siege engine]]s, the English laid siege to the castle in April 1304.  For four months the castle was bombarded by lead balls (stripped from nearby church roofs), [[Greek fire]], stone balls, and even some sort of [[gunpowder]] mixture.  Impatient with lack of progress, Edward ordered his chief engineer, Master [[James of St. George]], to begin work on a new, more massive engine called [[Warwolf]] (possibly a [[trebuchet]]). The castle&amp;apos;s garrison of 30, led by [[Sir William Oliphant (died aft. 1313)|William Oliphant]], eventually were allowed to surrender on 20 July after Edward had previously refused to accept surrender until the Warwolf had been tested.

Despite previous threats, Edward spared all the Scots in the garrison and executed only one Englishman who had previously given over the castle to the Scots.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Marc Morris: Edward I, A Great and Terrible King&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Sir William Oliphant was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].
