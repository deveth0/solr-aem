__NOTOC__
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Six Dynasties&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Chinese character|Chinese]]: 六朝; [[Pinyin]]: Liù Cháo; 220 or 222 - 589&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=Endymion|title=Chinese history: A manual|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University, Asia Center for the Harvard-Yenching Institute|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-674-00249-4|page=11|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ERnrQq0bsPYC&amp;amp;pg=PA11|edition=Revised and enlarged}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) is a [[collective noun]] for six [[China|Chinese]] dynasties during the periods of the [[Three Kingdoms]] (220–280 AD), [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265–420), and [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] (420–589).

This period immediately followed the fall of the [[Han Dynasty]] in 220 AD, and was a period of disunity, instability and warfare. The period ended when [[Emperor Wen of Sui]] reunified Southern and Northern China and the [[Sui Dynasty]] began.

The term generally refers to two groupings of dynasties during that period:
* Six dynasties with capitals in [[Jiankang]] (the modern day [[Nanjing]]), and
* Six dynasties with legitimate lineage.

==Six Dynasties with capitals in Jiankang==

The six dynasties were:
# [[Eastern Wu]] (222–280)
# [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265–420)
# [[Liu-Song Dynasty|Liu Song Dynasty]] (420–479)
# [[Southern Qi]] (479–502)
# [[Liang Dynasty]] (502–557)
# [[Chen Dynasty]] (557–589)

This listing is based on the states that maintained national capitals at [[Jiankang]] near the [[Yangtze River]] (Chang Jiang ).  Xu Song (许嵩, Xǔ Sōng) in [[Tang Dynasty]] wrote a book, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jiankang Shilu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (建康实录, Jiànkāng Shílù), that provides a historical account of Jiankang, which gave rise to this scheme of naming.

==Six Dynasties with legitimate lineage==

These six dynasties were:
# [[Cao Wei]] (220–265)
# [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265–420)
# [[Liu-Song Dynasty|Liu Song Dynasty]] (420–479)
# [[Southern Dynasties|Qi Dynasty]] (479–502)
# [[Southern Dynasties|Liang Dynasty]] (502–557)
# [[Southern Dynasties|Chen Dynasty]] (557–589)

[[Sima Guang]], in his book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Zizhi Tongjian]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, used the [[Chinese era name|era names]] of these six dynasties as the [[Chinese era name|timeline]] to describe this period of history.  Later Chinese called this period the Six Dynasties period, or Wei Jin Southern and Northern Dynasties (魏晋南北朝, Wèi Jìn NánběiCháo).

==Poetry in the Six Dynasties==
{{Main|Six dynasties poetry}}
The Six Dynasties was an important period in the history of Chinese poetry, especially remarkable for its frank (for Classical Chinese poetry) descriptions of love and beauty. Especially important, and frequently translated into English, is the anthology &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[New Songs from the Jade Terrace]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, compiled by Xu Ling (507-83), under the patronage of Crown Prince Xiao Gang (Later Emperor Jien Wen) of the [[Liang Dynasty]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Watson, 92, and following&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Also significant, is the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zi Ye&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;quot;[[Midnight Songs poetry|Lady Midnight]]&amp;quot; style, supposedly originating with an eponymously named fourth-century [[Sing-song girls|professional singer]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Watson, 60&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Legacy==
As the first time in history that major political center of China being located to the [[Northern and southern China|south]], with surge in population and continual development of economy and culture, this transformed [[Northern and southern China|southern China]] from being remote territories to the economic center that can rival the [[Northern and southern China|north]] from [[Tang Dynasty]] onward.

[[Buddhism]], which first reached China in [[Silk_Road_transmission_of_Buddhism#Buddhism_in_the_Book_of_Later_Han|Eastern Han Dynasty]], flourished in the Six Dynasties (and simultaneously in the Northern Dynasties) and became a major religion in China since then.
