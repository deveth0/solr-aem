[[File:Henry Kirke White by Thomas Barber.jpg|thumb|right|Henry Kirke White]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Henry Kirke White&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (21 March 1785 – 19 October 1806) was an [[England|English]] [[poet]], who died at a young age.

White was born in [[Nottingham]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.proweb.co.uk/~roymat/hkw/hkw.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; the son of a butcher, a trade for which he was himself intended. However, he was greatly attracted to book-learning. By age seven, he was giving reading lessons (unbeknownst to the rest of the family, being offered after the household were abed) to a family servant.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|author=Kacirk, Jeffrey|title=Forgotten English|location=New York| publisher=William Morrow &amp;amp; Co|year=1997|isbn=0-688-15018-7}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; After being briefly apprenticed to a stocking-weaver, he was articled to a lawyer. While in this position, he excelled in studying [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Kacirk, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;op. cit.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Seeing the results of White&amp;apos;s diligent studies, his master offered to release him from his contract if he had sufficient means to go to college. He received encouragement from [[Capel Lofft]], the friend of [[Robert Bloomfield]], and published in 1803 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Clifton Grove, a Sketch in Verse, with other Poems&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, dedicated to [[Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire]]. The book was violently attacked in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Monthly Review&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 1804), but White was rewarded with a kind letter from [[Robert Southey]].

Through the efforts of his friends, he was able to enter [[St John&amp;apos;s College, Cambridge]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Venn|id=WHT804HK|name=White, Henry Kirke}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;His fondest hopes were realized. In October 1805, he went to Cambridge where, by unexampled industry, he speedily attained distinction . .&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Robert Chambers, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Book of Days&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [1864])&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; having spent a year beforehand with a private tutor, the Rev Lorenzo Grainger at [[Winteringham]], Lincolnshire. Close application to study induced a serious illness, and fears were entertained for his sanity, but he went into residence at Cambridge, with a view to taking holy orders, in the autumn of 1805. The strain of continuous study proved fatal.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;But he had long overtaxed his strength. At the end of one short year . . exhausted nature sank beneath incessant toil and anxiety.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Chambers, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;op. cit.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was buried in the church of [[All Saints Church, Cambridge|All Saints Jewry]], Cambridge, which stood opposite the gates of St John&amp;apos;s College, but has since been demolished. The genuine piety of his religious verses secured a place in popular hymnology for some of his hymns. Much of his fame was due to sympathy inspired by his early death; but [[Lord Byron]] agreed with Southey about the young man&amp;apos;s promise.

His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Remains&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, with his letters and an account of his life, were edited (5 vols., 1807–1822) by Robert Southey. See prefatory notices by [[Nicholas Harris Nicolas|Sir Harris Nicolas]] to his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Poetical Works&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (new ed., 1866) in the [[Aldine Press]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;British poets&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; by Harry Kirke Swann in the volume of selections (1897) in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Canterbury Poets&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; and by [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater]] to the edition in the &amp;quot;Muses&amp;apos; Library.&amp;quot; See also John Thomas Godfrey and [[J. Ward]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Homes and Haunts of Henry Kirke White&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1908).
