        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Heraclea Pontica&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|ɛ|r|ə|ˈ|k|l|iː|ə|_|ˈ|p|ɒ|n|t|ɨ|k|ə}}; {{lang-el|Ἡράκλεια Ποντική}} &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hērakleia Pontikē&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; modern day [[Karadeniz Ereğli]], in the [[Zonguldak Province]] of [[Turkey]], on the [[Black Sea]]), an ancient city on the coast of [[Bithynia]] in [[Asia Minor]], at the mouth of the river [[Lycus (river of Bithynia)|Lycus]]. It was founded by the Greek city-state of [[Megara]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;For report of Boeotian involvement see [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus%2e+5%2e26%2e7 Pausanias 5.26.7]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;c&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.560-558 and was named after [[Heracles]] whom the Greeks believed entered the underworld at a cave on the adjoining Archerusian promontory ([[Cape Baba]]).

The colonists soon subjugated the native [[Mariandyni]]ans but agreed to terms that none of the latter, now [[Helots|helot]]-like serfs, be sold into slavery outside their homeland. Prospering from the rich, fertile adjacent lands and the sea-fisheries of its natural harbor, Heraclea soon extended its control along the coast as far east as Cytorus (Gideros, near [[Cide]]), eventually establishing Black Sea colonies of its own ([[Cytorus (ancient settlement)|Cytorus]], [[Callatis]] and [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesus]]).

The prosperity of the city, rudely shaken by the [[Galatia]]ns and the [[Bithynia]]ns, was utterly destroyed in the [[Mithridatic Wars]]. It was the birthplace of the philosopher [[Heraclides Ponticus]].

The Greek historical author [[Memnon of Heraclea]] (fl. 1st century AD) wrote a local history of Heraclea Pontica in at least sixteen books. The work has perished, but [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bibliotheca&amp;apos;&amp;apos; preserves a compressed account of books 9–16, seemingly the only ones extant in his day. These books run from the rule of the tyrant [[Clearchus of Heraclea|Clearchus]] (c. 364–353 BC) to the later years of [[Julius Caesar]] (c. 40 BC) and contain many colorful accounts including the Byzantine introduction of the barbarian [[Gauls]] into Asia where they first allied themselves with the Heracleans and later turned violently against them.

At present, it is the Turkish city of [[Karadeniz Ereğli]].
