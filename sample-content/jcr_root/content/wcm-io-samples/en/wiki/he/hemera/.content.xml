        text="&lt;p&gt;{{Greek myth (primordial)}}
In [[Greek mythology]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hemera&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-grc|Ἡμέρα}}, &amp;quot;[[day]]&amp;quot;, {{IPA-el|hɛːméra|pron}}) was the personification of day and one of the [[Greek primordial deities]]. She is the goddess of the daytime and, according to [[Hesiod]], the daughter of [[Erebos]] and [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] (the goddess of night).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Hesiod. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Theogony]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 124-125.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Hemera is remarked upon in [[Cicero]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[De Natura Deorum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, where it is logically determined that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dies&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Hemera) must be a god, if [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] is a god.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Cicero. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Natura Deorum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 3.17.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The poet [[Bacchylides]] states that Nyx and [[Chronos]] are the parents, but [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] in his preface to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fabulae&amp;apos;&amp;apos; mentions [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] as the mother/father and Nyx as her sister.

She was the female counterpart of her brother and consort, [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]] (Light), but neither of them figured actively in myth or [[Cult (religion)|cult]]. Hyginus lists their children as Uranus, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], and [[Thalassa (mythology)|Thalassa]] (the primordial sea goddess), while [[Hesiod]] only lists [[Thalassa (mythology)|Thalassa]] as their child.

According to Hesiod&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theogony&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Hemera left [[Tartarus]] just as Nyx entered it; when Hemera returned, Nyx left:&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Hesiod. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theogony&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 744.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
:&amp;quot;Nyx and Hemera draw near and greet one another as they pass the great threshold of bronze: and while the one is about to go down into the house, the other comes out at the door.&amp;quot;

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] seems to confuse her with [[Eos]] when saying that she carried [[Cephalus]] away. Pausanias makes this identification with Eos upon looking at the tiling of the royal portico in [[Athens]], where the myth of Eos and Kephalos is illustrated. He makes this identification again at [[Amyklai]] and at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], upon looking at statues and illustrations where Eos (Hemera) is present.
