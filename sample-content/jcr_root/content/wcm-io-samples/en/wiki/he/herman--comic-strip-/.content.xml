        text="&lt;p&gt;[[File:Herman81504.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Jim Unger&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herman&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (August 15, 2004)]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herman&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[comic strip]] written and drawn by [[Jim Unger]]. While the [[daily strip|daily]] ran as a single panel with a typeset caption, it expanded on [[Sunday strip|Sunday]] as a full multi-panel strip with balloons.

It was syndicated from 1975 to 1992, when Unger retired. In 1997, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herman&amp;apos;&amp;apos; returned to syndication with a mix of classic strip reprints and occasional new material.

==Characters and story==
The eponymous Herman is actually anybody within the confines of the strip&amp;amp;mdash;a man, a woman, a child, any animal or even an extraterrestrial. All characters are rendered in Unger&amp;apos;s unique style as hulking, beetle-browed figures with pronounced noses and jaws, and often sport comically understated facial expressions.

An earlier strip, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herman&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, created by [[Clyde Lamb]], published from 1950 through 1966, had no relation to Unger&amp;apos;s strip.

==Themes==
While there is no apparent continuity to the daily panels, there are several recurring themes:
*Married life: Wife: &amp;quot;What would you rate me as? A 10? 9? 8? 7? 6? 5? 4, 3? (pause) Not 2!&amp;quot; Husband: &amp;quot;Keep going.&amp;quot;
*Bad cooking: A woman says to her husband, &amp;quot;I made you a meat pie and the dog ate it,&amp;quot; to which the husband replies, &amp;quot;I&amp;apos;ll miss the dog.&amp;quot;
*Strange neighbors: A television comes crashing through the wall. Outside, a man yells &amp;quot;You missed!&amp;quot;
*The elderly: &amp;quot;There&amp;apos;s an elephant on TV, and Grandma&amp;apos;s throwing peanuts at it!&amp;quot;
*Animals: One penguin to another. &amp;quot;We&amp;apos;d have arrived earlier, but our iceberg hit a ship.&amp;quot;
*Children in school: &amp;quot;Don&amp;apos;t drag your fingernails on the chalkboard, Niles,&amp;quot; a teacher with shattered glasses and standing-up hair says.
*Intelligent babies: A man steps into the baby&amp;apos;s room with a bottle. &amp;quot;It&amp;apos;s about time! Another five minutes, and I&amp;apos;d have died of thirst!&amp;quot;
*Restaurants: A waiter dumps the customer&amp;apos;s food on the tablecloth. &amp;quot;Terribly sorry about this, but we&amp;apos;re short of plates.&amp;quot;
*Life in prison: Two prisoners have been caught cutting the bars from their cell window. &amp;quot;We found it quite stuffy in here, warden.&amp;quot;
*Art: A painting depicts a single half-circle at the bottom of the canvas: &amp;quot;This one&amp;apos;s called &amp;apos;Here Comes the Sun.&amp;apos;&amp;quot;
*Hunting and fishing: A hunter with the rifle realizes he has just blown the landing gear off of an airborne 747.
*People with bizarre ailments or injuries: A man in the hospital has a surgical scar that covers the perimeter of his torso. &amp;quot;It took us a while to find your appendix,&amp;quot; the doctor explains.
*Encounters with extraterrestrial life: A UFO has been pulled over for speeding. &amp;quot;Ignorance of the law is no excuse, buddy!&amp;quot;
*Ordinary people thrust into bizarre situations: A man on a modern-day park bench encounters a Viking, who asks &amp;quot;Is the war still on?&amp;quot;
*Being overweight: An overweight man stands on a bathroom scale, and asks his wife, &amp;quot;What do you mean the needle&amp;apos;s broken off?&amp;quot;
*Mispronounced words: A sheriff&amp;apos;s deputy brings the sheriff a cat. The sheriff says &amp;quot;I said &amp;apos;Round up a POSSE!&amp;apos;.&amp;quot;
*Courts: A judge does not know that the defendant he is speaking to is a plywood cutout. &amp;quot;You have been found guilty of forgery.&amp;quot;
*Strange inventions: A man has a giant showerhead over his house. &amp;quot;I get a good deal on fire insurance.&amp;quot;
*Medical: Doctor tells overweight patient &amp;quot;Walk two miles per day, but not on Morning Glory Circle.&amp;quot;

Several [[Anthology|collections]] of the comic strip were printed.

==Awards==
Unger received the [[National Cartoonists Society]]&amp;apos;s Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1982 and 1987 for his work on the strip.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.reuben.org National Cartoonists Society]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
