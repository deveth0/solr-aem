&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herminie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[census-designated place]] (CDP) in [[Sewickley Township, Pennsylvania|Sewickley Township]], [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]].

==History==
Herminie was named for Herminie Berwind, whose husband, Charles Berwind, was President of the Ocean Coal Company.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;oldminer&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://patheoldminer.rootsweb.ancestry.com/ocean.html |title=Ocean No. 1 Mine (Herminie Mine) |accessdate=2008-06-07 |last=Washlaski |first=Raymond A. |coauthors=Ryan P. Washlaski, Peter E. Starry, Jr. |date=2008-05-14 |work=Virtual Museum of Coal Mining in Western Pennsylvania }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The first mine at Herminie, known as the &amp;quot;Ocean No. 1 Mine,&amp;quot; was opened in 1893 by Berwind-White Coal Company, of which Ocean Coal Company was a subsidiary. Fifty double houses were built for miners, plus five single-family houses for managers on Church Street. By 1900, the mine employed 271 people.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;oldminer&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Herminie was the scene of two major strikes. During the [[Westmoreland County Coal Strike of 1910–1911]], miners were evicted from company-owned houses, which were used to house strikebreakers, predominantly southern Blacks. The strike was unsuccessful from the strikers&amp;apos; perspective. Another strike in 1922 resulted in recognition of the [[United Mine Workers]] union.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;oldminer&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Ocean No. 1 Mine closed in 1938 due to water problems, although other mines in the nearby area continued operating.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;oldminer&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
