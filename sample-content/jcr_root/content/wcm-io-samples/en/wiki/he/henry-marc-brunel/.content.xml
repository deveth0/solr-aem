        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Henry Marc Brunel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (27 June 1842 – 7 October 1903) was the second son of the celebrated [[England|English]] [[engineer]] [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], and followed his father&amp;apos;s footsteps in becoming a [[civil engineer]].

Brunel attended [[King&amp;apos;s College London]] from 1859–1861, and afterward attained experience in civil engineering through serving out various apprenticeships. He developed an interest in acting as a hobby, becoming a member of the Scientific and Amateur Dramatic Societies, and also contributed to his brother&amp;apos;s biography of their father (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Life of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Civil Engineer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1870).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;BrisUniArchive&amp;quot;&amp;gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/03021207.html|title=Brunel Collection: Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806-1859) papers |publisher=Archives Hub |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Brunel is noted for a partnership from 1878 with Sir [[John Wolfe-Barry]], with whom he designed the [[Blackfriars Railway Bridge]] over the [[River Thames]] in central [[London]]. Their other works included the docks at [[Barry, Wales|Barry]] in south [[Wales]] and the Creagan Bridge, a railway bridge over the narrows of [[Loch Creran]] in [[Scotland]] (jointly credited to Wolfe-Barry, Brunel and E.M. Crutwell). Sir [[Alexander Gibb]] was a pupil of Brunel and Wolfe-Barry in 1895.

He also designed the [[SS Chauncy Maples|SS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chauncy Maples&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], which was built in Glasgow in 1899 and transported overland to [[Lake Nyasa]] in Africa, where it served for more than one hundred years as a mission and hospital clinic.

Brunel is buried with his father, grandfather, and other family members at Kensal Green Cemetery in London.
