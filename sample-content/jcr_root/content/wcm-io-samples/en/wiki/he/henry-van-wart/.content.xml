&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Henry van Wart&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1784 - 1873), an American who became British by special act of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], founded the [[Birmingham]] Stock Exchange and served as one of Birmingham&amp;apos;s first [[Alderman|Aldermen]] and a director of the Birmingham Banking Company.

He was married to Sarah Irving, the sister of author [[Washington Irving]]. They had four children: William (1812 - 1868), Matilda (b. 1814), Marianne (b. 1816). and George (b. 1817; later a [[wine]] merchant). William later named his first- born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Washington Irving Van Wart&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (b. 1836), whose niece in turn was called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rosalinda Irving Van Wart&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (b. 1874).

Henry and Sarah met when he was employed by her family&amp;apos;s [[New York]] company, Irving &amp;amp; Smith, and they moved to [[England]] when he was tasked with opening a [[Liverpool]] branch of the firm.

After that enterprise failed, they moved to Birmingham, and he set up a profitable business, exporting the city&amp;apos;s goods to America.

Washington Irving lived with the van Warts at four of their homes in Birmingham, light- heartedly christening two of these buildings &amp;quot;Castle van Tromp&amp;quot; and writing some of his most successful stories at them.

He is also known to have worshipped at St Paul&amp;apos;s Church in St Paul&amp;apos;s Square, Birmingham.

Van Wart developed a friendship with [[Louisiana]] businessman [[Frederick W. Tilton]], who became Van Wart&amp;apos;s agent in New Orleans. Tilton endowed the library at [[Tulane University]].
