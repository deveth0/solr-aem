&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Heinrich Christian Schumacher&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (September 3, 1780 &amp;amp;ndash; December 28, 1850) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[Denmark|Danish]] [[astronomer]].

==Biography==
He was born at [[Bad Bramstedt|Bramstedt]], in [[Duchy of Holstein|Holstein]], and studied at [[Kiel]], [[Jena]], [[Copenhagen]], and [[Göttingen]]. In 1810, he became adjunct professor of astronomy in Copenhagen. He directed the [[Mannheim]] observatory from 1813 to 1815, and then became professor of astronomy in Copenhagen.

From 1817 he directed the triangulation of Holstein, to which a few years later was added a complete [[Geodetic surveying|geodetic survey]] of [[Denmark]] (finished after his death). For the sake of the survey, an observatory was established at [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], and Schumacher resided there permanently. He was chiefly occupied with the publication of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ephemerides&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (11 parts, 1822&amp;amp;ndash;1832) and of the journal &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Astronomische Nachrichten]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (founded by himself in 1821 and still being published), of which he edited thirty-one volumes.

In 1827 he was elected member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], and in 1829 he won the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]]. His [[portrait]] now hangs in the Development Office of [[the Royal Society]].

==Family==
His son, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Richard Schumacher&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1827–1902), was his assistant from 1844 to 1850 at the conservatory at Altona. Having become assistant to [[Carlos Guillermo Moesta]] (1825–1884), director of the observatory at [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago de Chile]], in 1859, he was associated with the [[Chile]]an geodesic survey in 1864. Returning in 1869, he was appointed assistant astronomer at Altona in 1873, and afterwards at [[Kiel]].

H. C. Schumacher&amp;apos;s nephew, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Christian Andreas Schumacher&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1810–1854), was associated with the geodetic survey of [[Denmark]] from 1833 to 1838, and afterwards (1844–1845) improved the [[Pulkowa Observatory|observatory at Pulkowa]].
