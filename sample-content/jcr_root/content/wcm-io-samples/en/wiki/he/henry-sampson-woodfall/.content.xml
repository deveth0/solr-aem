&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Henry Sampson Woodfall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (21 June 1739 – 12 December 1805) was an English printer and journalist. He was born and lived in [[London]].

His grandfather, Henry Woodfall (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;c.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1686 – 1747), was the author of the ballad &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Darby and Joan]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, for which John Darby and his wife were the originals; HS Woodward&amp;apos;s grandfather Woodfall had been apprenticed in 1701 to Darby, a printer in Bartholomew Close in the [[Little Britain, London|Little Britain]] area of London, who died in 1730.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Woodfall, Henry Sampson}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The grandfather Woodfall printed many of the works of [[Alexander Pope]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|title=Pope and Woodfall|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ybIRAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA377|date=19 May 1855|journal=Notes and Queries|pages=377-378}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; HS Woodfall&amp;apos;s uncle George was a bookseller in Charing Cross. HS Woodfall&amp;apos;s father, Henry Woodfall (1713 – 1769), was the printer of the newspaper the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Public Advertiser]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and HS Woodfall was [[apprenticeship|apprenticed]] to his father. At the age of nineteen, HS Woodfall took over the control of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Public Advertiser&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In it appeared, between 21 January 1769 and 21 January 1772, the famous letters of &amp;quot;[[Junius]].&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=Junius|author=Wade, John|chapter=Preliminary Esssay|year=1890|volume=vol. 1|location=London|publisher=George Bell &amp;amp; Sons|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_3MNAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA1}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In December 1769 Woodfall published a potentially actionable &amp;quot;Letter to the King&amp;quot; by Junius that brought legal charges against Woodfall and five others; Woodfall&amp;apos;s case went before a jury in June 1770 but was dismissed in November 1770.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|author=Lee, Anthony W.|chapter=The Education of Henry Sampson Woodfall, Newspaperman|title=Mentoring in Eighteenth-Century British Literature and Culture|year=2010|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6SAT3TjE4R0C&amp;amp;pg=PA163}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Woodfall sold his interest in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Public Advertiser&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1793. His son George Woodfall (1767 – 1844) was also in the family printing business.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Woodfall, George}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

HS Woodfall&amp;apos;s younger brother, [[William Woodfall]] (1746–1803), a journalist, established in 1789 a daily paper called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Diary, or Woodfall&amp;apos;s Register&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in which, for the first time, reports of [[Parliament of England|parliament]]ary debates were published on the morning after they had taken place.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|chapter=obituary notice for William Woodfall|title=Monthly Magazine and British Register|year=1803|page=280|volume=vol. 16|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AFIoAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA280&amp;amp;lpg=PA280}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
