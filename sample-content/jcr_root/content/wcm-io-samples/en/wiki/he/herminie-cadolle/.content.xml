&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herminie Cadolle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1845–1926) was the inventor of the modern [[brassiere|bra]] and founder of the Cadolle [[lingerie]] house.

Cadolle was a close friend of the [[France|French]] insurrectionist [[Louise Michel]], and it was this connection that led her to leave for the safety of [[Buenos Aires]]. Here, in 1887, Herminie opened a shop selling made-to-measure underwear.

Returning to [[Paris]] in 1889, she opened a similar lingerie workshop on the street &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Chaussée d&amp;apos;Antin]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, where she invented a two-piece undergarment called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;le bien-être&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the wellbeing). The lower part was a corset for the waist and the upper supported the breasts by means of shoulder straps. She exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Great Exposition of 1900]] and by 1905 the upper half was being sold separately as a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;soutien-gorge&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (literally, &amp;quot;support for the throat&amp;quot;, but &amp;apos;&amp;apos;gorge&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in old French meant breast), the name by which bras are still known in France.

Herminie became a fitter of bras to queens, princesses, dancers, and actresses. [[Mata Hari]] was among her customers. She was also the first to use cloth incorporating rubber (elastic) thread. Cadolle&amp;apos;s business is still running today.
