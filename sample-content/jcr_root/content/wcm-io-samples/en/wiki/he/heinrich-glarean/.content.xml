        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Heinrich Glarean&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Glareanus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (June 1488 – 28 March 1563) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[music theory|music theorist]], poet and humanist. He was born in [[Mollis]] (in the canton of [[Glarus]], hence his name) and died in [[Freiburg]].

After a thorough early training in music, he enrolled in the [[University of Cologne]], where he studied [[theology]], [[philosophy]], and [[mathematics]] as well as music. It was there that he wrote a famous poem as a tribute to [[Emperor Maximilian I]]. Shortly afterwards, in [[Basle]], he met [[Erasmus]] and the two humanists became lifelong friends.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Miller, Grove, Vol. VII p. 422-423&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Glarean&amp;apos;s first publication on music, a modest volume entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Isogoge in musicen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was in 1516. In it he discusses the basic elements of music; probably it was used for teaching. But his most famous book, and one of the most famous and influential works on music theory written during the [[Renaissance]], was the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dodecachordon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which he published in [[Basle]] in 1547. This massive work includes writings on philosophy and biography in addition to [[music theory]], and includes no less than 120 complete compositions by composers of the preceding generation (including [[Josquin des Prez|Josquin]], [[Johannes Ockeghem|Ockeghem]], [[Jacob Obrecht|Obrecht]], [[Heinrich Isaac|Isaac]] and many others). In three parts, it begins with a study of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]], who wrote extensively on music in the sixth century; it traces the use of the musical modes in plainsong (e.g. [[Gregorian chant]]) and [[monophony]]; and it closes with an extended study of the use of modes in [[polyphony]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Miller, Grove, Vol. VII p. 423-4&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The most significant feature of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dodecachordon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (literally, &amp;quot;12-stringed instrument&amp;quot;) is Glarean&amp;apos;s proposal that there are actually twelve modes, not eight, as had long been assumed, for instance in the works of the contemporary theorist [[Pietro Aron]]. The additional four modes included authentic and plagal forms of [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]] (modes 9 and 10) and [[Ionian mode|Ionian]] (modes 11 and 12) — the modes equivalent to minor and major scales, respectively. Glarean went so far as to say that the Ionian mode was the one most frequently used by composers in his day.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Miller, Grove, Vol. VII p. 423&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Miller, Grove, Vol. VII p. 423&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The influence of his work was immense. Many later theorists, including [[Gioseffo Zarlino|Zarlino]], accepted the twelve modes, and though the distinction between plagal and authentic forms of the modes is no longer of contemporary interest (reducing the number to six), Glarean&amp;apos;s explanation of the musical modes remains current today.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Miller, Grove, Vol. VII p. 423&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
