&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hesychius of Miletus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Greece|Greek]] chronicler and biographer, surnamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Illustrius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, son of an advocate, flourished at [[Constantinople]] in the 6th century AD during the reign of [[Justinian I|Justinian]].

According to [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] (cod. 69) he was the author of three important works:

#A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Compendium of [[Universal History]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in six books, from Belus, the reputed founder of the [[Assyria]]n empire, to [[Roman Emperor Anastasius I|Anastasius I]] (d. 518). A considerable fragment has been preserved from the sixth book, a history of Byzantium from its earliest beginnings till the time of [[Constantine the Great]].
#A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Biographical Dictionary of Learned Men&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, arranged according to classes (poets, philosophers), the chief sources of which were the works of [[Aelius Dionysius]] and of [[Herennius Philo]]. Much of it has been incorporated in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Suda]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as we learn from that book. It is disputed, however, whether the words in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Suda&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;of which this book is an epitome&amp;quot;) mean that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Suda&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s compiler himself epitomized the work of Hesychius, or whether they are part of the title of an already epitomized Hesychius used in the compilation of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Suda&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The second view is more generally held. The epitome referred to, in which alphabetical order was substituted for arrangement in classes and some articles on Christian writers added as a concession to the times, is assigned from internal indications to the years 829-837. Both it and the original work are lost, with the exception of the excerpts in Photius and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Suda&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. A smaller compilation, chiefly from [[Diogenes Laertius|Diogenes Laërtius]] and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Suda&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, with a similar title, is the work of an unknown author of the 11th or 12th century.
#A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;History of the Reign of [[Justin I]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (518–527) and the early years of Justinian, completely lost.
In 1663 [[Gilles Ménage]] published an anonymous &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vita Aristotelis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; that is commonly attributed to Hesychius.

Photius praises the style of Hesychius, and credits him with being a veracious historian.

Editions; [[Johann Caspar von Orelli|J. C. Orelli]] (1820) and [[J. Flach]] (1882); fragments in [[C. W. Müller]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Frag. hist. Graec.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; iv. 143 and in [[Theodor Preger]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Scriptores originis Constantinopolitanae&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, i. (1901); &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pseudo-Hesychius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, by J Flach (1880).
