&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Heavenly&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a [[power metal]]/[[neo-classical metal]] band from [[Paris, France]], was formed in 1994 by vocalist [[Benjamin Sotto]] and drummer Max Pilo. They were originally a cover band and played under the name of &amp;apos;Satan&amp;apos;s Lawyer&amp;apos; before evolving into a full-fledged [[Helloween]]-influenced [[power metal]] outfit, and releasing a three track demo with new guitarist Anthony Parker. However, Parker&amp;apos;s time with the band was to be short lived, leaving before a record deal with [[Noise Records]] was clinched. Heavenly then found a replacement in Chris Savourey and completed their lineup with bassist Laurent Jean.

In 2000, Heavenly released their debut album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Coming from the Sky]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Although it was largely shunned by the media, the album proved a hit with metal fans and its success helped Heavenly land an appearance at the French Hard Rock Festival. With the arrival of a keyboardist [[Frédéric Leclercq]] and the replacement of departed bassist Laurent Jean with Piere-Emmanuel Pelisson, Heavenly underwent another lineup change shortly before they supported [[Stratovarius]] on their &amp;apos;Infinite&amp;apos; tour. Chris Savourey left soon afterwards, and Frédéric Leclercq took on his role as the band&amp;apos;s guitarist.

Heavenly released their second album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sign of the Winner]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 2001, and received positive feedback from both fans and media alike. For their following support slot on [[Edguy]]&amp;apos;s European tour, Charley Corbiaux joined as a second guitarist, and has since become a permanent addition to Heavenly&amp;apos;s ranks.

After appearing at [[Wacken Open Air]] (the world&amp;apos;s biggest metal festival) in 2002, Heavenly set to work recording their third album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dust to Dust (Heavenly album)|Dust to Dust]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was eventually released in early 2004, further solidifying their status as one of France&amp;apos;s premier [[power metal]] bands.

In 2006, Heavenly released their 4th album, titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Virus (Heavenly album)|Virus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It is a departure from previous efforts, incorporating less double-bass drumming and expanding Sotto&amp;apos;s vocal range.

In December 2009, they released their 5th album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Carpe Diem (Heavenly album)|Carpe Diem]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

According to Heavenly&amp;apos;s Website, they will be opening for [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] during their French Tour.
