He joined the Army as a lieutenant in the 3rd (or Scots} Guards in 1819. He was promoted to captain of the [[Royal Ulster Rifles|83rd Regiment]] in 1824, major in 1826 and lieutenant-colonel in 1829. In 1837 he was active in suppressing the [[History of Canada#The Rebellions of 1837-38|Canadian rebellion]], after which he was appointed in 1841 colonel and [[aide-de-camp]] to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].

He played a distinguished part in India as a brigadier-general in 1848–49, chosen to command the column sent from Bombay to co-operate with Lord Gough&amp;apos;s army in the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]]. He was second in command at the [[Battle of Multan|capture of Multan]] and then joined the main army with his force for the [[battle of Gujrat]].

He returned to England in 1850 and became 3rd Viscount Melville on his father&amp;apos;s death in 1851. He continued his military career in Scotland from 1856 to 1860, in which year he was made governor of Edinburgh Castle. He was raised to the rank of general in 1868 and awarded the [[Order of the Bath]] in 1870.

He died unmarried at Melville Castle, near Edinburgh in 1876. His younger brother, [[Richard Saunders Dundas]] was a prominent naval officer.
