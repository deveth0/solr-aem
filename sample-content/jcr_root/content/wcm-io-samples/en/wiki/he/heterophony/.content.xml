In [[music]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;heterophony&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a type of [[texture (music)|texture]] characterized by the simultaneous [[variation (music)|variation]] of a single [[melody|melodic]] line. Such a texture can be regarded as a kind of complex [[monophony]] in which there is only one basic melody, but realized at the same time in multiple [[voice (polyphony)|voices]], each of which plays the melody differently, either in a different [[rhythm]] or [[tempo]], or with various embellishments and elaborations.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The term (coined by [[Archilochus]]{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}) was initially introduced into systematic [[musicology]] to denote a subcategory of  [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music, though is now regarded as a textural category in its own right.

Heterophony is often a characteristic feature of non-[[Western culture|Western]] traditional musics—for example [[Arabic classical music]], [[Japan]]ese [[Gagaku]], the [[gamelan music]] of [[Indonesia]], [[kulintang]] ensembles of the [[Philippines]]  and the traditional music of [[Thailand]]. A remarkably vigorous [[Europe]]an tradition of heterophonic music exists, however, in the form of [[Outer Hebrides|Outer Hebridean]] [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] psalmody.

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;[[Thai music]] is nonharmonic, melodic, or linear, and as is the case with all musics of this genre, its fundamental organization is horizontal... Thai music in its horizontal complex is made up of a main melody played simultaneously with variants of it which progress in relatively slower and faster rhythmic units... Individual lines of melody and variants sound in unison or octaves only at specific structural points, and the simultaneity of different pitches does not follow the Western system of organized chord progressions. Between the structural points where the pitches coincide (unison or octaves) each individual line follows the style idiomatic for the instrument playing it. The vertical complex at any given intermediary point follows no set progression; the linear adherence to style regulates. Thus several pitches that often create a highly complex simultaneous structure may occur at any point between the structural pitches. The music &amp;apos;breathes&amp;apos; by contracting to one pitch, then expanding to a wide variety of pitches, then contracting again to another structural pitch, and so on throughout. Though these complexes of pitches between structural points may strike the Western listener as arbitrary and inconsequential, the individual lines are highly consequential and logical &amp;apos;&amp;apos;linearly&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The pattern of pitches occurring at these structural points is the basis of the modal aspect of Thai music.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Morton, David (1976). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Traditional Music of Thailand&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p.21. University of California Press. ISBN 0-520-01876-1.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;heterophony&amp;apos;&amp;apos; may not clearly describe the phenomena involved, and the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;polyphonic stratification&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is suggested instead:

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;quot;The technique of combining simultaneously one main melody and its variants is often incorrectly described as heterophony: polyphonic stratification seems a more precise description, since each of the &amp;apos;layers&amp;apos; is not just a close approximation of the main melody, but also has distinct characteristics and a style of its own&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Morton (1964), p.39.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

Heterophony is somewhat rare in [[Western World|Western]] [[Classical Music|Classical]] music prior to the twentieth century, but is frequently encountered in the music of early [[Modernism (music)|modernist]] composers such as [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[George Enescu|Enescu]] and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], who were directly influenced by non-Western (and largely heterophonic) musics.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Heterophony is a standard technique in the music of the post-war avant-garde, however - for example [[Olivier Messiaen]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sept Haïkaï]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1962), and [[Harrison Birtwistle]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pulse Shadows]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1989-96).{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Other examples include [[Pierre Boulez]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Rituel]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Répons]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[…explosante-fixe…]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Campbell, Edward (2010). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boulez, Music and Philosophy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p.211&amp;amp;213. ISBN 978-0-521-86242-4.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Benjamin Britten]] used it to great effect in many of his compositions, including parts of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[War Requiem]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and especially his three Church Parables: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Curlew River]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Burning Fiery Furnace]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Prodigal Son (Britten)|The Prodigal Son]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}
