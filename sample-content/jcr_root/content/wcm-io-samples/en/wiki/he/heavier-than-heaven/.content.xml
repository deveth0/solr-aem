&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Heavier Than Heaven&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the name of a 2001 biography of musician [[Kurt Cobain]], the frontman of the [[grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].  It was written by [[Charles R. Cross]].

For the book, Cross desired to create the definitive Cobain biography, and over four years conducted 400+ interviews; in particular, he was granted exclusive interviews and access to Cobain&amp;apos;s private journals, lyrics and photos, by his widow [[Courtney Love]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hyperionbooks.com/titlepage.asp?ISBN=0786884029| title=Heavier than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain| publisher=HyperionBooks.com}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Notably, neither Nirvana drummer [[Dave Grohl]] nor Cobain&amp;apos;s mother contributed to the book.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;vanHorn, Terri. [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1448769/20010910/nirvana.jhtml &amp;quot;Cobain Book Shows Singer&amp;apos;s Life &amp;apos;Heavier&amp;apos; Than Most Imagined&amp;quot;].  MTVNews.com.  September 10, 2001.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Cross took the name &amp;quot;Heavier Than Heaven&amp;quot; from a tour Nirvana did with the band [[Tad (band)|Tad]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The lead singer, Tad Doyle, was very obese; the name which was thought up by the tour promoters, was meant in part to poke fun at the inaccurate idea that Tad alone weighed more than all of the members of Nirvana put together.
==Criticism==
While arguably the most complete Cobain biography, Cross opted to include his own impression of what Cobain&amp;apos;s final days were like. Several people questioned the inclusion of fiction in what was claimed to be a non-fiction book.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Furth, Charles. [http://www.livenirvana.com/official/hthrev.html &amp;quot;A Review: Heavier Than Heaven - The Biography of Kurt Cobain&amp;quot;]. LiveNirvana.com.  January 14, 2003.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; At the same time, Cross&amp;apos; desire for the book to be as complete as possible meant that he occasionally accepted secondhand (and incorrect) information as fact.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nirvana: the True Story&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Everett True]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The book was criticized as being a collaboration between Love and Cross by friends. Cross also did not interview Nirvana drummer [[Dave Grohl]]. However, beyond the criticism, the book contained many details about Cobain and Nirvana&amp;apos;s career that had otherwise gone unnoted.

==The book as property==
[[David Benioff]] was hired by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] in October 2007 to write a screenplay based on the Charles R. Cross biography. [[Courtney Love]] will serve as executive producer with [[Marc Forster]] showing interest in directing.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://theplaylist.blogspot.com/2009/02/marc-forster-to-direct-kurt-cobain.html Marc Forster To Direct Kurt Cobain Biopic?]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
