&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Heimrad Prem&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (27 May 1934 – 19 Februsry 1978) was a [[Germany|German]] painter born in [[Roding, Germany|Roding]], [[Oberpfalz]]. From 1949 - 1952 he studied decorative painting at [[Schwandorf]] and then studied painting with [[Josef Oberberger]] and  sculpture with [[Toni Stadler]] at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Akademie der Bildenden Künste]], [[Munich]] until 1956. While studying painting with [[Ernst Schumacher]] at the [[Hochschule der Künste]], [[Berlin]], he formed [[Gruppe SPUR]] with [[Lothar Fischer]], [[Helmut Sturm]], and [[Hans-Peter Zimmer]]. After meeting [[Asger Jorn]], SPUR joined the [[Situationist International]].

In 1960 he won a scholarship of the Kulturpreises im Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie, [[Cologne]]. From 1960 - 1962 he co-edited the magazine &amp;apos;&amp;apos;SPUR&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 1961 he visited [[Oerkelljunga]], [[Sweden]] with Sturm, Zimmer and [[Dieter Kunzelmann]] staying with [[Jørgen Nash]]. In 1962 the SPUR group was expelled from the [[Situationist International]], but they continued to work with Nash and others. In 1963 he worked on the SPUR collaborative  works: &amp;quot;Canale Grande Crescente&amp;quot; for the exhibition &amp;quot;Visione e Colore&amp;quot; in the Palazzo Grassi, [[Venice]], the SPUR-Bau joint contribution to the exhibition &amp;quot;Nouveaux Espaces&amp;quot;, Biennale Paris, and the &amp;quot;SPUR room&amp;quot; in the country house of Willi Bleicher with Munich.

His first solo exhibition in the [[Galerie van de Loo]], [[Munich]] was also in 1963. In 1965 the group SPUR fused with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wir&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to form the group &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Geflecht&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Network). After a short stay in South Sweden, Prem organised the organization of &amp;quot;white celebration&amp;quot; near Munich and began to paint under the influence of drugs.

After his first suicide attempt in 1971 he traveled in [[Italy]], [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]]. In 1975 he became a joint founder of the artists&amp;apos; community &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kollektiv Herzogstrasse&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He became a lecturer at the winter academy in the Schloss Kißlegg. In 1976 he had a special exhibition at the [[Haus der Kunst]], Munich. The following year he exhibited in [[Copenhagen]].

Following this, he continued to exhibit work mainly in [[Germany]].
