&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Henryk Zygalski&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-pol|ˈxɛnrɨk zɨˈɡalski|-|Zygalski.ogg}}; 15 July 1908, [[Poznań]] – 30 August 1978, [[Liss]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[mathematician]] and [[cryptologist]] who worked at breaking German [[Enigma machine|Enigma ciphers]] before and during [[World War II]].

==Life==
Zygalski was, from September 1932, a civilian [[cryptology|cryptologist]] with the [[Poland|Polish]] [[General Staff]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Biuro Szyfrów]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Cipher Bureau), housed in the [[Pałac Saski|Saxon Palace]] in [[Warsaw]].  He worked there with fellow [[Poznan University|Poznań University]] alumni and Cipher Bureau cryptology-course graduates [[Marian Rejewski]] and [[Jerzy Różycki]]. Together they developed methods and equipment for breaking Enigma messages.

In late 1938, in response to growing complexities in German encryption procedures, Zygalski designed the &amp;quot;[[Zygalski sheets|perforated sheets]],&amp;quot; also known as &amp;quot;[[Zygalski sheets]],&amp;quot; a manual device for finding Enigma settings. This scheme, like the earlier &amp;quot;[[card catalog]],&amp;quot; was independent of the number of connections being used in the Enigma&amp;apos;s plugboard, or commutator.

After the war he remained in exile in the [[United Kingdom]] and worked, until his retirement, as a lecturer in mathematical statistics at the [[University of Surrey]]. During this period he was prevented by the [[Official Secrets Act]] from speaking of his achievements in [[cryptology]].

He died August 30, 1978, at [[Liss]], was cremated and his ashes taken to [[London]].

==Honors==
Shortly before his death, he was honored by the [[Polish University in Exile]] with an honorary doctorate for his role in breaking Enigma.
