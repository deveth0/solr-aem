&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Heather Renee French Henry&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born December 29, 1974) is an [[United States|American]] [[Miss America]] title holder, [[Celebrity|personality]] and [[fashion designer]].

Raised in [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]], [[Kentucky]], Heather French Henry graduated from the [[University of Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning]]. She competed in pageants through her teens, including the Miss Ohio pageant.  She competed in the Miss Kentucky Pageant four times before winning the title on her fifth attempt in 1999.  She won the 2000 [[Miss America]] pageant in September 1999, the first Kentuckian to do so.  Her platform for her reign was raising awareness of [[homeless veterans]]; her father was a wounded veteran of the [[Vietnam War]].  She has received numerous awards for her work with veterans.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.missamerica.org/our-miss-americas/2000/2000.aspx Miss America--Heather French bio]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In October 2003, French Henry struck and subsequently killed Karola Stede, 44, a native of Germany and mother of four who was crossing against the traffic light in a Louisville intersection.
