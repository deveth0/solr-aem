&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Heusden-Zolder&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[municipality]] located in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] province of [[Limburg (Belgium)|province of Limburg]] near [[Hasselt]]. On 1 January 2006 Heusden-Zolder had a total population of 30,769. The total area is 53.23 km² which gives a [[population density]] of 578 inhabitants per km².

Heusden-Zolder was the result of the merger on 1 January 1977 of the two former municipalities of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Heusden&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zolder&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and currently consists of the former Heusden parishes of Heusden centre, Berkenbos and [[Eversel]], and the former Zolder parishes of Zolder centre, [[Boekt]], Viversel, Bolderberg and Lindeman.

Heusden-Zolder is home to almost 2,000 [[Immigration|immigrants]] from all over the world. This is due to the (now closed) coal mine of Zolder. During the 1960s Belgian coal mines faced an enormous shortage of employees. To address this problem, foreigner labourers were encouraged to immigrate and work near the mines. After their closure (the mine in Zolder was the last one in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxemburg to close in 1992) most of the immigrants chose to stay, which makes Heusden-Zolder a relatively [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] place.

==Local infrastructure==

The town hall, a large glass construction, is located in Zolder centre since the merger. As a compromise, the former town hall of Heusden is now used instead by the local [[social security]] department ([[Public Centre for Social Welfare|OCMW]]).

Heusden-Zolder has one hospital, the Sint-Franciskushospital, and one secondary school, the Sint-Franciscuscollege. The latter is split into two divisions: one in Heusden centre and one in Berkenbos. Heusden-Zolder also has a railway station, called &amp;quot;Zolder station&amp;quot;.
Heusden-Zolder is also accessible via the [[Albert Canal]] and the highway [[European route E314|E314]].
