&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herbert Karl Johannes Seifert&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (May 27, 1907, [[Bernstadt auf dem Eigen|Bernstadt]] – October 1, 1996, [[Heidelberg]]) was a [[Germans|German]] [[mathematician]] known for his work in [[topology]].

He was born in Bernstadt auf dem Eigen, but soon moved to [[Bautzen]], where he attended primary school at the Knabenbürgerschule, and secondary school at the Oberrealschule.

In 1926 Seifert entered the [[Technische Universität Dresden|Dresden University of Technology]].  The next year he attended a course on [[topology]] given by [[William Threlfall]].  This would be the beginning both of his lifelong work in the subject and his friendship with Threlfall.  In the year 1928-29 he visited the [[University of Göttingen]], where topologists such as [[Pavel Sergeevich Alexandrov]] and [[Heinz Hopf]] were working.

In 1930 he received his doctorate.  He then moved to the [[University of Leipzig]], where he received his second doctorate in 1932. It was here that Seifert submitted his dissertation, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Topologie 3-dimensionaler gefaserter Räume&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (“Topology of 3-dimensional fibred spaces”), on 1 February 1932, and he was awarded with this doctorate of philosophy after his oral examination on March 3. The [[manifold]]s he studied in his thesis were afterwards named [[Seifert fiber space]]s.

Seifert continued to collaborate with Threlfall, and in 1934 (the year Seifert received his habilitation) they published their &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Lehrbuch der Topologie]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  In 1938 they published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Variationsrechnung im Grossen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|author=Myers, S. B.|authorlink=Sumner Byron Myers|title=Review: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Variationsrechnung im Grossen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theorie der Marston Morse&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) by H. Seifert and W. Threlfall|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1940|volume=46|issue=5|page=390|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1940-46-05/S0002-9904-1940-07208-8/S0002-9904-1940-07208-8.pdf}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1935, Seifert was  summoned to a post at the [[University of Heidelberg]], where he took a position vacated by the dismissal of a Jewish professor.  During [[World War II]] he volunteered for a position at a [[Luftwaffe]] research center, the Institut für Gasdynamik.  After the war, Seifert was one of the few German professors whom the allies trusted during the period of [[denazification]].

In the year 1948-49 Seifert visited the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. On 13 September 1949, soon after returning to Germany, he married Katharina Korn.

Seifert retired in 1975. His students include [[Albrecht Dold]], [[Dieter Puppe]], and [[Horst Schubert]].
