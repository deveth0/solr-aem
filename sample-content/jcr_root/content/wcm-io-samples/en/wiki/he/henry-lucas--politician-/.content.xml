The Reverend &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Henry Lucas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (c. 1610 – July 1663) was  an English clergyman and politician who sat in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] from 1640 to 1648.

==Life==

Lucas was a student at [[St John&amp;apos;s College, Cambridge]]. He became secretary to [[Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland]].&amp;lt;ref name=Venn&amp;gt;{{Venn|id=LCS635H|name=Lucas, Henry}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In April 1640, he was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]] in the [[Short Parliament]]. He was re-elected MP for Cambridge University for the [[Long Parliament]] in November 1640.&amp;lt;ref name=Willis&amp;gt;{{Cite Notitia Parliamentaria|converted=1|part=2|pages=229–239}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was excluded from parliament in 1648 under [[Pride&amp;apos;s Purge]].

Lucas died unmarried in [[Chancery Lane]], [[London]], and was buried in [[Temple Church]] on 22 July 1663.&amp;lt;ref name=Venn/&amp;gt; He is now mainly remembered as a benefactor.

==Bequest==
[[Image:LucasArms.png||thumbnail|120px|right|Coat of Arms used at Lucas Hospital]]In his will, Lucas founded the Henry Lucas Charity with a bequest of £7,000, to be spent on building an [[almshouse]] for poor old men and on employing a chaplain as its Master.  The men were to be chosen from the poorest inhabitants of the Forest Division of [[Berkshire]] and the Bailiwick of [[Surrey]] in or near the Forest.  The original Hospital was built by Lucas’s executors on 1.5 acres (6,000&amp;amp;nbsp;m²) of land in [[Wokingham]] in 1666. On the death of the executors in 1675, the [[Drapers&amp;apos; Company]] of the [[City of London]] inherited the [[Trust law|trust]]eeship of the Hospital.  In 1923 an [[Act of Parliament]] dissolved the ancient Corporation, and provided for the admission of married couples, and for the employment of a Matron.

By 1999 the original building was no longer suitable for use as a modern almshouse.  The original Hospital was sold, and in July 2002, the Henry Lucas Charity was merged with the Whiteley Homes Trust. Sixteen double cottages were built in [[Whiteley Village]] near [[Walton-on-Thames]] in Surrey to provide accommodation for more than twice as many people as was possible in the Hospital, and are known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Henry Lucas Cottages&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The Drapers used a [[coat of arms]] to commemorate Lucas on the Henry Lucas Cottages at Whiteley Village, copying that on Lucas Hospital.  This can be described as: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quarterly with a crescent for difference on the fess point:  1 and 4, Argent, a fesse between six annulets gules;  2 and 3, Gules, on a bend argent, seven billets one two one two and one palewise of the bend sable&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a quartering of the Lucas and Morieux families&amp;apos; coats of arms.

Lucas also bequeathed his collection of 4,000 books (including [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dialogo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of 1632) to the [[Cambridge University Library|University Library]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], along with enough land to give an income of £100 a year, which was to be used to fund a professorship of &amp;quot;mathematick&amp;quot; (now the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics]]).
