[[Image:1stMarquessOfDorchester.jpg|thumb|right|Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester.]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (March 1606 &amp;amp;ndash; 8 December 1680) was an [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[Peerage|peer]], the son of the [[Robert Pierrepont, 1st Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull]].

==Career==

Styled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscount Newark&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from 1628, he was [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Nottingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Nottingham]] from 1628 until 1629, and was summoned to the [[House of Lords]] in his father&amp;apos;s Barony of Pierrepont in 1641. He succeeded his father as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;2nd Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1643.

During the earlier part of the [[English Civil War]] he was at [[Oxford]] in attendance upon the King, whom he represented at the negotiations at [[Uxbridge]]. In 1645 he was made a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]] and created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marquess of Dorchester&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; but in 1647 he compounded for his estates by paying a large fine to the [[Parliament of England|parliamentarians]]. Afterwards, Lord Dorchester, who was always fond of books, spent his time mainly in [[London]] engaged in the study of [[medicine]] and [[law]], his devotion to the former science bringing upon him a certain amount of ridicule and abuse. His collection of books is now part of the library of the [[Royal College of Physicians]].

After the Restoration he was restored to the Privy Council, and was made [[Recorder of Nottingham]] and a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].

==Marriages and children==

He married first Cecilia Bayning, a daughter of [[Paul Bayning, 1st Viscount Bayning]]. They had four children:
*Lady Anne Pierrepont (born 9 March 1630). Married [[John Manners, 1st Duke of Rutland]].
*Grace Pierrepont.
*Henry Pierrepont (d. 1649).
*Robert Pierrepont.

He was secondly married to Lady Catherine Stanley, a daughter of [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby]] and [[Charlotte Stanley, Countess of Derby]]. This marriage was childless.

Dorchester survived his sons and when he died in London on 8 December 1680 the Marquessate of Dorchester became extinct. He was succeeded as 3rd Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull by Robert (d. 1682), a son of Robert Pierrepont of Thoresby, Nottinghamshire, and as 4th Earl by Robert&amp;apos;s brother William (d. 1690).
