&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herbert Lange&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (September 29, 1909 - April 20, 1945) was a [[Sturmbannführer]] (Major) in the [[SS]], the commandant of [[Chełmno extermination camp]] until April 1942; leader of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;SS Special Detachment Lange&amp;apos;&amp;apos; conducting the extermination of Jews from the [[Łódź Ghetto]].  He was responsible for numerous crimes against humanity including the murder of mental patients in Poland and in Germany during the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Euthanasia Aktion&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of mid-1940.

== Background ==
Born in Menzlin village near [[Anklam]], [[Western Pomerania]], Lange studied law, but failed to obtain a degree and he subsequently joined the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP (Nazi Party)]] on May 1, 1932. He enlisted in the [[Sturmabteilung|Sturmabteilung (SA)]] three months later, and the following year, he joined the [[SS]]. He subsequently joined the police force, becoming a deputy commissioner in 1935.

== Crimes against humanity ==
On November 9, 1939, Lange was promoted to the rank of SS-[[Untersturmführer]] (2nd Lieutenant) and posted in [[Poland]] in charge of [[Poznań|Posen]] [[Gestapo]].&amp;lt;ref name=F138&amp;gt;Friedlander, p. 138.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In the beginning of 1940 he assumed command of a [[Sonderkommando]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kommando Lange&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) tasked with extermination of mentally ill in [[Wartheland]] area.&amp;lt;ref name=F1389&amp;gt;Friedlander, pp. 138-139.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The unit, equipped with [[gas van]]s, shuttled between hospitals, picking up patients and killing them with [[carbon monoxide]].&amp;lt;ref name=F139&amp;gt;Friedlander, p. 139.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

After his promotion to SS-[[Obersturmführer]] (1st Lieutenant) on April 20, 1940, his unit was permanently stationed at the [[Soldau concentration camp]]. In one particular case, [[Wilhelm Rediess]] hired &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kommando Lange&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to kill 1558 mental patients in [[East Prussia]] for ten [[German Reichsmark|Reichsmark]] a head.&amp;lt;ref name=F1394&amp;gt;Friedlander, pp. 139-140. Rediess denied payment and left for Norway; legalese correspondence between Lange&amp;apos;s superiors and Rediess continued for a whole year.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In the end of 1941 Lange was appointed chief of the [[Chełmno extermination camp]].

In 1942, Lange&amp;apos;s services were needed at the Reich Main Security Office (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and he was transferred. He served under [[Arthur Nebe]] as a Kriminalrat (Criminal Investigator) and in 1944, he aided in catching the conspirators of the attempt on [[Hitler]]&amp;apos;s life (the [[July 20 Plot]]), leading to his promotion to SS-Sturmbannführer.

Lange was killed in action during the [[Battle of Berlin]].{{Citation needed|date = July 2010}}
