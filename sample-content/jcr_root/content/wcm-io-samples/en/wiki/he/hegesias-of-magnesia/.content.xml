        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hegesias of Magnesia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Magnesia ad Sipylum, on the plains of [[Lydia]].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; ({{lang-grc|Ἡγησίας ὁ Μάγνης}}) (in [[Lydia]]), [[Greeks|Greek]] [[rhetoric]]ian, and historian, flourished about 300 BC. [[Strabo]] (xiv. 648), speaks of him as the founder of the florid [[Asiatic style]] of composition.

[[Agatharchides]], [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;De compositione verborum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924026465165#page/n109/mode/2up 18]) and [[Cicero]] all speak of him in disparaging terms, although [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] seems to have approved of his work. He professed to imitate the simplest style of [[Lysias]], avoiding long periods, and expressing himself in short, jerky sentences, without modulation or finish. His vulgar affectation and bombast made his writings a mere caricature of the old [[Attic]]. Dionysius describes his composition as tinselled, ignoble and effeminate. According to Gualtiero Calboli, Hegesias and his fellow Asiatics rejected Attic examples (and in particular the example of [[Thucydides]]) in favor of a return to &amp;quot;the models of Ionic and [[sophist]]ic prose.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Roberto Nicolai, &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ktêma es aei&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: Aspects of the Reception of Thucydides in the Ancient World,&amp;quot; in Jeffrey Rusten (ed.) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thucydides: Oxford Readings in Classical Studies&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [http://books.google.com/books?id=XFPghh2u-z0C&amp;amp;lpg=PA386&amp;amp;dq=hegesias%20rusten&amp;amp;pg=PA386#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false p. 386]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

It is generally supposed, from the fragment quoted as a specimen by Dionysius (and cf. [[Plutarch]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Life of Alexander&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/3.html#3.6 3]), that Hegesias is to be classed among the writers of lives of [[Alexander the Great]]. This fragment describes the treatment of [[Gaza]] and its inhabitants by Alexander after its conquest, but it is possible that it is only part of an epideictic or show-speech, not of an historical work. This view is supported by a remark of Agatharchides in [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] (cod. 250) that the only aim of Hegesias was to exhibit his skill in describing sensational events.
