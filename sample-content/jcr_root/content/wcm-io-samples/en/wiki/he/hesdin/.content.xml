&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hesdin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] [[Departments of France|department]] in northern [[France]].

==Geography==
The N39, from  [[Arras]] to [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil]], used to be the main thoroughfare of the town. In the 1950s, a circular route was created to help traffic flow. A second bypass was built in the 1980s, taking all through traffic well away from the town centre.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
The [[Canche]] river flows through the centre of Hesdin.

==History==
Hesdin was a fief of the [[counts of Artois]], vassals of the [[Count of Flanders|Counts of Flanders]] until 1180. When [[Philip I, Count of Flanders|Philip, count of Flanders]] gave [[Artois]] as dowry to his niece [[Isabella of Hainault]] when she married [[Philip Augustus of France]] in 1180, Hesdin and the other seigneuries passed to France. Though subsequently the territory passed to the [[Dukes of Burgundy]], Hesdin remained one of a handful of French strongholds, until in 1553 [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V|Emperor Charles V]] ordered the utter destruction of the old fortified town on a rise of ground and built the present town the following year, some {{convert|6|km|mi}} from the original site, on the banks of the Canche.

In 1639 the French laid [[siege]] to Hesdin and under [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], it was recaptured for France. Thus, though Hesdin has an ancient name and 16th century structures, there is nothing left of the medieval town.

The most recent and resourceful book on the history of Hesdin is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Promenades dans Hesdin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by  Regis Deparis (2004) {{Fr}}
