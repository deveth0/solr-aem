&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hella&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small town in the southern part of [[Iceland]] at the shores of the river [[Ytri-Rangá]] and has, as of 2011, 781 inhabitants.

Hella is situated {{Convert|94|km}} to the east of [[Reykjavík]] on the [[hringvegur]] (Road no.1) between [[Selfoss (town)|Selfoss]] and [[Hvolsvöllur]].

==Overview==
The name of the town comes from caves near the river. It is said that [[Ireland|Irish]] [[monk]]s lived there in the times of first settlement. There are small industries as well as shops. As in other regions of the country, tourism is a growing sector. The [[volcano]] [[Hekla]] is nearby so it is possible to go hiking there as well as to make excursions to other tourist attractions such as [[Landmannalaugar]] or [[Þórsmörk]].The founding of Hella started in 1927 when Þorsteinn Björnsson built a store over by the bridge Ytri-Rangá in the land of Gaddstaðaflatir. That founder of Hella was built a memorial at the celebration of Hella&amp;apos;s 50 years since the founding of it at 1977
