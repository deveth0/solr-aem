&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Heliozoa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are [[phagotroph]]s.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;pmid17588778&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal |author=Cavalier-Smith T, von der Heyden S |title=Molecular phylogeny, scale evolution and taxonomy of centrohelid heliozoa |journal=Mol.

These give them the characteristic sun-like appearance for which they are named, and are variously used for capturing food, sensation, movement, and attachment.  They are similar to [[radiolaria]], but they are distinguished from them by lacking central capsules and other complex skeletal elements, although some produce simple scales and spines.  They may be found in both fresh water and marine environments.

==Groups==
Originally the heliozoa were treated together as a formal class Heliozoa or Heliozoea, but it has been realised that they are [[polyphyletic]], as the various orders show notable differences and are no longer believed to be related. Instead, heliozoa is regarded as a descriptive term applying to various lines of protists.

The primary groups include:&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;pmid15148395&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal |author=Nikolaev SI, Berney C, Fahrni JF, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;et al&amp;apos;&amp;apos; |title=The twilight of Heliozoa and rise of Rhizaria, an emerging supergroup of amoeboid eukaryotes |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=101 |issue=21 |pages=8066–71 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15148395 |pmc=419558 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0308602101 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;amp;pmid=15148395}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

* [[Actinophryida]] (currently in [[Chromalveolata]])
* [[Centrohelida]] (some support for [[Hacrobia]])
* [[Desmothoracida]], [[Heliomonadida]] and [[Gymnosphaerida]] (currently in [[Rhizaria]] &amp;gt; [[Cercozoa]])
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sticholonche]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (currently in [[Rhizaria]] &amp;gt; [[Radiozoa]])

Several [[nucleariid]]s were once considered heliozoa, but they do not have microtubule-supported axopods and so are now considered filose amoeboids instead.
