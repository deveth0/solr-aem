[[File:Henry Art Gallery 01.jpg|thumb|Henry Art Gallery on the University of Washington campus]]
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Henry Art Gallery&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Henry&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;) is the [[art museum]] of the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], USA. Located on the west edge of the university&amp;apos;s campus along 15th Avenue N.E. in the [[University District, Seattle, Washington|University District]], it was founded in 1927 and was the first public art museum in the state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. The original building was designed by [[Bebb and Gould]].  It was expanded in 1997 to {{convert|40000|sqft|m2}}, at which time the 154-seat [[auditorium]] was added.  The addition/expansion was designed by [[Gwathmey Siegel &amp;amp; Associates Architects]].

==Founder==
The museum was named for [[Horace Chapin Henry|Horace C. Henry]], the local businessman who donated money for its founding, as well as a collection of paintings. Some years prior, Henry had added gallery space to his own home on [[Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington|Capitol Hill]], and from 1917 until the foundation of the Henry Gallery, he effectively operated a wing of his home as a free museum, open to the public 10 hours a week. In contrast to [[Charles Frye|Charles]] and [[Emma Frye|Emma]] Frye of Seattle&amp;apos;s [[Frye Art Museum]], Henry made no effort to control the future of the museum he financed; indeed, he specifically disavowed any such intention.&amp;lt;ref name=Graves&amp;gt;{{cite news|author=Jen Graves|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=445293|title=The Pepsi Challenge: The Henry&amp;apos;s and the Frye&amp;apos;s Original Collections Together for the First Time: Can You Guess Who Collected What?|publisher=&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|date=November 22, 2007|page=29|accessdate=2007-12-06}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Exhibitions==
The Henry&amp;apos;s exhibition program is largely devoted to contemporary art and the history of photography. Recent exhibitions include solo exhibitions by [[Maya Lin]] (2006), [[Lynn Hershman Leeson]] (2005–06), [[Doug Aitken]] (2005), [[Axel Lieber]] (2004–05), and [[James Turrell]] (2003), and group exhibitions such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;W.O.W. - The Work of the Work&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 2004–05, which explored contemporary art&amp;apos;s appeal to non-visual senses and the body of the viewer.

==Collection==
The Henry&amp;apos;s collection includes over 20,000 objects.  The collection includes strong holdings in photography, both historical and contemporary, due to the partial gift and purchase of the Joseph and Elaine Monsen collection. In 1982 the Henry inherited a sizable collection from the University of Washington&amp;apos;s former Costume and Textile Study Center. The Henry also holds a [[James Turrell]] skyspace, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Light Reign&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which is illuminated at night by color-shifting [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] behind frosted glass. Like the [[Safeco Field|Seattle baseball stadium]], the skyspace has a retractable roof.

The Henry has made their collections available for research or general public interest by providing in-house and online public access though the Reed Collection Study Center, new online catalog, and in-house Digital Information Gallery (DIG). These resources allow students and the general public to more fully explore collections for personal or professional research. Though resources online offer general information, DIG provides access to images and data for over 24,000 objects in the collection and can help make better use of the Reed Collection Study Center. Objects in the collection can be accessed on-site, by reservation only, through the Reed Collection Study Center or academic classes, adult study groups, and researchers.
