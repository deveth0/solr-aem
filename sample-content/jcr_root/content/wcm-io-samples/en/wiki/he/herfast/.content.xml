&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herfast&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arfast&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (died 1085) was a medieval [[Lord Chancellor]] of England, [[Bishop of Elmham]] and [[Bishop of Thetford]].

==Life==
Born in [[Normandy]], he joined [[William the Conqueror]] during the [[Norman Conquest of England]], and was appointed head of the royal writing office after the [[Battle of Hastings]]. He was Lord Chancellor of England from 1068 to 1070.&amp;lt;ref name=Fryde81&amp;gt;{{cite book |author=Fryde, E. B. |coauthors=Greenway, D.

He signed the [[Accord of Winchester]] in 1072 and died in 1084.&amp;lt;ref name=BHONorwich&amp;gt;{{cite book |last=Greenway |first=Diana E. |year=1971 |title=Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066-1300 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33866 |volume=volume 2: Monastic cathedrals (northern and southern provinces) |pages=55–58}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was a married bishop, and his sons held land in Norfolk at the time of Domesday Book in 1086.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |author=Williams, Ann |title=The English and the Norman Conquest |publisher=Boydell Press |location=Ipswich |year=2000 |isbn=0-85115-708-4 |page=46}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
