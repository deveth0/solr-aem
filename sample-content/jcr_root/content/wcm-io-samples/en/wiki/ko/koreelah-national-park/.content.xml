&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Koreelah &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a national park in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], 631&amp;amp;nbsp;km north of [[Sydney]].  The park is part of the [[Scenic Rim]] [[Important Bird Area]], identified as such by [[BirdLife International]] because of its importance in the conservation of several species of [[threatened]] birds.&amp;lt;ref name=bli&amp;gt;BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Scenic Rim. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-10-03.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Description==
The main feature is the gorge just south west of the campsite.  At the head of the gorge is a deep water hole surrounded by four metre cliffs that can be dived from.  There are bigger waterfalls downstream but no access to the main gorge from the north without ropes.  There is some algae in the water if there has not been recent rain.

==Facilities==
There is a campsite signed west of White Swamp Road, roughly 10&amp;amp;nbsp;km north of Old Koreelah (which is on the Mount Lindsay Highway).  It has a compost toilet and some [[barbecue]]s, although the grass and weeds are rather long since cattle were evicted about 1999.
