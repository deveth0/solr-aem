The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Konsojaya Trading Company&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[shell (corporation)|shell company]] cofounded by [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] leader [[Riduan Isamuddin]], better known as &amp;quot;Hambali&amp;quot;, and his [[Malaysian Chinese]] wife, [[Noralwizah Lee Abdullah]] on June 1994. The company was based in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]].

An [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] named [[Wali Khan Amin Shah]] was one of the board of directors of the company. He also owned half (3,000) of the company&amp;apos;s 6,000 shares. Another member of the board of directors was Afghan [[Mehdat Abdul Salam Shabana]], who owned the other half of the company&amp;apos;s shares. Another member was 30-year old [[Hemeid H. Algamdi]], a citizen of [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. [[Yemen]]i [[Amein Mohamed]] was the managing director of Konsojaya. A company profile that was circulated to suppliers and customers stated that he was the former marketing director of a [[Pakistan]]-based supplying agent for a company in Jeddah.

Konsojaya stated in its incorporation papers that it was an &amp;quot;import/export&amp;quot; company that shipped [[palm oil]] to [[Afghanistan]] from [[Malaysia]]. The organization also dealt with the export of [[Sudan]]ese [[honey]]. Its &amp;quot;principal objective&amp;quot; was to import and export products found in the [[Asia]]/Pacific region ([[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Oceania]]) to Afghanistan, [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Bahrain]], and [[Sudan]].

A man named [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]], who was staying in [[Manila]],  [[Philippines]], often travelled to several places, including [[Brazil]], to promote Konsojaya.

Konsojaya actually funneled money and material assistance to several regional militant Islamic plots. The organization also funneled money to an account owned by [[Omar Abu Omar]], an employee of the [[International Relations and Information Centre]], an organization run by [[Mohammed Jamal Khalifa]], who is married to one of [[Osama bin Laden]]&amp;apos;s sisters. The money would then be siphoned into an account under the name of &amp;quot;Adam Salih&amp;quot;, an alias of [[Ramzi Yousef]], who was at the time planning [[Manila]]-based [[Operation Bojinka]], an attack that would have destroyed eleven airliners.

Manila police discovered Operation Bojinka after an apartment fire led police to a suspect on January 6 and the morning of January 7, 1995.

According to corporate records in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Konsojaya no longer exists.
