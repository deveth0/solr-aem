&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Koskenkorva Viina&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also known simply as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Koskenkorva&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kossu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is the most common clear spirit drink (38%) in [[Finland]], produced by [[Altia]] in the Koskenkorva distillery in [[Ilmajoki]] and bottled in [[Rajamäki]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Isola, S: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sauna, Grit, Guts &amp;amp; Kossu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p. 60-67, Welcome to Finland, Spring-Summer 2007&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The grain ([[barley]]) alcohol is produced using 200-step [[continuous distillation]] designed to produce high-purity industrial [[ethanol]]. The drink is produced by diluting this alcohol with spring water and a very small amount of [[sugar]]. Although commonly called a [[vodka]] in English, in Finland it is not called a &amp;quot;vodka&amp;quot;, but &amp;apos;&amp;apos;viina&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (see [[brännvin]]), although the word &amp;quot;vodka&amp;quot; is found in the label due to EU regulations.

Besides the standard 38% near-unflavored there are several variants of Koskenkorva on the market, most notably the famous [[Salmiakki Koskenkorva]], better known as Salmiakkikossu or Salmari, which is [[salmiakki]]-flavored. Another variant is the same Koskenkorva with [[rye]] instead of barley, marketed under the same concept as Koskenkorva Viina Ruis. There also exists a [[vanilla]] variant called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vanilja Koskenkorva&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Koskenkorva Vodka&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the same drink, but with 40% or 60% alcohol instead of the traditional 38%, as this brand is intended for foreign markets. [[Finlandia Vodka]], a vodka classified as &amp;quot;imported premium&amp;quot;, is the same as Koskenkorva 40%, except that sugar is not added. Altia sold this brand, intended for foreign markets, to the American [[Brown-Forman Corporation]], but remains the sole producer of Finlandia Vodka at least until 2017.

A new design for the Koskenkorva Viina bottle was introduced in 2008. It has a white label, with &amp;lt;small&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;KOSKENKORVA&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt; in black and &amp;lt;small&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;VODKA&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt; below in grey, and a drawing of a scenery of fields with barns on them in light brown. The product number in the Finnish [[Alko]], &amp;lt;small&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;013&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;, is prominently displayed. This design line goes through the whole range of products.

Kossu is at its best when cold, but can be also mixed for example with [[Vodka and Coke|Coke]] (which is then called &amp;quot;Kossukola&amp;quot;), with [[carbonated water]] (&amp;quot;Kossuvissy&amp;quot;), orange juice (&amp;quot;screwdriver&amp;quot;), energy drink (&amp;quot;Kossu Battery&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Virtanen&amp;quot;) or certain (hard) salty liquorice candies (Salmiakkikoskenkorva, Salmiakkikossu, Salmari). The last is often made by mixing ground [[Turkinpippuri]] (Turkish pepper) with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;kossu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, though other candies of similar type are also a possibility and there also exists a ready salmiakki [[Drink mixer|mixer]] for this particular purpose.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.kolumbus.fi/haganol/content-mix1.htm Apteekin salmiakki mixer]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Another way of enjoying &amp;apos;&amp;apos;kossu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which has gained popularity recently, is mixing ground [[Fisherman&amp;apos;s Friend]] lozenges to the drink. The resulting cocktail is known as &amp;quot;Fisu&amp;quot; ([[Helsinki slang]] for &amp;quot;fish&amp;quot;).

[[Altia]] is owned by the state of Finland. When the government considered selling the corporation, a popular movement grew to oppose this.

==Trivia==
* Koskenkorva is a small village – that belongs to municipality of [[Ilmajoki]] – in [[Finland]] that translates as &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;(area) by the rapids&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;. The [[folk etymology]] &amp;quot;rapid&amp;apos;s ear&amp;quot; is based on the fact that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;korva&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also means &amp;quot;ear&amp;quot;.
* The original name of the drink was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Koskenkorvan viina&amp;apos;&amp;apos; – notice the genitive &amp;apos;n&amp;apos; – &amp;quot;liquor of Koskenkorva&amp;quot;. The name was changed recently into &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Koskenkorva viina&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Koskenkorva liquor&amp;quot;. Furthermore, even older labels had the original name in the [[Partitive case|partitive]] as &amp;lt;small&amp;gt;KOSKENKORVAN VIINAA&amp;lt;/SMALL&amp;gt; &amp;quot;(some) liquor of Koskenkorva&amp;quot;.
* [[Irwin Goodman]]&amp;apos;s song repertoire included &amp;quot;Koskenkorvassa&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;In Koskenkorva&amp;quot;), where nearly every line is a [[double entendre]] interpretable as either praise to living in Koskenkorva village or being drunk of Koskenkorva Viina.
* In the song &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Land Of Ice And Snow&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Timo Kotipelto]], the vocalist of the Finnish heavy-metal band [[Stratovarius]], describes Finland as the land &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;where Koskenkorva flows&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
* The instrumental &amp;apos;&amp;apos;0132&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by also Finnish band [[Sentenced (band)|Sentenced]] was composed to allude the hazy feeling after drinking Koskenkorva. The name itself is the product code for the drink.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://mhs.fi/sentenced/?action=kysymykset&amp;amp;t=700&amp;amp;hakusana=&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
