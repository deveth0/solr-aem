&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kołbacz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-pl|&amp;apos;|k|o|ł|b|a|cz}} ({{lang-de|Kolbatz}}) is a [[village]] in the administrative district of [[Gmina Stare Czarnowo]], within [[Gryfino County]], [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship]], in north-western Poland.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;TERYT&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.gov.pl/broker/access/prefile/listPreFiles.jspa |title=Central Statistical Office (GUS) - TERYT (National Register of Territorial Land Apportionment Journal) |date=2008-06-01 |language=Polish}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It lies approximately {{convert|4|km|mi|0}} north-east of [[Stare Czarnowo]], {{convert|23|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Gryfino]], and {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south-east of the regional capital [[Szczecin]]. It is located on the Pyrzyce-Stargard Plains, on the west bank of the river [[Płonia]], and has roughly 1400 inhabitants.

The area has been inhabited since at least the times of the [[Lusatian culture]]. In 1173 it was donated to the [[Cistercian]] order (originally of [[Denmark]]). Between 1210 and 1347 a large monastery (Kołbacz Abbey) and several farms were built in the area to house the monks. In sources known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Colbatz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kolbatz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Colbas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, sometimes &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mera Vallis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which means &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bright Valley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. After the secularization of [[Pomerania]]n Cistercians in 1555 the area became a private property of the [[Duchy of Pomerania|Dukes of Pomerania-Stettin]], the monastery was converted into a castle and then into a summer residence of the dukes. The rulings of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) and the [[Treaty of Stettin (1653)]] assigned Kolbatz to [[Brandenburg]], which later became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Since 1815 it was within the [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Province of Pomerania]]. After 1945, it became part of Poland.

Among the most notable historical attractions are remnants of Cistercian [[abbey]], which include a Romanesque-Gothic church (1210–1347), one of the oldest brick churches in Pomerania. There are also remnants of the monastery itself, as well as a converts&amp;apos; house, abbot&amp;apos;s house, a gothic barn and a fortified tower.
