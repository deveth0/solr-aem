The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[National Wildlife Refuge|United States National Wildlife Refuge]] in the [[Kodiak Archipelago]] in southwestern [[Alaska]], [[United States]].

The Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge includes the southwestern two-thirds of [[Kodiak Island]], Uganik Island, the Red Peaks area of [[Afognak]] Island and all of Ban Island in the [[archipelago]]. It encompasses {{convert|1990418|acre|km2}}.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.fws.gov/refuges/land/LandReport.html USFWS Lands Report, 30 September 2007]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The refuge is administered from offices in [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]].

The refuge contains seven major rivers and about 100 streams. It is a [[spawn (biology)|spawning ground]] for all six species of [[Pacific Ocean]] [[salmon]], [[steelhead]], [[Dolly Varden trout|Dolly Varden]], and several other [[fish]] species; as well as a nesting ground for 250 species of bird, many of which feed on salmon. The refuge has only six native species of [[mammal]]s: [[Brown Bear|Kodiak brown bear]], [[red fox]], [[Northern River Otter|river otter]], [[ermine]], [[little brown bat]] and [[tundra vole]]. The non-native mammals [[Sitka black-tailed deer]], [[mountain goat]], [[Roosevelt elk]], [[feral reindeer]], [[marten]], [[red squirrel]], [[snowshoe hare]], and [[American Beaver|beaver]] were introduced to the archipelago between the 1920s and 1950s and are now hunted and trapped. An estimated 2,300 brown bears inhabit the refuge, and an estimated 1200 bald eagles nest here every year.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge|url=http://www.fws.gov/refuges/profiles/index.cfm?id=74530|publisher=U.S. Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife Service}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The climate of the refuge is that of southern Alaska, mild and rainy. Many areas in the refuge are densely forested with [[Sitka Spruce]] at lower elevations. There are [[grassland]]s in drier areas, shrub habitats dominated by dense [[alder]], and [[alpine]] habitats at higher elevations. The refuge contains several small [[glacier]]s.

The refuge has no road access from the outside but contains part of a private road used for access to the [[Terror Lake Hydroelectric Generating Station|Terror Lake hydroelectric facility]]. Public use of this road is prohibited.
