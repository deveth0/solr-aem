[[Image:PolandSzczecinUjejskiMonument.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Kornel Ujejski - monument in [[Szczecin]], [[Poland]] moved form [[Lwów]] in 1946]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kornel Ujejski&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (September 12, 1823 in Beremiany, [[Podole]] - September 19, 1897 in [[Pavliv, Radekhiv Raion|Pavliv]] near [[Lviv]]), also known as Cornelius Ujejski, was a [[Poland|Polish]] poet, patriot and political writer.

He was named &amp;quot;last of the greatest Polish poets of [[Romanticism in Poland|Romanticism]]&amp;quot;.

Ujejski was involved in Poland&amp;apos;s struggle for independence after [[partitions of Poland|it had been partitioned]] and erased from the map of Europe by neighbouring countries ([[Russian Empire]], [[Prussia]] and [[Austrian Empire]]). In 1846, at the instigation of the Austrian Government during the [[Kraków Uprising]], the Galician peasants massacred several thousand of the nobility. Ujejski then gave utterance to the universal feeling of indignation in his powerful poem &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Choral&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which has become one of the notable patriotic Polish songs of that period.

The political situation in partitioned Poland was reflected in his poems and political writing. His writing conveyed patriotic and historic message and was meant to support the Polish people in their fight for independence.
