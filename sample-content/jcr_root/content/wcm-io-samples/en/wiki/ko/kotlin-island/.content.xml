&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kotlin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or Kettle;  {{lang-fi|Retusaari}}) is a [[Russia]]n [[island]], located near the head of the [[Gulf of Finland]], {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Saint Petersburg]] in the [[Baltic Sea]]. Kotlin separates the [[Neva Bay]] from the rest of the gulf. The fortified town of [[Kronstadt]] is located on the island. The island serves as a gateway to Saint Petersburg and as such has been the site of several military engagements.

==History==
The town of Kronstadt was founded by Peter the Great, who took the island of Kotlin from the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1703. Kotlin was the site of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] in March of 1921 which resulted in over 11,000 casualties.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Pukhov, A. S. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kronshtadtskii miatezh v 1921 g.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Leningrad, OGIZ-Molodaia Gvardiia.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Orlando Figes, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A People&amp;apos;s Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (New York: Viking Press 1997), 767.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Geography==
In general outline, the island forms an elongated triangle, {{convert|7.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} in length by about {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} in breadth, with its base towards St Petersburg. The eastern or broad end is occupied by the town of Kronstadt, and [[shoal]]s extend for {{convert|1.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the western point of the island to the rock on which the Tolbaaken [[lighthouse]] is built.

The island thus divides the seaward approach to St Petersburg into two channels; that on the northern side is obstructed by shoals which extend across it from Kotlin to [[Lisiy Nos]]; the southern channel, the highway to the former capital, is narrowed by a spit which projects from opposite [[Lomonosov, Russia|Lomonosov]] on the Russian mainland, and, lying close to Kronstadt, has been historically strongly guarded by [[artillery battery|batteries]].

The naval approach to Saint Petersburg was greatly facilitated by the construction in 1875â€“85 of a [[canal]], {{convert|23|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep, through the shallows, whereas cars will soon be able to travel overland to the island by using the [[Saint Petersburg Dam]] from the north and south shores of the [[Gulf of Finland]]. Started in 1980, but delayed by political upheaval in the 1990s, the dam project was completed in 2010 and officially commissioned in 2011.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web| url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/08/12/54579666.html| title=St. Petersburg gets protecting dam| publisher=[[Voice of Russia]]| date= 12 August, 2011| accessdate=14 August, 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Pollution==
On November 15, 2000, a collision between two ships, a {{convert|67|m|ft|abbr=on}} refrigerator trawler named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nortlandia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and a {{convert|130|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Panama]]nian-registered cargo vessel named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;E.W. McKinley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Oil spill|spilled]] three tons of [[diesel fuel]] into the water off Kotlin Island. The smaller ship also sank as a result of the collision after sustaining [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] damage, and two crew members required treatment for [[hypothermia]]. The fuel slick covered {{convert|11|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of Kronstadt harbor. By that afternoon, divers had plugged the hole to prevent further leakage, and remediation efforts to contain and remove the spill were underway.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Titova, Irina. &amp;quot;[http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;amp;story_id=13318 Kronshtadt Collision Sinks Ship]&amp;quot;, The [[St. Petersburg Times]], published November 17, 2000, accessed March 11, 2007.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
