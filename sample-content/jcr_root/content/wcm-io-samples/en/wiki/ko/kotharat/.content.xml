The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kotharat&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kotharot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kathirat&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (various suggested pronunciations of [[Ugaritic]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;k&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;t&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;rt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), &amp;apos;the skilful ones&amp;apos; were a group of northwest [[Semitic]] goddesses appearing in the Ugartic texts as divine midwives. They are the only [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite deities]] that only appear in a group, and are [[anthropomorphism|associated]] with the [[swallow]].

In the story of [[Danel|Aqhat]] the chieftain [[Danel|Daniel]], in order to obtain a child, for seven days feasts the Kotharat who have entered his house. They are called:
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;the swallow-like daughters of the crescent moon,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
those [artful] in the pleasure of the bed of conception.&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
On the seventh day they depart. Daniel&amp;apos;s wife conceived.

In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nikkal and the Kotharat&amp;apos;&amp;apos; the Kotharat are first summoned to oversee the birth of a son to [[Yarikh]] the moon-god and the goddess [[Nikkal]] and then summoned a second time to bless the human girl Prbkht for her forthcoming marriage.

[[Sanchuniathon]] refers to a group of seven daughters of [[El (god)|El]] by [[Astarte|â€˜Ashtart]] whose [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] name is not given but who are called the Titanides or Artemides in [[Greek language|Greek]]. That the Greek goddess [[Artemis]] was often worshipped as a birth goddess suggests these seven Artemides are so called because they were also birth goddesses. If so, they are probably identical to the Ugaritic Kotharat.

The god [[Zedek|Sydyc]] or Sadyc fathers the god [[Eshmun]] (Greek [[Asclepius]]) on one of the Titanides/Artemides.
