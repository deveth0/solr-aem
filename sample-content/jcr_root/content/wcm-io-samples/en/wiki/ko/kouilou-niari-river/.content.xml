The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kouilou-Niari River&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;amp;nbsp;— also spelled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kwilu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kwila&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kwil&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;amp;nbsp;— is the most important river flowing to the Atlantic ocean of the Congo Coast. Moreover, it entire drainage area is completely in the [[Republic of the Congo]].  The river is called the Kouilou River while flowing in the coastal region of the Kouilou till the Sounda gorges. Upstream from the Gorges, its name is the [[Niari]] . The river combines with the [[Louessé River]], the [[Loudima]] and the [[Bouenza]] and eventually flows into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It covers about 560&amp;amp;nbsp;km from its origin in the [[plateaux batéké]] of The Congo to its mouth at the coast.

The river has numerous waterfalls and is impassable from its mouth, which is of difficult access by multiple [[shoal|sandbars]], formed primarily by the action of the [[Benguela current]].
The River is usable and boats are coming up to [[kakamoéka]]. from [[Kakamoéka]] to [[Sounda]], rapids and rocks are blocking access especially during dry season.
Very limited Traffic upstream Sounda as they are rapids and a few bridges.

Bridges on the River are located at [[Bas-Kouilou]], [[Sounda]], [[Kimbangou]], [[Makabana]], [[Loudima]] and [[Bouenza]].

The Kouilou part is fairly flat with the water level rising only 16 meters above Sea level on first 70&amp;amp;nbsp;km.
In the area of Kimbangou, the water level is around 60 meters above sea level and reaches 115 meters at the [[Loudima]] junction.

==List of waterfalls==
&amp;lt;!-- Only have one so far, but I don&amp;apos;t know of a better way to handle this; I don&amp;apos;t think that the emphasis on one waterfall is warranted so I&amp;apos;m lining it up to add more names &amp;amp; explanations if anyone can find them. --&amp;gt;
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Zrinski]] [[Zrinski chutes|chutes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: Honors [[Nikola Zrinski]] and [[Petar Zrinski]], [[Croatia]]n nobles; &amp;quot;discovered&amp;quot; and named in 1882 by a Croatian member ([[Dragutin Lerman]]) of [[Henry Morton Stanley]]&amp;apos;s exploration team. Local names, and local knowledge in general, are unfortunately ignored in such naming.

* Sounda gorges.
The gorges are remarkable with a small waterdrop of 2 meters and mountain around 120 meters high.
An old iron bridge is still usable in 2012 to cross the river in Sounda.
A road comes from the village of Mandzi south of Sounda while the road continues on north west toward [[Kakamoéka]], sous-prefectuure.
An abandoned track on the southern bank of the river reaches [[Kakamoéka]] which was created during the exploration for the train. The mission Jacob&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=French national library|url=Www.gallica.fr}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  was conducted in 1896.
The track wad reopened in 1954 for the evaluation of the hydro potential of the Sounda dam.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Institut de recherche et de developpement|url=Www.ird.com}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In Sounda, a large Hydro electrical project has been evaluated since the mid 50&amp;apos;s when France was looking at developing the region.
10 years of research have led to a tunnel built in the mountain, a bridge and a camp established on site.

In May 2011, a protocole d&amp;apos;accord has been signed with a South African Company [[IDG]] and the [[republic of Congo]] for the development of the Sounda dam project.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=IDG eyes Congo hydro dam|url=http://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-industrials/idg-eyes-congo-hydro-dam?sn=2009+Detail|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=9 may 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
IDG has teamed up with strategic partner [[African Power Corporation]] (APC).
The 2 companies have joined forces to lead the development of the project. Coming together with the potential users and financial institution to put the project on track for success.
Such a project is expected to help develop the country&amp;apos;s huge mineral potential.
In October 2012, APC increased their presence in the country and name a country representative.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=APC African Power Corporation -the team|url=http://www.africanpower.co.uk/about-us/team.aspx|accessdate=Oct 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Nicolas Rouzé has a great experience in the Congo as he has been in country since 1998. He is managing the efforts in Country to drive the project on the local scale.
