        text="&lt;p&gt;An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;opacifier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a substance added to a material in order to make the ensuing system [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]. An example of a chemical opacifier is [[tin dioxide]] (SnO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;), which is used to opacify [[ceramic glaze]]s&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.azom.com/details.asp?ArticleID=2358 Tin Oxide ( SnO2 ) Stannic Oxide – Properties and Applications], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The A to Z of Materials&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and [[milk glass]]; [[bone ash]] is also used.

Opacifiers must have a [[refractive index]] (RI) substantially different from the system. Conversely, clarity may be achieved in a system by choosing components with very similar refractive indices.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=Materials Science and Engineering: A First Course |last= Raghavan |first=V. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=[[India]] |isbn= 81-203-2455-2 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Opacifiers must also form small particles in the system. Opacifiers are generally [[inert]].

Sometimes opacifiers are added to medical implants to make them visible under [[X-ray]] imaging. This is especially true in the case of most [[polymer]]s which are often unrecognizable in the body when viewed using X-rays.

In [[solid rocket propellant]]s and some translucent [[smokeless powder]]s, the primary method of heat transfer into the propellant grain from the combustion process is by radiation, and opacifiers such as &amp;quot;[[lamp black]]&amp;quot; may be added to the propellant mixture to ensure the heat does not penetrate far below the surface of the grain, which could cause detonation. The opacifiers also prevent sub-surface overheating and localized premature ignition in the grains where imperfections absorbing the thermal radiation are present. [[Carbon black]] is commonly used for this purpose; other possible additives are [[nigrosin]], [[Prussian blue]], [[methylene blue]], etc. in amounts ranging commonly between 0.1–0.5%.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;US Army. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Encyclopedia of Explosives and Related Items&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, vol.8&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
