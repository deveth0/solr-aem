An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;operator-assisted&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; call is one in which the [[calling party]] places a [[telephone call]] which requires an [[Switchboard operator|operator]] to provide some form of assistance in completing the call.  This may include [[telephone]] calls made from [[pay phone]]s, calls placed station-to-station, person-to-person, [[collect call|collect]], [[third number call]]s, calls billed to a [[credit card]], and certain [[international call]]s which cannot be dialed directly.

Before the advent of [[emergency telephone number]]s, operators identified and connected emergency calls to the correct [[emergency service]].  [[Directory assistance]] was also part of the operator&amp;apos;s job.

Operator-assisted calls can be more expensive than [[direct dial]] calls.

A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;person-to-person call&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an operator-assisted call in which the calling party wants to speak to a specific party and not simply to anyone who answers.  The caller is not charged for the call unless the requested party can be reached.  This method was popular when telephone calls were relatively expensive.

An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;operator-assisted conference call&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or op assist call is one in which the [[conference call]] is managed by an operator. The telephone operator will greet each call participant, gather specific information from each participant, introduce key speakers, and manage questions and answers, all from the telephone.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Station-to-station&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a method of placing a telephone call, with or without assistance, in which the [[calling party]] agrees to talk to whoever answers the telephone.  With the introduction of [[direct dial]] telephone service and the subsequent drop in the price of [[long distance telephone call]]s, person-to-person service is virtually unheard of. [[Fax machines]] and [[modems]], due to their inability to ask for a party by name, use the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;station-to-station&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; technique.

A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;third number call&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;third party call&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an operator assisted telephone call that can be billed to the party other than the calling and called party. The operator calls the third number for the party to accept the charges before the call can proceed.
