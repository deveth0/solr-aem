The joint operation between Iraq and the United States, lasted approximately 16 hours, and was conducted on 2 December 2003. 1,200 soldiers from the [[173rd Airborne Brigade]], the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]], and Iraqi military participated. Operation Bayonet Lightning was concentrated on Al Hawija, Iraq, and the village of [[Rashad|Rashad, Iraq]], sixty kilometers, or thirty-seven miles, to the south of [[Kirkuk|Kirkuk, Iraq]].
