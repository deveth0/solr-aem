&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;OpenGL User Interface Library&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;GLUI&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[C++]] [[user interface]] library based on the [[OpenGL Utility Toolkit]] (GLUT) which provides controls such as buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, and spinners to OpenGL applications. It is window- and operating system independent, relying on GLUT to handle all system-dependent issues, such as window and mouse management.

It lacks the features of a more full-fledged GUI toolkit such as [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]], [[wxWidgets]], or [[FLTK]], but it has a very small footprint and is extremely easy to use.  A research or demonstration program that originally only uses GLUT can be given a useful control panel using GLUI in a short time, even by someone new to the toolkit.

It was first written by [[Paul Rademacher]] to help him with his academic work. It is now maintained by [[Nigel Stewart]].

Weaknesses include the lack of a properly functioning file chooser (perhaps the most frustrating omission) and mediocre responsiveness.
