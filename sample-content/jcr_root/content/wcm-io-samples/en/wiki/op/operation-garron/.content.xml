        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Operation Garron&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the codename that the [[United Kingdom]] has assigned to its [[military]] [[Humanitarian aid|relief]] operation in the aftermath of the devastating [[tsunami]] caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]].

==Initial response==

The first forces assigned were [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]]. An RAF [[C-17 Globemaster III]] [[Cargo aircraft|transport aircraft]] was assigned to the region along with the RN [[warship]] [[HMS Chatham (F87)|HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chatham&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], which left its station patrolling in the [[Persian Gulf]]. The [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] [[Ship|vessel]] [[RFA Diligence|RFA &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Diligence&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], present in [[Kochi, India|Kochi]], [[India]] when the disaster struck, replenished &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chatham&amp;apos;&amp;apos; before returning to Kochi to embark aid supplies. Royal Navy [[engineer]]s were also airlifted to the area to augment the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Diligence&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. After the port call it returned to the [[disaster]] area, to perform relief work with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chatham&amp;apos;&amp;apos; around the east [[coast]] of [[Sri Lanka]]. The embarked [[helicopter]]s on board the ships, including two [[Westland Lynx]] machines on board &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chatham&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, are also participating in the relief effort. Further RAF Globemaster, [[Lockheed L-1011|Tristar]] and [[C-130 Hercules|Hercules]] aircraft have flown in supplies. RAF personnel are operating in the city of [[Banda Aceh]], [[Indonesia]] in assistance of RAF and international relief flights there.

==Troop offer==

A [[Company (military unit)|company]] of a [[British Army]] [[Gurkha]] battalion stationed in [[Brunei]] and two accompying [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] helicopters was offered to the Indonesian [[government]] in January 2005 to aid in efforts on the island of [[Sumatra]]. However, Indonesia declined the Gurkha troops, and accepted only the helicopters.
