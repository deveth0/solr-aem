        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Operation Cathedral&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[police]] [[Sting operation|operation]] that broke up an international [[child pornography]] ring called The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wonderland Club&amp;apos;&amp;apos; operating over the [[Internet]]. It was led by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[National Crime Squad]] in cooperation with 13 other police forces around the globe,&amp;lt;ref name=pedoring&amp;gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/uk_news/1166643.stm Paedophiles&amp;apos; vast &amp;apos;lending library&amp;apos;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; who arrested 107 suspects across 12 countries on September 1, 1998. Seven [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based men were convicted for their part in the ring in 2001.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;*[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/UK/02/13/england.pornography/ Child porn gang face jail]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

One reason for the high profile of the operation was the unusually high number of images involved possessed and produced and distributed by Wonderland Club: 750,000 images with 1,200 unique identifiable faces. Despite substantial work by many of the agencies &amp;lt;!--who?--&amp;gt;involved only a very small number of those appearing in the images have been identified.

The investigation had been sparked by a tip-off from [[United States]] police investigating the rape of an eight-year-old girl broadcast live to pedophiles by webcam.&amp;lt;ref name=pedoring/&amp;gt; The international and highly organized nature of the ring has led to a much higher concern for the [[child sexual abuse]] that is child pornography.

==Risks to relatives==
Due to the lack of a proper legal framework, what has now become computer law, judges and lawyers in a few countries were unsure on how to interpret facts related to computers and the Internet. Because of the publicity the operation received, full names and addresses were almost always divulged to the media thus exposing direct relatives (wives and children) to potential danger from vigilante types among the general public. In Belgium in particular, the Police Judiciare had come under heavy criticism for the handling of the Dutroux case in 1995. The efforts to restore a more positive image and the moral aspect behind the operation led officers to hold a certain disregard for relatives and even consider them as potential accomplices.
