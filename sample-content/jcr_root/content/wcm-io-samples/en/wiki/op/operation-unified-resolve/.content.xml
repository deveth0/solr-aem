&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Operation Unified Resolve&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an air and ground operation to flush out and trap [[al-Qaeda]] fighters hiding in the eastern [[Afghanistan]] provinces.

Launched on 23 June 2003, Operation Unified Resolve is a joint operation between [[Pakistan]], United States, and Afghanistan. Over 500 troops, mostly from the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, began hunting the [[Taliban]] and al-Qaeda fighters in the provinces of Nangarhar and Kunar on Afghanistan&amp;apos;s eastern border. The operation is especially focused on the city of [[Jalalabad, Afghanistan|Jalalabad]], a known al-Qaeda stronghold strategically located on the main route between the Afghan capital [[Kabul]] and Pakistan city of [[Peshawar]].

Anti-coalition forces, led by former Afghan prime minister [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], have attacked coalition forces with their usual retinue of rockets, mines, and bobby traps. Hekmatyar has been organizing alliances between the remaining anti-coalition forces in the area and increasing their coordination.

In addition to hunting the Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters, Operation Unified Resolve also distributes humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people in the nearby valleys.
