The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Open Court Publishing Company&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[publisher]] with offices in [[Chicago]] and [[La Salle, Illinois]]. It is part of the [[Carus Publishing Company]] of [[Peru, Illinois]].

==History==
Open Court was founded in 1887 by [[Edward C. Hegeler]] of the Matthiessen-Hegeler Zinc Company, at one time the largest producer of [[zinc]] in the [[United States]]. Hegeler intended for the firm to serve the purpose of discussing religious and psychological problems on the principle that the scientific world-conception should be applied to religion.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite CAB|Hegeler, Edward C.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Its first managing editor was [[Paul Carus]], Hegeler&amp;apos;s son-in-law.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Fields138&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Fields 1992, pg. 138&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; For the first 80 years of its existence, the company had its offices in the [[Hegeler Carus Mansion]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/power-house/Content?oid=905535 |work=Chicago Reader |author=Jeffrey Felshman |title=Power House |date=May 31, 2001}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Open Court specializes in [[philosophy]], [[science]], and [[religion]], and was one of the first [[university press|academic press]]es in the country.  It was one of the first publishers of inexpensive editions of the classics.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Fields138&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; It also published the journals &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Open Court&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Monist]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;â€”the latter is still being published as of 2010.

==Popular culture &amp;amp; philosophy series==

One of Open Court Publishing&amp;apos;s best-selling series is its semi-annual &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Popular Culture &amp;amp; Philosophy&amp;apos;&amp;apos; series, under the editorship of George Reisch. Volumes on the philosophy underpinning such television shows as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Seinfeld]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Simpsons]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; propelled the series into the limelight, and have invited many imitators since, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] Philosophy and Pop Culture Series&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://blackwellpublishing.com/seriesbyseries.asp?ref=PPPZ The Blackwell Philosophy and Pop Culture Series].
