&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;OPML&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Outline Processor Markup Language&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is an [[XML]] format for [[Outline (list)|outlines]] (defined as &amp;quot;a tree, where each node contains a set of named attributes with string values&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Spec&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opml.org/spec|title=OPML 1.0 Specification|accessdate=12 June 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;). Originally developed by [[UserLand Software|UserLand]] as a native file format for the [[outliner]] application in its [[Radio UserLand]] product, it has since been adopted for other uses, the most common being to exchange lists of [[web feeds]] between web feed [[feed aggregator|aggregator]]s.

The OPML specification defines an outline as a hierarchical, ordered list of arbitrary elements.  The specification is fairly open which makes it suitable for many types of list data.

Support for OPML is available in [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] and many other RSS reader web sites and applications, can both import and export OPML files of subscriptions.

==Shortcomings==
{{unreferenced|date=May 2013}}
# The RFC 822 date format is considered obsolete, and amongst other things permits the representation of years as two digits. (RFC 822 has been superseded by RFC 2822 then RFC 5322.) In general, date and time formats should be represented according to  RFC 3339.
# Due to the semantics of the &amp;quot;expansionState&amp;quot; attribute:
#* The expansion state of the children of collapsed nodes cannot be stored
#* When an outline element is expanded, collapsed, added, deleted or moved, the expansion state of all elements below it must be recalculated
# Due to the arbitrary nature of the &amp;quot;type&amp;quot; attribute, and the acceptance of arbitrary attributes on &amp;quot;outline&amp;quot; elements, interoperability of OPML documents relies almost entirely on the undocumented conventions of content producers.
# MIME types aren&amp;apos;t clear; text/xml usually merely identifies the document as having XML content, while text/x-opml does not specify that the document is XML since it lacks the +xml suffix (see [[XML and MIME]]).
# Exporting your data from an OPML file to another format can&amp;apos;t be done without coding: no free tools are available to convert an OPML file to HTML, and browsers such as Firefox and Internet Explorer cannot display an OPML file.

==Validation==
[[Dave Winer]] has made a request for comments on a [http://www.opml.org/guidelinesForValidation proposal for validating OPML] and released a beta [http://validator.opml.org/ OPML validator].

Katy Ginger from DLESE has published [http://www.dlese.org/Metadata/opml/2.0/index.htm an XML Schema Document] for validating OPML 2.0. There is also a [http://static.userland.com/gems/radiodiscuss/opmlDtd.txt DTD available for OPML 1.0].

==Alternative specifications==
Alternative specifications have been proposed, notably these include [[OML]], [[XOXO]] and [[XBEL]].
