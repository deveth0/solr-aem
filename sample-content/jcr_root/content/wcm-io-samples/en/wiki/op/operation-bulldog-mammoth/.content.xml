&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Operation Bulldog Mammoth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[brigade]]-sized cordon and search of an [[Abu Ghurayb]] apartment complex, northwest of [[Baghdad]] on 4 December 2003 during the American-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. The operation lasted about five-and-a-half hours and involved approximately 1,450 soldiers.

This unusual [[brigade]]-sized cordon and search was led by the [[United States Army|US Army]]’s [[U.S. 1st Armored Division|1st Armored Div.]], 3rd Brigade Combat Team and was supported by the [[United States Army|US Army]]’s [[U.S. 82nd Airborne Division|82nd Airborne Division]], 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, more than 300 [[Iraqi Civil Defense Corps]] personnel and an [[Estonia]]n army [[platoon]].

Additionally the operation was also supported by two companies from the [[709th Military Police Battalion]], which provided an outer cordon, and four [[AH-64 Apache]] helicopters, which provided air support.

The cordon and search went through 2,400 apartments, 53 additional buildings and seized: more than 220 [[AK-47]] assault rifles, along with a number of machine guns, pistols and other rifles; five [[rocket propelled grenade]]s and 15 [[Rocket propelled grenade|RPG]] sights; 10 grenades; 12 mortar sights; various electrical components associated with improvised explosive devise construction; Russian-made night vision devices; protective masks; 24 plates of body armor and a U.S.-made vest; [[Saddam Hussein]] paraphernalia; and 16 cases of U.S. military [[MRE|meals, ready to eat]].

Additionally the soldiers detained 40 personnel, including three on a by-name &amp;quot;black&amp;quot; list of suspects who were caught in the outer cordon while trying to escape the area.

Although intelligence reports narrowed in on the particular apartment complex as a haven for anti-coalition forces, no shots were fired during this operation.
