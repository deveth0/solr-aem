        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Matt Quinn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, better known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Optical&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a [[drum and bass]] [[Music producer|producer]] and [[DJ]] from [[England]].

He is best known for his work with [[Ed Rush]], fellow head of the [[Virus Recordings]] label, and as a pioneer of the [[techstep]] and [[neurofunk]] sound.  His first single for [[Metalheadz]], &amp;apos;To Shape the Future&amp;apos;/&amp;apos;Raging Calm&amp;apos; (1997) and his collaborative material with Ed Rush, such as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wormhole (album)|Wormhole]],&amp;apos;&amp;apos; album (1998) were archetypal developments in the style. The duo followed this debut album with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Creeps&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2000) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Original Doctor Shade]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2003), as well as countless singles and remixes.

He also notably did most of the engineering and production work for [[Grooverider]]&amp;apos;s album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mysteries of Funk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  In addition, he has produced solo, and released in collaboration with many artists, including [[Trace (artist)|Trace]], [[Dom &amp;amp; Roland]], [[Fierce (band)|Fierce]], and his brother [[Matrix (artist)|Matrix]].

His music appears continuously in the [[WipEout]] series of videogames, notable for its association with electronica and electronic dance musics.
