During [[World War II]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Operation Grenade&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the crossing of the Roer ([[Rur]]) river between [[Roermond]] and [[Düren]] by the [[Ninth United States Army|U.S. 9th Army]] in February 1945.

On 9 February, the U.S. Ninth Army—operating under [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Sir Bernard Montgomery]]′s [[British 21st Army Group]] since the [[Battle of the Bulge]]—was to cross the Roer and link up with the [[Canadian First Army|Canadian 1st Army]] coming from the [[Nijmegen]] area of the [[Netherlands]] in [[Operation Veritable]], which had started at 05:00 on 8 February. However, once the Canadians had advanced, the Germans destroyed the dams upstream. This stopped the Americans from crossing as planned. It had been anticipated that the Germans would try to do this, and that General Bradley′s [[Twelfth United States Army Group|U.S. 12th Army Group]] could capture them in time to stop the flooding.

During the two weeks that the river was flooded, [[Adolf Hitler]] would not allow [[Field Marshal (Germany)|Field Marshal]] [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] to withdraw behind the [[Rhine]], arguing that it would only delay the inevitable fight. He ordered him to fight where his forces stood.

The 9th Army was finally able to cross the river on 23 February. By then, other Allied forces were also close to the Rhine. Rundstedt′s divisions—which had remained on the west bank of the Rhine—were cut to pieces in the [[Rhineland Campaign|Battle for the Rhineland]], and 290,000 men were taken prisoner.
