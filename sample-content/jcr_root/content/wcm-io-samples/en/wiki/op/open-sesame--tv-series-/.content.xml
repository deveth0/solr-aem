&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Open Sesame&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[children&amp;apos;s television series]] composed solely of the skits and segments of the long-running American television series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sesame Street]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. While some countries air the American program in whole, and some create their own versions of the show, many more air this title of loosely associated skits, as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Open Sesame&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The name is a pun based on the [[magic words]] &amp;quot;Open sesame&amp;quot; which are used in the legend of [[Ali Baba]].

==Australia==
Open Sesame is a half hour compilation series of older Sesame Street sketches, seen on Nick Jr. in Australia. The series follows the same format as other Open Sesame packages, only retaining the original soundtrack.
Separate from the package, the Australian Muppet Ollie appears in Play Along with Ollie interstitials scattered throughout the programming schedule.
==Earliest Known Use==
The earliest seasons of Sesamstrasse, while not officially part of the format, used a variation, but incorporated a greater amount of local film and
cartoon inserts.
