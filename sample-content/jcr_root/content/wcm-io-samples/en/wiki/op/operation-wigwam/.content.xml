&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Operation Wigwam&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; involved a single test of the [[Mark 90 Betty nuclear bomb]]. It was conducted between [[Operation Teapot]] and [[Operation Redwing]] on May 14, 1955, about 500 miles southwest of [[San Diego]], [[California]]. 6,800 personnel aboard 30 ships were involved in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wigwam&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The purpose of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wigwam&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was to determine the vulnerability of submarines to deeply detonated nuclear weapons, and to evaluate the feasibility of using such weapons in a combat situation. The task force commander, Admiral [[John Sylvester]], was embarked on the task force [[flagship]] {{USS|Mount McKinley|AGC-7}}.

The test device was suspended by a 2,000 foot (660 meters) cable under a barge. A six-mile tow line connected a fleet [[tug]], the [[USS Tawasa (AT-92)|USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tawasa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], and the shot [[barge]] itself. Suspended from the tow lines of other tugs were three miniature unmanned [[submarines]] named &amp;quot;Squaws&amp;quot;, each packed with cameras and telemetry instruments.

The time of detonation was 1300 hrs Pacific Time. The test was carried out without incident, and [[radiation]] effects were negligible. The device yielded 30 [[kiloton]]s. Only three personnel received doses of over 0.5 rems.

The equipment intended for direct measurement of the [[underwater explosion|explosion-generated underwater bubble]] was not operational at the time of the shot, but based on other measurements, the bubble&amp;apos;s maximum radius was calculated as 376 feet, and its pulsation period approximately 2.83 seconds.
