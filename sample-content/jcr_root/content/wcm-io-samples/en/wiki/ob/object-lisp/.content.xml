        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Object Lisp&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[computer]] [[programming language]], a dialect of the [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] language. It was an [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] extension for the Lisp dialect [[Lisp Machine Lisp]], designed by [[Lisp Machines]], Inc. Object Lisp was also an early example of [[prototype-based programming]].

It was seen as a competitor to other object-oriented extensions to Lisp at around the same time such as [[Flavors (programming language)|Flavors]], in use by [[Symbolics]], [[Common Objects]] developed by [[Hewlett-Packard]], and [[CommonLoops]], in use by [[Xerox]].

Object Lisp was also used in early versions of [[Macintosh Common Lisp]]. There, the user interface toolkit was written using Object Lisp.
