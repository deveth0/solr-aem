&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Obed River&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[stream]] draining a part of the [[Cumberland Plateau]] in [[Tennessee]].  It, and particularly its tributaries, are important streams for [[whitewater]] enthusiasts.

The Obed River rises in [[Cumberland County, Tennessee]], just south of [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]].  It is bridged by [[U.S. Highway 70]] between downtown Crossville and the municipal [[airport]], and meets its confluence with the [[Little Obed River]] near a bridge on U.S. Highway 70N and an abandoned [[railroad]] bridge which was formerly part of the rail system linking [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]. Shortly thereafter, it is bridged by [[U.S. Highway 127]] and [[Interstate 40]].  Except during periods of very high flow, the stream is scarcely visible from these bridges because of the depth of its gorge.

From there the stream enters a rather remote area.  After several miles it is bridged by [[State Route 298 (Tennessee)|State Route 298]] (Genesis Road).  From this point to its mouth it is designated as a &amp;quot;National Wild and Scenic River&amp;quot; along with Clear Creek and Daddys Creek.&amp;lt;ref name=NWSR&amp;gt;{{cite web

|title       = Obed River

|accessdate  = July 11, 2011
}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
The direction of flow changes gradually from largely south to north to largely west to east.  Shortly after crossing into [[Morgan County, Tennessee|Morgan County]] it receives the flow of Daddys Creek, which is a good whitewater rafting stream. Downstream from this is the mouth of Clear Creek. This stream is also part of the Obed River &amp;quot;Wild and Scenic&amp;quot; designation; like Daddys Creek, it too is a premiere whitewater stream during periods of high flow.

Several miles below the mouth of Clear Creek is the confluence with the [[Emory River]].  Although the Obed River is the larger of the two, the river takes the name of the Emory River below the confluence.
