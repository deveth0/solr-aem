It was then an administrative position. It disappears into the circle of Adaels administered from [[Tadjoura]] in 1929, becoming a post in 1931. Briefly elevated to circle during the Second World War, he becomes formally independent in 1963. Its boundaries have changed very little over time, they have not been changed since 1939.

According to the 2009 Census, the local population consists of 37,856 individuals, 16,370 of whom are nomads. The city is a governorate located in the extreme north of the country with an area of 5700 km2 and an estimated population of 40,128, Obock district offers great opportunities in the field of fisheries. Part of the activities of the Port of Djibouti as transhipment be relocated in the city that is the capital of the district. Major cities are Medeho, Waddi, Lahassa, Khor Angar, Moulhoule, Alaili-Dadda, Andoli, Bisidirou The May 11, 1862 the French signed a treaty of alliance and friendship with the Afar and Issas sultans. At that time there were only 400 Obock capital in 1866 it had more than two thousand! Léonce Lagarde was appointed governor on 5 September 1987 and was the capital Obock 1 of the land of the Afars and Issas. There are up to today the remains of the Great Obock despite the ruins.
