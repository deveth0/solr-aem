&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;OBEX&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (abbreviation of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;OBject EXchange&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also termed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;IrOBEX&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a communications protocol that facilitates the exchange of binary objects between devices. It is maintained by the [[Infrared Data Association]] but has also been adopted by the [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group]] and the [[SyncML]] wing of the [[Open Mobile Alliance]] (OMA). One of OBEX&amp;apos;s earliest popular applications was in the [[Palm Pilot|Palm III]] [[personal digital assistant]]. This PDA and its many successors use OBEX to exchange business cards, data, even applications.

Although OBEX was initially designed for infrared, it has now been adopted by [[Bluetooth]], and is also used over [[RS232]], [[USB]], [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]], and in devices such as [[Livescribe]] smartpens.

==Comparison to HTTP==
OBEX is similar in design and function to [[HTTP]] in providing the client with a reliable transport for connecting to a server and may then request or provide objects. But OBEX differs in many important respects:

*HTTP is normally layered above a [[TCP/IP]] link. OBEX is commonly implemented on an [[IrLAP]]/[[IrLMP]]/[[Tiny TP]] stack on an [[IrDA]] device. In [[Bluetooth]], OBEX is implemented on a [[Baseband]]/[[Bluetooth_protocols#ACL_.28Asynchronous_Connection_Less.29_link|ACL]]/[[Bluetooth_protocols#L2CAP_.28Logical_Link_Control_and_Adaptation_Protocol.29|L2CAP]]/[[Bluetooth_protocols#RFCOMM_.28Radio_Frequency_Communication.29|RFCOMM]] stack. Other such &amp;quot;bindings&amp;quot; of OBEX are possible.
*HTTP uses human-readable text, but OBEX uses binary-formatted type-length-value triplets named &amp;quot;Headers&amp;quot; to exchange information about a request or an object. These are much easier to parse by resource-limited devices.
*HTTP transactions are inherently stateless; generally a HTTP client opens a connection, makes a single request, receives its response, and either closes the connection or [[HTTP persistent connection|makes other unrelated requests]]. In OBEX, a single transport connection may bear many related operations. In fact, recent additions to the OBEX specification allow an abruptly closed transaction to be resumed with all state information intact.

==Profiles==
OBEX is the foundation for many higher-layer &amp;quot;profiles&amp;quot;:
