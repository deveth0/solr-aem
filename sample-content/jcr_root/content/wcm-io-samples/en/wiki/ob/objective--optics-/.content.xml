In an [[optics|optical]] instrument, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;objective&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the optical element that gathers light from the object being observed and focuses the [[ray (optics)|light rays]] to produce a [[real image]]. Objectives can be single [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] or [[mirror]]s, or combinations of several optical elements. They are used in [[microscope]]s, [[telescope]]s, [[camera]]s, [[slide projector]]s, [[CD player]]s and many other optical instruments. Objectives are also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;object lenses&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;object glasses&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;objective glasses&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Types==
===Microscope===
The objective lens of a microscope is the one at the bottom near the sample. At its simplest, it is a very high-powered [[magnifying glass]], with very short [[focal length]]. This is brought very close to the specimen being examined so that the light from the specimen comes to a focus inside the microscope tube. The objective itself is usually a cylinder containing one or more lenses that are typically made of glass; its function is to collect light from the sample.

A typical microscope has several objective lenses with different focal lengths screwed into a circular nose piece which may be rotated to select the required lens. The lenses are typically designed to be [[Parfocal lens|parfocal]], which means that when one changes from one to another the sample stays in [[focus (optics)|focus]].

Microscope objectives are characterized by two parameters: [[magnification]] and [[numerical aperture]]. The former typically ranges from 4× to 100×, while the latter ranges from 0.10 to 1.25, corresponding to focal lengths of about 40 to 2&amp;amp;nbsp;mm, respectively. For high magnification applications, an [[oil-immersion objective]] or water-immersion objective has to be used. The objective is specially designed and [[Index-matching material|refractive index matching oil]] or water must fill the air gap between the front element and the object to allow the numerical aperture to exceed 1, and hence give greater resolution at high magnification. Numerical apertures as high as 1.6 can be achieved with oil immersion.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympusmicro.com/primer/anatomy/objectives.html |title=Microscope objectives |work=Olympus Microscopy Resource Center |first=Spring |last=Kenneth |coauthors=Keller, H. Ernst; Davidson, Michael W. |accessdate=29 Oct 2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

===Photography and imaging===

[[Camera lens]]es (usually referred to as &amp;quot;photographic objectives&amp;quot; instead of simply &amp;quot;objectives&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The Focal encyclopedia of photography  by Leslie Stroebel, Richard D. Zakia, 1993 edition, page 515&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) need to cover a large focal plane so are made up of a number of optical lens elements to correct [[optical aberration]]s. [[Image projector]]s (such as video, movie, and slide projectors) use objective lenses that simply reverse the function of a camera lens,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Light fantastic: the art and design of stage lighting, Max Keller, Johannes Weiss - page 71&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; with lenses designed to cover a large image plane and project it at a distance onto another surface.

===Telescope===

In a telescope the objective is the lens at the front end of a [[Refracting telescope|refractor]] or the image-forming [[primary mirror]] of a [[Reflecting telescope|reflecting]] or [[Catadioptric system#Catadioptric telescopes|catadioptric telescope]]. A telescope&amp;apos;s light-gathering power and [[angular resolution]] are both directly related to the diameter (or &amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;) of its objective lens or mirror. The larger the objective, the dimmer the object it can view and the more detail it can resolve.
