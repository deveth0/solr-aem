{{for|the Max Frisch novel|Homo Faber (novel)}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Homo faber&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Latin]] for &amp;quot;Man the Creator&amp;quot; in reference to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;homo sapiens&amp;apos;&amp;apos; meaning &amp;quot;wise man&amp;quot;) is a philosophical concept articulated by [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Max Scheler]] that refers to humans as controlling the environment through tools. [[Henri Bergson]] also referred to the concept in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Creative Evolution&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1907), defining [[intelligence]], in its original sense, as the &amp;quot;faculty to create artificial objects, in particular tools to make tools, and to indefinitely variate its makings.&amp;quot;

In Latin literature, [[Appius Claudius Caecus]] uses this term in his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sententiæ&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, referring to the ability of man to control his destiny and what surrounds him: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Homo faber suae quisque fortunae&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Every man is the artifex of his destiny).

In [[anthropology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Homo faber&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as the &amp;quot;working man&amp;quot;, is confronted with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Homo ludens]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the &amp;quot;playing man&amp;quot;, who is concerned with amusements, humor, and leisure.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Homo faber&amp;apos;&amp;apos; can be also used in opposition or juxtaposition to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Demiurge|deus faber]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;God the Creator&amp;quot;), an archetype of which are the various [[Vulcan (mythology)|gods of the forge]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Homo Faber (novel)|Homo Faber]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the title of an influential novel by the Swiss author [[Max Frisch]], published in 1957. The book was made into the film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Voyager (film)|Voyager]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, starring [[Sam Shepard]] and [[Julie Delpy]].

Homo Faber was one of the five [[IB Middle Years Programme|IBMYP]] areas of interaction, before it was replaced with &amp;quot;Human Ingenuity&amp;quot;.

&amp;quot;Homo Faber&amp;quot; is also the title of a short poem by [[Frank Bidart]] that is included in his collection &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Desire&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1997).

In [[Ray Bradbury]]&amp;apos;s novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Fahrenheit 451]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1953), a character named Faber constructs a hidden radio earpiece that he uses to guide the thoughts and actions of the book&amp;apos;s protagonist, Guy Montag.
