{{About|Theater operations|Household servants|Butler}}
In [[theatre]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;house management&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; concerns the selling of [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]]s, the [[wiktionary:usher|usher]]ing of [[patron]]s in [[FOH (theatre)|front of house]] areas, and the maintenance and management of the [[Theater (structure)|theatre building]] itself. House management staff usually work for the theatre, under the supervision of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;house manager&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and not for the theatrical [[wiktionary:troupe|troupe]] which is currently occupying it. Often in regional or smaller theatres the responsibility falls under the aegis of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;production manager&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In any case, house management works closely with the [[production management]] team for the presentation of the theatrical production.

In domestic services, &amp;quot;house management&amp;quot; refers to the overseeing of employees that make of the staff of the household, including but not limited to drivers, nannies, and housekeepers.
