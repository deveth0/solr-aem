&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hoodening&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hodening&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is an East [[Kent]], [[England]] tradition vaguely related to [[Mummers|Mumming]] and the [[Morris dance]], and dating back at least to the mid-18th century. Related traditions also exist in [[Wales]] (including at [[Caerleon]], near [[Newport]]) and [[Lancashire]]. It was centred on the ploughing teams at farms in and around [[Thanet]], although groups also existed in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] which were more related to the men-at-sea, and who concentrated on performing music. The common feature to all groups was the appearance of a Hooden Horse - a wooden horse&amp;apos;s head mounted on a pole, with a [[sackcloth]] attached to hide the bearer. The head would normally have a hinged jaw which could snap shut with a mighty crack.

The groups would tour the area in the period leading up to Christmas (or the [[Winter Solstice]]), engaging in tomfoolery (horseplay) at local landowners&amp;apos; houses and requesting &amp;apos;largesse&amp;apos;, i.e. funds to tide them over the slack period of the year.

Despite occasional breaks, the tradition is a living one, and is currently performed by several teams around East Kent. The money raised is now normally given to charity.

A slightly modified version still takes place in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Canada]]. The main differences being that it is now just a social festivity in which the Mummers get dressed up and visit the elderly, dancing about the house and acting foolish.

== Possible origins ==

The edited (unknown scribe, approx 1000) Pseudo-[[Penitential]] of [[Archbishop Theodore]] (d. 690) speaks of any who, on the [[kalends of January]] (January 1), clothe themselves with the skins of cattle and carry heads of animals. This, coupled with the fact that among the [[Norse paganism|pagan]] [[Norsemen|Scandinavians]] the horse was often the sacrifice made at the [[winter solstice]] to [[Odin]] for success in battle,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} has been thought to justify the theory that &amp;quot;hodening&amp;quot; is a corruption of Odining.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Others believe that that it is called the hooden horse because the horse forms a hood over the operator.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}
