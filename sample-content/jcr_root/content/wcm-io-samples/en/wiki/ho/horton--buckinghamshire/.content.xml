&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Horton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in the [[parish]] of [[Ivinghoe]], in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].

The name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Horton (disambiguation)|Horton]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a common one in England. It derives from [[Old English language|Old English]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;horu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;dirt&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;tÅ«n&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;settlement, farm, estate&amp;apos;, presumably meaning &amp;apos;farm on muddy soil&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Victor Watts (ed.), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names, Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), s.v. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;HORTON&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Although in the parish of Ivinghoe, the hamlet is nearer to [[Cheddington]] with its shops and churches, so that is the main village to which most residents of Horton feel most attached.

The hamlet of Horton was held after the [[Norman Conquest]] by the de Brocas family.  The hamlet is very small, but a few new modern houses have been built over the last twenty years, most notably Brocas Way and The Grange.  The latter was built in the 1970s as a [[dower house]] for Horton Hall.

Horton Hall is a large moated farmhouse with 18th-century origins.  It is probably on the site of the original manor or hall.  Today it is the home of a charity fund-raiser, and former champion amateur jockey, who breeds horses on the adjoining farm.

Two 16th-century [[half-timbered]] cottages remain in the village. One, still known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;King&amp;apos;s Head Cottage&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was formerly an [[inn]].  The other, which is older, is a renovated Tudor hall on the outskirts of the hamlet.
