&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hohenwerfen Castle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-de|Burg Hohenwerfen}}) stands high above the [[Austria]]n town of [[Werfen]] in the [[Salzach]] valley, approximately {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Salzburg]]. The castle is surrounded by the [[Berchtesgaden Alps]] and the adjacent [[Tennengebirge]] mountain range. The fortification is a &amp;quot;sister&amp;quot; of [[Hohensalzburg Castle]] both dated from the 11th century.

==History==
The former [[fortification]] was built between 1075 and 1078 during the Imperial [[Investiture Controversy]] by the order of Archbishop [[Gebhard of Salzburg]] as a strategic [[bulwark]] atop a {{convert|155|m|ft|abbr=on}} high rock. Gebhard, an ally of [[Pope Gregory VII]] and antiking [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden]], had three major castles extended to secure the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg archbishopric]] against the forces of King [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]]: Hohenwerfen, Hohensalzburg and [[Burgruine Petersberg|Petersberg Castle]] at [[Friesach]] in [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]]. Nevertheless Gebhard was expelled in 1077 and could not return to Salzburg until 1086, only to die at Hohenwerfen two years later.

In the following centuries Hohenwerfen served Salzburg&amp;apos;s rulers, the [[Prince-Bishop|prince-archbishops]], not only as a military base but also as a residence and hunting retreat. The fortress was extended in the 12th century and to a lesser extent again in the 16th century during the [[German Peasants&amp;apos; War]], when in 1525 and 1526 riotous farmers and miners from the south of Salzburg moved towards the city, laying fire and severely damaging the castle.

Alternatively it was used as a state [[prison]] and therefore had a somewhat sinister reputation. Its prison walls have witnessed the tragic fate of many &amp;apos;criminals&amp;apos; who spent their days there - maybe their last - under inhumane conditions, and, periodically, various highly ranked noblemen have also been imprisoned there including rulers such as Archbishop Adalbert III, arrested by his own &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[ministerialis|ministeriales]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1198, Count Albert of Friesach (in 1253), the [[Duchy of Styria|Styrian]] governor Siegmund von Dietrichstein, captured by insurgent peasants in 1525, and Prince-Archbishop [[Wolf Dietrich Raitenau]], who died here in 1617 after six years of imprisonment.

In 1931 the fortress, since 1898 owned by [[Archduke Eugen of Austria]] was again damaged by a fire and, though largely restored, finally had to be sold to the Salzburg &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Reichsgau]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; administration in 1938. After World War II it was used as a training camp by the Austrian [[Gendarmerie (Austria)|Gendarmerie]] (rural police) until 1987.

Nowadays the bastion, enlarged and renovated several times over the centuries, functions as an adventure castle for its visitors. Among the numerous attractions offered by the fortress are guided tours showing its extensive weapons collection, the historical Salzburg [[Falconry]] with the falconry museum as well as a fortress tavern. The historic Falconry Centre is a special attraction, offering daily flight demonstrations by various birds of prey.

== Films ==
* Hohenwerfen was used as the castle &amp;apos;Schloss Adler&amp;apos; in the 1968 film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Where Eagles Dare]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, although the memorable [[Aerial tramway|cable car]] scenes were filmed using the [http://www.feuerkogel.net/winter/service/geschichte-der-seilbahn/ Feuerkogel-Drahtseilbahn] in [[Ebensee]] as Hohenwerfen Castle has no cable car, unlike the fictional &amp;apos;Schloss Adler&amp;apos; .
* Exterior shots of the castle were used as a French hotel in the movie &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Just Married]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
* Exterior shots of Hohenwerfen Castle were used in the TV mini series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The 10th Kingdom]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  In that series, it represented the Snow White Memorial Prison.
