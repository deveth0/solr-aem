{{Wiktionary}}
In [[American English]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Holy Rollers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refers to [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] [[Christian]] churchgoers.&amp;lt;ref name=mw&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/holy%20roller |title=Holy Roller |accessdate=2010-09-14 |quote=A member of one of the Protestant sects whose worship meetings are characterized by spontaneous expressions of emotional excitement. |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The term is commonly used derisively, as if to describe people literally rolling on the floor or [[Glossolalia|speaking in tongues]] in an uncontrolled manner.

It is generally considered pejorative, but some have reclaimed it as a badge of honor, [[William M. Branham|William Branham]] wrote: &amp;quot;And what the world calls today holy-roller, that&amp;apos;s the way I worship [[Jesus]] [[Christ]].&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nathan.co.za/message.asp?sermonum=119 &amp;quot;Why I Am a Holy-Roller&amp;quot;], a sermon by William Marrion Branham, August 1953&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Gospel singer [[Andrae Crouch]] stated, &amp;quot;They call us holy rollers, and what they say is true.  But if they knew what we were rollin&amp;apos; about, they&amp;apos;d be rollin&amp;apos; too.&amp;quot;

==History==
[[Merriam-Webster]] traces the word to 1841.&amp;lt;ref name=mw/&amp;gt; The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; cites an 1893 memoir by [[Charles Godfrey Leland]],  in which he says &amp;quot;When the [[Holy Spirit]] seized them ... the Holy Rollers ... rolled over and over on the floor.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50208190?query_type=word&amp;amp;queryword=roller &amp;quot;roller, n&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, definition 17b.] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Oxford English Dictionary&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. (Account required for online access).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Similar disparaging terms directed at outspoken Christians but later embraced by them include [[Jesus freak]]s or, from former centuries, [[Methodists]], [[Quakers]], and [[Shakers]].

==Usage==
*[[Gifford Pinchot]] in 1919: &amp;quot;Apparently no meeting for any purpose is to be tolerated except the Holy Roller meetings themselves. These theoretically and in fact ... The Holy Roller church in this community, as elsewhere, in its total influence promotes immorality. ...&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |author=[[Charles Otis Gill]] and [[Gifford Pinchot]] |coauthors= |title=Six thousand country churches |year=1919 |publisher= |page=23 |quote= | url= |isbn= }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Time (magazine)|Time]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on March 4, 1929: &amp;quot;In the village of [[New Hampshire, Ohio]], the Rev. Ray Dotson, &amp;apos;Holy Roller&amp;apos; [[Methodist]], so wailed and shrieked, so frothed and grovelled, that he got Fred Conrad, a 200-lb. traction worker, all worked up.&amp;quot;
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Time (magazine)|Time]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on October 12, 1936: &amp;quot;When Jesus Christ first appeared to His assembled disciples after His resurrection, He told them that believers &amp;apos;shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents&amp;apos; (Mark: 16:17, 18). To many a U. S. religionist of the Pentecostal or &amp;quot;Holy Roller&amp;quot; variety, the &amp;apos;gift of tongues&amp;apos; has long been vivid reality.&amp;quot;
