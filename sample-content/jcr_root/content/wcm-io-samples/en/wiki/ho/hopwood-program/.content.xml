        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hopwood Program&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; administers the [[University of Michigan]] [[Hopwood Award]] in [[literature]], as well as several other awards in writing. It is located in the Hopwood Room at the University of Michigan and serves the needs and interests of Hopwood contestants. The Room was established by Professor [[Roy W. Cowden]], Director of the Hopwood Awards from 1933 to 1952, who generously contributed a part of his library, which has grown through the addition of many volumes of contemporary literature. In addition to housing the winning manuscripts from the past years of the contests, the Hopwood Room has a lending library of twentieth -century literature, a
generous supply of non-circulating current periodicals, some reference
books on how to get published, information on graduate and summer writing
programs, and a collection of screen plays donated by former Hopwood winner
[[Lawrence Kasdan]].
