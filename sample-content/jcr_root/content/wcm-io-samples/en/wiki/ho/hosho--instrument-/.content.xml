The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hosho&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are Zimbabwean [[musical instruments]] consisting of a pair of [[maranka]] (mapudzi) [[gourds]], known as with seeds. They typically contain [[hota]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Canna indica]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) seeds inside them.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://dandemutande.org/Magazine/zimmusic.html#Hosho |title=Hosho |accessdate=2008-02-17 |last=Novitski |first=Paul |year= 2000 |work=Dandemutande Magazine }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hosho&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are used to accompany [[Shona music]], especially [[mbira]] music. They make a rattling sound that western ears may be unaccustomed to hearing. However, this accompaniment is essential when playing [[mbira]] and/or [[marimba]] music. So essential, in fact, that extra vibrating elements such as [[mirliton]]s (buzzing membranes made from spider webs) are attached to the resonating tubes of marimbas and [[machachara]] (miniature Hosho made from seashells or bottle caps) are attached to the mbira and its [[deze]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmichaelwilliams.com/PNGettingStartedMbira.pdf |title=Machachara|accessdate=2008-08-18 |last=Williams |first=Michael |year= 1997 |work=Percussive Notes Magazine }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Mbira]]s and [[marimbas]] from [[Africa]]; and even other instruments, such as [[drum]]s will have some kind of rattles associated with their use.

From a western perspective the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hosho&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are seen as accompanying instruments to mbira, when in actuality they are seen as the lead instruments by the [[mbira]] players. See a typical use of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hosho&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by selecting the link at the end of this paragraph, as played together with the [[mbira]] at [[Zimfest]] 2008, by [[Musekiwa Chingodza]].

A smaller version of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hosho&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is made of a wild orange called a [[damba]], tied together with sticks and filled with [[hota]] seeds or pebbles.

Other related [[percussion instrument]]s from [[Zimbabwe]] include the [[magavhu]] (leg rattle) and [[ngoma]] ([[drum]]).
