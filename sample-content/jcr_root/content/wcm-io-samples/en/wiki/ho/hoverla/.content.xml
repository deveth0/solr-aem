&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hoverla mountain&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Cyrillic]]: Говерла, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hoverla&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; {{lang-hu|Hóvár}}; {{lang-ro|Hovârla}}; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Goverla&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, {{lang-pl|Howerla}} ) at {{convert|2061|m|ft|0}}, is the highest mountain in [[Ukraine]] and part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The mountain is located in the Eastern [[Beskides]], in the [[Chornohora]] region. The slopes are covered with [[beech]] and [[spruce]] forests, above which there is a belt of [[sub-alpine]] meadows called [[polonyna]] in Ukrainian. At the eastern slope there is the main spring of the [[Prut]] river. The name is of [[Old Hungarian alphabet|Old Hungarian]] origin and means a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;snow mountain&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=BO2UmY4WtD8#!

The date of the first ascent is unknown. In late 19th century the mountain became a notable tourist attraction, especially among tourists from nearby cities of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. In 1880 the first tourist route between the peak of Hoverla and Krasny Luh was marked by [[Leopold Wajgel]] of the [[Polskie Towarzystwo Tatrzańskie|Galician Tatra Society]]. The following year the first tourist shelter was founded there.

In the 20th century the mountain has been increasingly gaining popularity as an extreme sports site. Some routes are classified as 1A in the winter period (from late autumn to May), according to the USSR grading system. Nowadays because of its prominence too many unskilled extreme-lovers are taking attempts to climb it in winter, resulting in regular frostbites or even deaths.

In October 2007 the [[new Right]] pro-Russian [[Eurasia Party]]-affiliated “Eurasian Youth Union” vandalized the official [[Tryzub|Ukrainian state symbol]]s that had been placed on the summit of the Hoverla mountain.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://unian.net/eng/news/news-218198.html Eurasian Youth Union outraged state symbols of Ukraine (photo)], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[UNIAN]] News Agency&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, October 22, 2007&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
