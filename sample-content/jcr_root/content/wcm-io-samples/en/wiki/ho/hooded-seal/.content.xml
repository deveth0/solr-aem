The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hooded seal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cystophora cristata&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is an [[arctic]] [[pinniped]] found only in the central and western [[North Atlantic]] ranging from [[Svalbard]] in the east to the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] in the west.

==Naming==
The generic name means &amp;quot;bladder-bearer&amp;quot; in [[Greek language|Greek]], from the species&amp;apos; unusual [[Sexual selection|sexual ornament]], a peculiar [[inflatable]] bladder on the head of the adult male – this bladder hangs between his eyes and down over his upper lip in the deflated state. In addition, he can inflate a large balloon-like sac from one of his nostrils. This is done by shutting one nostril valve and inflating a membrane which then protrudes from the other nostril.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.drawfluffy.com/hooded-seal.html Hooded Seal (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cystophora cristata&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), a Weird Animal]. Drawfluffy.com. Retrieved on 2011-09-16.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==The bulge==
The bulge develops when the seal is four years old. The male can blow up this bulge, so that it is the size of its head.

==Size==
Adult males are {{convert|2.6|m}} long on average, and weigh {{convert|300|-|410|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is obvious from birth and females are much smaller: {{convert|2.03|m}} long and weighing {{convert|145|-|300|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=304 Hooded Seals, Cystophora cristata]. marinebio.org&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.arkive.org/hooded-seal/cystophora-cristata/#text=Facts Hooded seal images]. arkive.org&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The colour is silvery; the body is scattered with dark, irregular marks. The head is darker than the rest of the body, and without marks.

==Life cycle==
In April through June, after the breeding season, this species travels long distances to feed and eventually gather together again in separate [[moulting]] areas on the ice from June through August. After moulting, it disperses widely again to feed in the late summer and autumn before returning to the breeding areas in late winter.

==Breeding==
There are four major breeding areas: the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the &amp;quot;Front&amp;quot; east of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Davis Strait]] (between [[Greenland]] and [[northern Canada]]) and the West Ice near [[Jan Mayen]].

==Offspring==
[[File:Hooded seal crop.JPG|left|Hooded seal pup (next to researcher) on ice in the Gulf of St. Lawrence|thumb]]
Pups are about {{convert|1|m}} long at birth and weigh about {{convert|24|kg}}. They are born on the ice from mid-March to early April with a well-developed [[blubber]] layer and having shed their pre-natal coat. They are born with a slate blue-grey coat (giving them the name &amp;quot;blueback&amp;quot;), with a pale cream color on the belly, which they will moult after about 14 months. Nursing of the pup lasts for an average of only 4 days, the shortest [[lactation]] period of any mammal, during which the pup doubles in size, gaining around 7 kg/day. This is possible because the milk that they drink has a fat content of 60%.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7601954|year=1995|last1=Iverson|first1=SJ|last2=Oftedal|first2=OT|last3=Bowen|first3=WD|last4=Boness|first4=DJ|last5=Sampugna|first5=J|title=Prenatal and postnatal transfer of fatty acids from mother to pup in the hooded seal|volume=165|issue=1|pages=1–12|journal=Journal of comparative physiology. B, Biochemical, systemic, and environmental physiology}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The female pup will mature between ages 3 and 6, whereas the male pup will mature between ages 5 and 7.

==Lifespan==
The hooded seal can live to about age 30 to 35.
