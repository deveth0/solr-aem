A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hoof&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|uː|f}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ʊ|f}}), plural &amp;apos;&amp;apos;hooves&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|uː|v|z}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ʊ|v|z}}) or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;hoofs&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ʊ|f|s}}, is the tip of a [[toe]] of an [[ungulate]] [[mammal]], strengthened by a thick, horny, [[keratin]] covering. The hoof consists of a hard or rubbery sole and a hard wall formed by a thick [[Nail (anatomy)|nail]] rolled around the tip of the toe. The weight of the animal is normally borne by both the sole and the edge of the hoof wall. Hooves grow continuously, and are constantly worn down by use.

Most [[even-toed ungulate]]s (such as [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[deer]], [[cattle]], [[bison]] and [[pig]]s) have two main hooves on each foot, together called a [[cloven hoof]].  Most of these cloven-hoofed animals also have two smaller hoofs called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[dew-claw]]s&amp;apos;&amp;apos; a little further up the leg &amp;amp;ndash; these are not normally used for walking, but in some species with larger dew-claws (such as deer and pigs) they may touch the ground when running or jumping, or if the ground is soft.  Other cloven-hoofed animals (such as [[giraffe]]s and [[pronghorn]]s) have no dew claws.  In some so-called &amp;quot;cloven-hoofed&amp;quot; animals such as [[camel]]s, there are no hooves proper &amp;amp;ndash; the toe is softer, and the hoof itself is reduced to little more than a nail.

Some [[odd-toed ungulate]]s ([[Equidae|equid]]s) have one hoof on each foot; others (including [[rhinoceros]]es, [[tapir]]s and many [[extinct]] species) have (or had) three distinct hoofed or heavily nailed toes, or one hoof and two dew-claws.  The tapir is a special case, having three toes on each hind foot and four toes on each front foot.

==Uses==
Hooves have historical significance in ceremonies and games.  They have been used in burial ceremonies.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.zotero.org/samwalsh/items/7EBE4GDE|author=M. E. Robertson-Mackay |title=A head and hooves burial beneath a round barrow, with other Neolithic and Bronze Age sites on Hemp Knoll, near Avebury, Wiltshire |publisher=Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society|year= 1980|format= |work=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Hooves have also been used in the manufacture of high-end [[glue]]s.
