==Station overview==

===Facilities===

Holmesglen is located at the western end of the Warrigal Road rail overpass, which provides station access.

The station consists of two platforms, in an [[Island platform|island format]], with a large weatherboard building at the [[Glen Waverley railway station|Glen Waverley]] end of the station. A large [[Metcard]] ticket vending machine is located at the entrance to the platforms, which is able to dispense most ticketing options available and also accept notes and coins. A coin-only Metcard ticket vending machine and ticket office sits beside. An underpass is situated at the Glen Waverley end of the station. [[Myki]] readers and recharge machines are also installed at the station, in anticipation of the future replacement of the Metcard ticketing system. Due to curved track and platform, the centre of the platform is usually about 20&amp;amp;nbsp;cm from the train.

[[Holmesglen Institute of TAFE]] is located south of the station.
