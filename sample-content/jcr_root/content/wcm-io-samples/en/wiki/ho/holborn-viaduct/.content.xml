&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Holborn Viaduct&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a road bridge in [[London]] and the name of the street which crosses it (which forms part of the [[A40 road]]). It links [[Holborn]], via [[Holborn Circus]], with [[Newgate|Newgate Street]] in the [[City of London]], passing over Farringdon Street and the subterranean [[River Fleet]].

It was built between 1863 and 1869, at a cost of over Â£2 million, and was the first [[overpass|flyover]] in [[central London]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;A Dictionary of London&amp;quot;, by Henry A Harben, published 1918, http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63171&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It replaced a much older structure; Holborn Bridge, which crossed the River Fleet already culverted to the Thames a century earlier.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=511 |title=Engineering timelines - Holborn Viaduct |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The viaduct spanned the steep-sided Holborn Hill and the River Fleet valley at a length of 1,400&amp;amp;nbsp;ft, and 80&amp;amp;nbsp;ft wide. City surveyor [[William Haywood (engineer)|William Haywood]] was the architect, engineer was [[Rowland Mason Ordish]],&amp;lt;ref name=Curl&amp;gt;{{cite web|last=Curl|first=James Stevens|title=Ordish, Rowland Mason|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O1-OrdishRowlandMason.html|work=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and it was opened by [[Queen Victoria]] at the same time as [[Blackfriars Bridge]].

Four statues on the parapets represent [[commerce]] and [[agriculture]] on the south side, both by sculptor Henry Bursill, and [[science]] and [[fine art]] on the north side, by the sculpture firm [[Farmer &amp;amp; Brindley]]. Staircases provide pedestrian access from the bridge to Farringdon Street below.

Nearby was [[Holborn Viaduct railway station]], now replaced by the [[City Thameslink railway station]] at [[Ludgate Circus]].
