&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hollywood&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a village in the [[Bromsgrove (district)|Bromsgrove district]] of [[Worcestershire]], England, contiguous with and to the south of the city of [[Birmingham]]. The village lies within the ward of Hollywood and Majors Green&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/ward/1308627198/report.aspx |title=Office for National Statistics ward maps: Hollywood |format= |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worcestershire.gov.uk/cms/pdf/Census_Wards_BardsBromsHollywood.pdf |title=Worcestershire County Council Ward Profile |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-21}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and is located within the civil parish of [[Wythall]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worcestershire.gov.uk/cms/images/Census_OldParish_Wythall.jpg |title=Worcestershire County Council Historic Parish Maps: Wythall|format=JPG |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The eastern part of the village is also known as Trueman&amp;apos;s Heath.

==History==
Until the 1950s, Hollywood was a rural area with many fields and farms. Extensive postwar development saw these fields and farms give way to housing estates, shops and schools.

==Geography==
Hollywood is served by the [[A435 road|A435 Alcester Road]], and is adjacent to [[Highter&amp;apos;s Heath]] to the north and Drakes Cross to the south. Other settlements close by include [[Wythall]], [[Kings Heath]], [[Kings Norton]], [[Shirley, West Midlands|Shirley]] and [[Dickens Heath]].

==Amenities==
&amp;lt;!-- Given the size of this section, I have opted to use a catch all Amenities term, rather than separate headings for schools etc. When expanded it should follow [[Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography/How to write about settlements]] --&amp;gt;
Hollywood is home to the Gay Hill Golf Club, which has existed since 1921, and a family owned and managed packaging company, [http://www.kilby.co.uk/ Kilby Packaging], which has existed since 1946. The village is served by several schools located immediately outside the ward boundary - Hollywood Primary School is located over the county border within the Highter&amp;apos;s Heath area of the city of Birmingham, whilst the Coppice Primary School and Woodrush High School are just within the Drakes Cross ward.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/ward/1308627194/report.aspx |title=Office for National Statistics ward maps: Drakes Cross |format= |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
