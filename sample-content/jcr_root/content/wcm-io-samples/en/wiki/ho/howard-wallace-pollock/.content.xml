&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Howard Wallace Pollock&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 11, 1920 – January 9, 2011)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://newsminer.com/bookmark/10975591-Howard-Pollock-Alaska-s-2nd-congressman-dies-at-90&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was an [[United States|American]] politician and [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] Representative from [[Alaska]].

Pollock was born in [[Chicago]] and went to school in [[Perkinston, Mississippi]]. He studied [[law]] at the [[Santa Clara University|University of Santa Clara]] in [[California]] and at the [[University of Houston]], [[Texas]], and then did some postgraduate studies at the [[MIT]], where he got a [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in industrial management. He was a practicing attorney.

He enlisted as a seaman in the [[United States Navy]] in 1941 and retired with rank of [[lieutenant commander]] in 1946.

Pollock served in the Alaska Territorial Legislature 1953–1955. He later served in the [[Alaska Senate]] 1961–1963 and 1965–1966; and was elected as a Republican to the Ninetieth and Ninety-first [[United States Congress|Congress]]es (January 3, 1967 – January 3, 1971). He was not a candidate for reelection in 1970 to the Ninety-second Congress, but rather was an unsuccessful candidate for Republican  nomination for Governor of Alaska. Pollock was also a past president of the [[National Rifle Association]].

From 1998 until his death in January 2011 Pollock was a resident of [[Arlington, Virginia]].
