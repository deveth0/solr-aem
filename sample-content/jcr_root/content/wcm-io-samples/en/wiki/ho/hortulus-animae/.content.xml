&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hortulus Animae&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-en|Little Garden of the Soul}}, {{lang-de|Seelengärtlein}}, {{lang-fr|Jardin des Âmes}}, {{lang-pl|Raj duszny}}) was the Latin title of a prayer book also available in German. It was very popular in the early sixteenth century, printed in many versions, also abroad in [[Lyon]]s and [[Kraków]].

An earlier well-known work of devotion and of moral instruction, richly illustrated with stories, was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;Der Selen Würtzgart&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, first printed at [[Ulm]] in 1483. The title, &amp;quot;Herb garden of the Soul&amp;quot;, is similar to later titles.

The first known edition of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hortulus Animae&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, dated 13 March 1498, was printed at [[Strassburg]] by [[Wilhelm Schaffener]] of [[Rappoltsweiler]], with German versions appearing in 1501. Later editions contained woodcuts by the well-known engravers [[Hans Springinklee]] and [[Erhard Schön]], with beautiful miniatures in some existing manuscript examples, like the one at [[Vienna]] (Cod. Bibl. Pal. Vindobonensis. 2706, 1907), which has been reproduced as facsimile by [[Friedrich Dornhöffer]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hortulus Animae polonice&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a Polish version written by [[Biernat of Lublin]], printed and published in 1513 by [[Florian Ungler]] in [[Kraków]], is believed to be the first book printed in the [[Polish language]]. The last known copy was lost during [[World War II]].

The work is mentioned briefly at the end of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]&amp;apos;s short story &amp;quot;[[The Man of the Crowd]].&amp;quot;
