&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Holten&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Dutch Low Saxon]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hooltn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a small village in the municipality of [[Rijssen-Holten]] in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] province of [[Overijssel]], with approximately 10,000 inhabitants. Holten is located in a forested area just south of the [[Holterberg]], a hill that is about 65m high, and is part of the &amp;quot;Sallandse Heuvelrug&amp;quot; [[National Park]]. The National Park is the only area in the Netherlands in which the black [[grouse]] (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;korhoen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) can be found. This grouse population is on the brink of extinction, so parts of the National Park are closed to the public during its breeding season.

In Holten is the Netherlands&amp;apos; second-largest [[World War II]] cemetery, holding the remains of mostly Canadian casualties of war. This cemetery is located about 3&amp;amp;nbsp;km north-east of the Holten railroad station, in the woods. The cemetery is accessible by car through a number of sand roads.

The scenic location of Holten has stimulated considerable tourism in the village, which is accommodated by a number of commendable hotels and camp sites. During the summer, the number of tourists exceeds the number of locals.

Holten has a railway station on the [[Deventer]]-[[Almelo]] railway line ([[Holten railway station]]), which is served twice per hour.

Holten is the home village of Olympic [[Speed skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics#Men&amp;apos;s events|1500m speed skating]] gold medalist [[Mark Tuitert]], [[jazz]] [[trombonist]] [[Wolter Wierbos]], and film and [[documentary film|documentary]] [[film director|director]] and [[Academy Award]] winner [[Bert Haanstra]].

==Dialect==
As well as [[Standard Dutch]], the local inhabitants speak a variety of [[Dutch Low Saxon]], which is considered to be a member of the [[Sallaans|Sallaands]] sub-dialect, with a few [[Tweants]] traits that are a natural result of the village&amp;apos;s proximity to [[Tweante]]. While in surrounding communities dialect use is relatively widespread, Holten has seen a decline over the past few decades.

==Notable Residents==
