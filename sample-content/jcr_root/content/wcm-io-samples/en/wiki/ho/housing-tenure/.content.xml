&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Housing tenure&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refers to the financial arrangements under which someone has the right to live in a [[house]] or [[apartment]].  The most frequent forms are [[leasehold estate|tenancy]], in which [[renting|rent]] is paid to a [[landlord]], and [[owner-occupier|owner occupancy]].  Mixed forms of tenure are also possible.

The basic forms of tenure can be subdivided, for example an owner-occupier may own a house outright, or it may be [[Mortgage law|mortgaged]].  In the case of tenancy, the landlord may be a private individual, a [[non-profit organization]] such as a [[housing association]], or a government body, as in [[public housing]].

[[Statistical survey|Survey]]s used in [[social science]] research frequently include questions about housing tenure, because it is a useful [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] for income or wealth, and people are less reluctant to give information about it.

==Types==

* [[Owner-occupier|Owner occupancy]] – The person or group that occupies a [[house]] owns the building (and usually the land on which it sits).

* [[Leasehold estate|Tenancy]] – A [[landlord]] who owns an apartment or building [[renting|rents]] the right to occupy the unit to a [[leasehold estate|tenant]].

* [[Housing cooperative|Cooperative]] – Ownership of the entire building or complex is held in common by a [[homeowners&amp;apos; association]].  Individuals have the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;right&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to occupy a particular apartment by mutual agreement but do not hold exclusive ownership to it.

* [[Condominium]] (a.k.a. [[commonhold]] and [[strata title]]) – Ownership of an apartment or house is assigned to an individual, but common areas (e.g. hallways, heating system, elevators, exterior areas) are controlled by the [[homeowners&amp;apos; association]].  Fees are charged to the condo owners for maintenance of the common areas. These are referred to as &amp;quot;condo fees&amp;quot;.

* [[Public housing]] – Government-owned housing, whether provided for free or leased at a subsidised rate.

* [[Squatting]] – Occupation by non-owner without permission by the owner, if any.

* [[Land trust]] – Often used as an alternative to ownership for privacy and legal reasons.

==Styles and variations==

* [[Timeshare]] – A modified form of cooperative, condominium, or leased house or apartment, with short-term residency right agreements tailored for [[Tourism|vacations]].

* [[Cohousing]] – A variant of a condominium or cooperative with a high degree of interaction with neighbors in shared areas.

==United Kingdom==

The [[Department for Communities and Local Government (UK)|Department for Communities and Local Government]] is a [[UK government]] department responsible for developing government housing policy in England.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/about/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;   The English Housing Survey &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/19372481.pdf&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; classifies all dwellings into one of four housing tenure classifications:

* [[Owner occupied]]
* [[Private rented]]
* [[Rented from local authorities]]
* Rented from [[housing association]]
