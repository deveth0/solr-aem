A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;horizontal blank interrupt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also called [[Raster interrupt]]) is a programming technique used in some systems, notably [[video game]]s and consoles, to allow [[computer program|program]] code to be run in the periods when the display hardware is turned off, waiting for the [[Television|TV]] to complete its [[horizontal blank]], which takes about 10 μS.

The technique was only really useful before the entire display could be addressed directly with high speed [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] attached to large [[frame buffer]]s, that is, in the days of [[8-bit]] systems. In this case the CPU was not terribly fast, and that 10 μS might be enough to run perhaps 40 to 60 instructions. That was enough to change a few registers in the display hardware however, which is why this technique was useful.

For instance, both the [[Bally Astrocade]] and [[Atari 8-bit family]] (originally intended to be a console) included HBI support. (Atari refers to HBI as &amp;quot;[[Display List Interrupts]]&amp;quot; as this feature is directly connected to the [[ANTIC]] graphics chip&amp;apos;s [[Display list|Display List]] feature.) The [[Bally Astrocade]] could display only four colors per pixel per display line.  The [[Atari 8-bit family]] could display four or five colors per playfield graphics mode line and up to nine colors when adding Player/Missile graphics or when using GTIA graphics mode 10 (the BASIC/OS mode number).  But both systems used &amp;quot;graphics indirection&amp;quot; where each playfield color is represented by a hardware register allowing those playfield colors to be selected from a palette of 256.   By changing the values of the color registers during the HBI, the systems could select a new set of colors on every line, leading to a number of &amp;quot;rainbow&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;gradient&amp;quot; displays with all 256 colors on screen.
