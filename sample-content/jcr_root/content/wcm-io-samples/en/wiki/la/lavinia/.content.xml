{{Other uses|Lavinia (disambiguation)}}
In [[Roman mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lavinia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-la|Lāuīnĭa}}) is the daughter of [[Latinus]] and [[Amata]] and the last wife of [[Aeneas]].

Lavinia, the only child of the king and &amp;quot;ripe for marriage&amp;quot;, had been courted by many [[Ausones|men in Ausonia]] who hoped to become the king of [[Latium]]. [[Turnus]], ruler of the [[Rutuli]], was the most likely of the suitors, having the favor of Queen Amata. King Latinus is later warned by his father [[Faunus]] in a [[dream oracle]] that his daughter is not to marry a [[Latini|Latin]].

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Propose no Latin alliance for your daughter,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Son of mine; distrust the bridal chamber&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Now prepared. Men from abroad will come&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
And be your sons by marriage. Blood so mingled&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Lifts our name starward. Children of that stock&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Will see all earth turned Latin at their feet,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Governed by them, as far as on his rounds&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
The Sun looks down on Ocean, East or West.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aeneid&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 7.96–101, as translated by [[Robert Fitzgerald]].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

Lavinia has what is perhaps her most, or only, memorable moment in Book 7 of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Aeneid]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, lines 69–83: during sacrifice at the altars of the gods, Lavinia&amp;apos;s hair catches fire, an omen promising glorious days to come for Lavinia and war for all Latins.

Aeneas and Lavinia had one son, [[Silvius (mythology)|Silvius]]. Aeneas named the city [[Lavinium]] for her.  According to an account by [[Livy]], [[Ascanius]] was the son of Aeneas and Lavinia; and she ruled the [[Latins]] as a [[power behind the throne]], for [[Ascanius]] was too young to rule.

== In other works ==
In [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]&amp;apos;s 2008 novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Lavinia (novel)|Lavinia]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the character of Lavinia and her relationship with Aeneas is expanded and elaborated, giving insight into the life of a king&amp;apos;s daughter in ancient Italy. Le Guin employs a self-conscious narrative device in having Lavinia as the first-person narrator know that she would not have a life without [[Virgil]], who, being the writer of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aeneid&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is thus her creator.

Lavinia, in Shakespeare&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Titus Andronicus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is the daughter of Titus, and is raped and butchered by the sons of the Gothic queen.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Andronicus#Characters&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Lavinia also appears with her father Latinus in [[Dante]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Divine Comedy]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Inferno&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Canto IV, lines 125–126.
