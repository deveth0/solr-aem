{{French literature sidebar}}
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;lais&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of Marie de France&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are a series of twelve short narrative [[Breton lai]]s by the poet [[Marie de France]]. They are written in the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and were probably composed in the late 12th century. The short, narrative poems generally focus on glorifying the concept of [[courtly love]] through the adventures of their main characters. Despite her stature in [[Anglo-Norman literature]] and [[medieval French literature]] generally, little is known of Marie herself, though it is thought that she was born in [[France]] and wrote in [[England]].

Marie de France&amp;apos;s lais, told in [[Syllable|octosyllabic]], or eight syllable verse, are notable for their celebration of love, individuality of character, and vividness of description – hallmarks of the emerging literature of the times. Five different [[manuscripts]] contain one or more of the lais, but only one, Harley 978, a thirteenth-century manuscript housed in the [[British Library]], preserves all twelve. It has been suggested that if the author had indeed arranged the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lais&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as presented in Harley 978, that she may have chosen this overall structure to contrast the positive and negative actions that can result from love.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Ferrante53&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Ferrante, Joan M. &amp;quot;A New History of French Literature,&amp;quot; p. 53, Edited by Denis Hollier. Harvard University Press, 1994&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In this manuscript, the odd lais — &amp;quot;[[Guigemar]],&amp;quot; &amp;quot;[[Le Fresne (lais)|Le Fresne]],&amp;quot; etc. — praise the characters who express love for other people.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Ferrante53&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; By comparison, the even lais, such as &amp;quot;[[Equitan]],&amp;quot; &amp;quot;[[Bisclavret]]&amp;quot; and so on, warn how love that is limited to oneself can lead to misfortune.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Ferrante53&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

The Harley 978 manuscript also includes a 56-line [[prologue]] in which Marie describes the impetus for her composition of the lais. In the prologue, Marie writes that she was inspired by the example of the ancient [[Ancient Greek literature|Greeks]] and [[Latin literature|Romans]] to create something that would be both entertaining and morally instructive. She also states her desire to preserve for posterity the tales that she has heard. Two of Marie&amp;apos;s lais – &amp;quot;[[Lanval]],&amp;quot; a very popular work that was adapted several times over the years (including the [[Middle English]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sir Launfal]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), and &amp;quot;[[Chevrefoil]]&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;The [[Honeysuckle]]&amp;quot;), a short composition about [[Tristan and Iseult]] – mention [[King Arthur]] and his [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Marie&amp;apos;s lais were precursors to later works on the subject, and Marie was probably a contemporary of [[Chrétien de Troyes]], another writer of Arthurian tales.
