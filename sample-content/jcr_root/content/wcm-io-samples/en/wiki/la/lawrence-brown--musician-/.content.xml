&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lawrence Brown&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (August 3, 1907&amp;amp;nbsp;– September 5, 1988) was an acclaimed [[jazz]] [[trombonist]] from [[Kansas]] who achieved recognition with the [[Duke Ellington]] orchestra.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p8154/biography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic biography]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Brown worked throughout his career as a [[session musician]] as well as recording his own solo efforts.

==Biography==
He began his career with [[Charlie Echols]] and [[Paul Howard (musician)|Paul Howard]]. In 1932 he joined [[Duke Ellington]]. His great technical command of the instrument, with its &amp;quot;creamy tone, neurotic [[vibrato]] and range&amp;quot; was featured with Ellington&amp;apos;s band every year in compositions such as &amp;quot;Blue Cellophane&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Golden Cress.&amp;quot;

Brown left Ellington&amp;apos;s band in 1951 to join a band led by former Ellington [[sideman]] [[Johnny Hodges]], where he stayed until 1955. After leaving Hodges, Brown took a position for five years with [[CBS]] as a [[session musician|session player]]. In 1960, Brown rejoined Ellington and stayed with him until 1970. After leaving Ellington&amp;apos;s band the second time at age 63, Brown quit performing completely.

Brown fulfilled many roles in the Ellington Orchestra—as a [[ballad]]eer, technical [[Solo (music)|soloist]], and section leader. His highly melodic ballad playing as well as his fast technical style inspired [[trombone|trombonists]] from [[Tommy Dorsey]] to [[Bill Harris (musician)|Bill Harris]].

Brown was married to actress [[Fredi Washington]].  He died in Los Angeles, California.
