==History==
Lamport consisted of two ancient [[Manorialism|manor]]s, one of which was owned by the priory of [[Oseney]] and passed to Stowe; the other seems to have belonged to [[Luffield Abbey]], whose estate had passed, by 1350, to a family named after the hamlet, and subsequently passed by marriage, in 1416, to the Dayrells (whose name continues in the village name of [[Lillingstone Dayrell]].&amp;lt;ref name=uki /&amp;gt; It was annexed to Stowe to provide homes for the staff and [[servant (domestic)|servants]] of the new [[manor house]] there{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}.

In 1637, Peter Temple enclosed land around Lamport for his deer park. This aggrieved the Dayrells, who owned some of the enclosed land. A dispute, occasionally violent, ensued and eventually led to litigation in 1640 and a petition to Parliament. Notwithstanding the Dayrells&amp;apos; resistance, the village&amp;apos;s continued to be enclosed and it was abandoned sometime after 1739.&amp;lt;ref name=fisk /&amp;gt;
