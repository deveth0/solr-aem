A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;landform&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the [[earth sciences]] comprises a [[geomorphology|geomorphological]] unit, and is largely defined by its surface form and location in the landscape, as part of the [[terrain]], and as such, is typically an element of [[topography]]. Landform elements also include [[seascape]] and oceanic [[waterbody]] interface features such as [[bay]]s, [[peninsula]]s, [[sea]]s and so forth, including sub-aqueous terrain features such as [[mid-ocean ridge]]s, [[volcano]]es, and the great [[ocean basin]]s.

==Physical characteristics==
Landforms are categorized by characteristic physical attributes such as elevation, slope, orientation, [[Stratum|stratification]], rock exposure, and soil type.

Gross &amp;apos;&amp;apos;physical features or landforms include intuitive elements such as [[berm]]s, [[mound]]s, [[hill]]s, [[ridge]]s, [[cliff]]s, [[valley]]s, [[river]]s, [[peninsula]]s and numerous other structural and size-scaled (i.e. [[pond]]s vs. [[lake]]s, [[hill]]s vs. [[mountain]]s) elements including various kinds of inland and oceanic [[Waterbody|waterbodies]] and sub-surface features.

{{wide image|Cades Cove Panorama.JPG|600px|This panorama in [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] has the readily identifiable &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;physical features&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of a rolling [[plain]], actually part of a broad [[valley]], distant [[hill|foothills]], and a backdrop of the old, much [[weathering|weathered]] [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian mountain range]]}}

==Hierarchy of classes==
[[Ocean]]s and [[continent]]s exemplify the highest-order landforms. [[Landform element]]s are parts of a high-order landforms that can be further identified and systematically given a cohesive definition such as hill-tops, shoulders, saddles, foreslopes and backslopes.

Some generic landform elements including: pits, peaks, channels, ridges, passes, pools and plains, may be extracted from a [[digital elevation model]] using some automated techniques where the data has been gathered by modern satellites and [[stereoscopic]] [[aerial photography|aerial surveillance]] cameras.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/research/cires/banff/pubpapers/198/ |title=Conference paper: &amp;quot;Automated landform classification using DEMs&amp;quot;|accessdate=2008-06-26|author=Robert A. MacMillan, David H. McNabb, R. Keith Jones|date=September 2000}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Until recently, compiling the data found in such data sets required time consuming and expensive techniques of many man-hours.

[[Terrain]] (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;relief&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is the third or vertical dimension of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;land surface&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. [[Topography]] is the study of terrain, although the word is often used as a synonym for relief itself. When relief is described [[underwater]], the term [[bathymetry]] is used. In [[cartography]], many [[Cartographic relief depiction|different techniques]] are used to describe relief, including [[contour line]]s and TIN ([[Triangulated irregular network]]).

Elementary landforms (segments, facets, relief units) are the smallest homogeneous divisions of the land surface, at the given scale/resolution. These are areas with relatively homogenous [[morphometric]] properties, bounded by lines of discontinuity. A plateau or a hill can be observed at various scales ranging from few hundred meters to hundreds of kilometers. Hence, the spatial distribution of landforms is often scale-dependent as is the case for soils and geological strata.

A number of factors, ranging from [[plate tectonics]] to [[erosion]] and [[deposition (sediment)|deposition]], can generate and affect landforms. [[biology|Biological]] factors can also influence landformsâ€” for example, note the role of [[vegetation]] in the development of [[dune]] systems and [[salt marsh]]es, and the work of [[coral]]s and [[alga]]e in the formation of [[reef|coral reefs]].

Landforms do not include man-made features, such as [[canal]]s, [[port]]s and many [[harbor]]s; and geographic features, such as [[desert]]s, [[forest]]s, [[grassland]]s, and impact [[Impact crater|craters]].

Many of the terms are not restricted to refer to features of the planet [[Earth]], and can be used to describe surface features of other planets and similar objects in the [[Universe]]. Examples are mountains, hills, polar caps, and valleys, which are found on all of the [[terrestrial planets]].
