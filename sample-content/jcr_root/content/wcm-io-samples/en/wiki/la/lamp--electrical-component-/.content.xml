A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;lamp&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a replaceable component such as an [[incandescent light bulb]], which is designed to produce [[light]] from [[electricity]]. These components usually have a base of ceramic, metal, glass or plastic, which makes an electrical connection in the socket of a [[light fixture]]. This connection may be made with a screw-thread base, two metal pins, two metal caps or a bayonet cap. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Re-lamping&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the replacement of only the removable lamp in a light fixture.

==Lamp circuit symbols==
