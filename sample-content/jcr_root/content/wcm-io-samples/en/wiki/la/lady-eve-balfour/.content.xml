&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lady Evelyn Barbara &amp;quot;Eve&amp;quot; Balfour&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1899-1990) was an [[England|English]] farmer, educator, [[organic farming]] pioneer, and a founding figure in the [[organic movement]]. She was one of the first women to study agriculture at an English university, graduating from the [[University of Reading]].

The daughter of the [[Gerald Balfour, 2nd Earl of Balfour|second Earl of Balfour]], she began farming in 1920, in [[Haughley Green]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]]. In 1939, with her friend and neighbor Ryan Nelson, she launched the [[Haughley Experiment]], the first long-term, side-by-side [[scientific]] comparison of organic and [[conventional agriculture|chemical-based farming]].

In 1943, she published the organics classic, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Living Soil]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a book combining her research with the initial findings at Haughley. She then started a series of lectures and talks based around farmers markets and cattle sales, often joined in [[Wales]] by Dinah Williams, who founded the first organic dairy farm that today is the feed farm for [[Rachel&amp;apos;s Organic]] [[dairy produce]].&amp;lt;ref name=Times6847838&amp;gt;{{cite news | title=The Soil Association | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6847838.ece | work=The Times | location=London | date=2009-09-25 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1946, she co-founded and became the first president of the [[Soil Association]], an international organization claiming to promote [[sustainable agriculture]] (and the main [[organic farming]] association in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] today). She continued to farm, write and lecture for the rest of her life, including a year-long tour throughout [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] during which she met Australian organic farming pioneers including Henry Shoobridge, president of the [[Living Soil Association of Tasmania]] which was the first association to affiliate with the [[Soil Association]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://ora.ouls.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid%3A8ec8fe88-d33a-4205-b1cd-2d48a32cba71/datastreams/ATTACHMENT01 &amp;quot;The Soil Association and Australia: From Mother Earth to Eve Balfour&amp;quot;], Mother Earth, v.4 (Spring): 13-17.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
