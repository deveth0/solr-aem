&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Latinus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-la|Lătīnŭs}}) was a figure in both [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]].

==Greek mythology==
In [[Hesiod]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Theogony]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Lines 1011-1016.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Latinus was the son of [[Odysseus]] and [[Circe]] who ruled the [[Tyrrhenians|Tyrsenoi]], presumably the [[Etruscans]], with his brothers [[Ardeas]] and [[Telegonus]]. Latinus is also referred to, by much later authors, as the son of [[Pandora II]] and brother of [[Graecus]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/Zeus.html Parada, Carlos. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Greek Mythology Link&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. &amp;quot;Zeus&amp;quot; (1997).]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; although according to Hesiod, Graecus had three brothers, [[Hellen]], [[Magnesia Prefecture|Magnitas]], and [[Macedon]] with the first being the father of [[Dorus|Doros]], [[Xuthus|Xuthos]], and [[Aeolos]].

==Roman mythology==
In later [[Roman mythology]] (notably [[Virgil|Virgil&amp;apos;s]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Aeneid]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), Latinus, or Lavinius, was a king of the [[Latins]]. He is sometimes described as the son of [[Faunus]] and [[Marica (mythology)|Marica]], and father of [[Lavinia]] with his wife, [[Amata]]. He hosted Aeneas&amp;apos;s army of exiled [[Trojan War|Trojans]] and offered them the option of reorganizing their life in [[Latium]]. His wife Amata wished his daughter Lavinia to be betrothed to [[Turnus]], king of the [[Rutuli]], but Faunus and the gods insisted that he give her instead to [[Aeneas]]; Turnus consequently declared war on Aeneas and was killed two weeks into the conflict. [[Ascanius]], the son of Aeneas, later founded [[Alba Longa]] and was the first in a long series of kings leading to [[Romulus]] and [[Remus]], the founders of [[Rome]] all the way down to [[Julius Caesar]].       This version is not properly compatible with the Greek one: the Trojan War had ended only eight years earlier, and Odysseus only met Circe a couple of months later, so any son of the pair could only be seven years old, whereas the Roman Latinus had an adult daughter by this time.
