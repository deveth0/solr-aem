&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;LaMarcus Adna Thompson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (March 8, 1848 &amp;amp;ndash; May 8, 1919) was an American [[inventor]] and [[businessman]] most famous for developing many highly enjoyable gravity rides.

==Early years==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
Thompson was born in Jersey, Licking County, Ohio on March 8, 1848. In his adolescence he became a skilled carpenter. In 1873 he began operating a grocery store in [[Elkhart, Indiana]]. There he began designing a device to manufacture seamless hosiery. He made a fortune in that business, but failing health forced him to quit it.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=L. A.

Thompson is best known for his early work developing [[roller coaster]]s, and is sometimes called the &amp;quot;Father of the Gravity Ride&amp;quot;.  He did not invent the roller coaster. The [[history of the roller coaster]] dates back to at least the 17th century, and [[John G. Taylor (inventor)|John G. Taylor]] obtained an earlier patent under the name &amp;quot;Inclined Railway&amp;quot;; however, over his lifetime, Thompson accumulated nearly thirty [[patents]] related to roller coaster technologies. An example is the patent granted 22 Dec. 1885 for the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gravity Switch-back Railway&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=cSc_AAAAEBAJ |title=Google patents, US patent# 332762, &amp;apos;&amp;amp;#39;GRAVITY SWITCH-BACK RAILWAY&amp;apos;&amp;amp;#39; |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-13}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Thompson&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gravity Pleasure [[Switchback Railway]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; opened at [[Coney Island]] in 1884. A (6&amp;amp;nbsp;mph) ride cost 5 cents. Eventually he built many more, both in the U.S. and in Europe. In 1887, along with designer James A. Griffiths, he opened the [[Scenic Railway#Scenic gravity railroads|Scenic Railway]] on the Boardwalk in Atlantic City, N.J.

He was managing director of the L. A. Thompson Scenic Railway Company, 220 West 42nd St., incorporated in 1895.

He died at his home, Thompson Park, [[Glen Cove, Long Island]], on May 8, 1919 aged 71.
