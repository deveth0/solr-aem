&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lake Torrens National Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a national park in [[South Australia]], 345&amp;amp;nbsp;km north of [[Adelaide]].

==Environment==

===Geology===
[[Lake Torrens]] is a 5,700 square kilometre [[endorheic]] saline [[Rift (geology)|rift]] lake in [[South Australia]],and is located in southern Australia. It forms part of the same rift valley that includes [[Spencer Gulf]] to the south and is approximately 240&amp;amp;nbsp;km long. It is in the Lake Torrens National Park, and a permit is required to visit. Lake Torrens is usually a dry salt flat. It has been filled with water only once in the past 150 years - in 1989.

===Birds===
The lake has been identified by [[BirdLife International]] as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) because it supported up to 100,000 breeding [[Banded Stilt]]s during the major filling event of 1989.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Lake Torrens |accessdate=2011-08-01 |work= Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  It may occasionally support over 1% of the world population of [[Red-capped Plover]]s.  [[Cinnamon Quail-thrush]]es are also common in the IBA.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Lake Torrens. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 01/08/2011.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
[[Eyre&amp;apos;s 1839 expeditions|Discovered]] by [[Edward John Eyre]] in 1839, for the following twenty years it was believed that Lake Torrens was an enormous horseshoe-shaped saltpan encircling the northern [[Flinders Ranges]] and blocking any path to the interior. The first European to penetrate the mythical barrier was [[A. C. Gregory]] from the north in March 1858; later the same year, an expedition under [[B. H. Babbage]] and [[Peter Egerton Warburton|Major Warburton]] in the north-west also crossed the non-existent barrier near modern [[Marree, South Australia|Marree]]. Eyre&amp;apos;s horseshoe lake was actually composed of [[Lake Frome]], [[Lake Callabonna]], [[Lake Blanche]], [[Lake Gregory (South Australia)|Lake Gregory]], [[Lake Eyre|Lake Eyre South]], and Lake Torrens itself.
