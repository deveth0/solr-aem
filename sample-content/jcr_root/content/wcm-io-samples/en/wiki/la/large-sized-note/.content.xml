A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;large-sized note&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a bill of any [[denomination (currency)|denomination]] of [[United States dollar|U.S. currency]] printed between 1863 and 1929. This is in contrast with small-sized notes, which were printed starting in 1928. Large-sized notes exist in denominations of $1 through $10,000. The most common large-sized notes are the Federal Reserve Notes of Series 1914 and 1918. These are detailed below, but are only a subset of all large-sized notes made by the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] (BEP).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

A large-sized note can also refer to a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;large-denomination&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; banknote in various currencies.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
