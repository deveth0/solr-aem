The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lake Washington Ship Canal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which runs through the City of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], connects the fresh water body of [[Lake Washington]] with the salt water inland sea of [[Puget Sound]]. The [[Hiram M. Chittenden Locks]] accommodate the approximately 20-foot difference in water level between Lake Washington and the Sound.  The Canal runs east/west, and connects [[Union Bay (Seattle)|Union Bay]], [[Lake Union]], the [[Montlake Cut]], [[Portage Bay]], the [[Fremont Cut]], [[Salmon Bay]], and [[Shilshole Bay]], with the Sound, which empties into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The project began in 1911 and was officially completed in 1934.  Prior to construction of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, otherwise known as the Salmon Bay Waterway, water used to exit Lake Washington via the Black River which flowed from the south end of Lake Washington into the Duwamish River.

As early as 1854, there was discussion of building a navigable connection between the Lake Washington and Puget Sound for the purpose of transporting logs, milled lumber, and fishing vessels. Thirteen years later, the [[United States Navy]] endorsed a canal project, which included a plan for building a naval shipyard on Lake Washington. In 1891 the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] started planning the project. Some preliminary work was begun in 1906, and work began in earnest five years later. The delays in canal planning and construction resulted in the U.S. Navy building the [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington]], which is located across the Sound from Seattle.

The Canal&amp;apos;s crossings, from east to west, are:
* the [[Montlake Bridge]] carrying [[Montlake Boulevard]] over the [[Montlake Cut]],
* the [[University Bridge (Seattle)|University Bridge]] carrying [[Eastlake Avenue]] over [[Portage Bay]],
* the [[Ship Canal Bridge]] carrying [[Interstate 5 (Washington)|Interstate 5]] over [[Portage Bay]],
* the [[George Washington Memorial Bridge]] (commonly called the [[Aurora Bridge]]) carrying Aurora Avenue N. ([[Washington State Route 99|State Route 99]]) over the west end of [[Lake Union]],
* the [[Fremont Bridge (Seattle)|Fremont Bridge]] connecting 4th Avenue N. to Fremont Avenue N. over the [[Fremont Cut]],
* the [[Ballard Bridge]] carrying 15th Avenue over [[Salmon Bay]],
* pedestrian crossing only at the [[Hiram M. Chittenden Locks]],
* the [[BNSF Railway]]&amp;apos;s [[Salmon Bay Bridge]] over [[Salmon Bay]].

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lake Washington Ship Canal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hiram M. Chittenden Locks&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The [[Montlake Cut]], along with the [[Montlake Bridge]] are [[List of landmarks in Seattle|City of Seattle Designated Landmarks]] (ID #107995).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[https://www.cityofseattle.gov/neighborhoods/preservation/m.htm Landmarks Alphabetical Listing for M], Individual Landmarks, Department of Neighborhoods, City of Seattle.
