This riot concluded in one death and about sixty arrests.

==Background==

Chicago&amp;apos;s rapid growth in the 1840s and 50s was due in large part to German and Irish Catholic immigrants.  These immigrants settled in their own neighborhoods, German immigrants congregating mainly on the North Side, across the Chicago River from City Hall and the older, Protestant part of the city.  The German settlers worked a six-day week, leaving Sunday as their primary day to socialize; much of this socialization took place in the small taverns that dotted the North Side.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;GregSmith&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; German-language newspapers, the [[Turners]], and German craft unions gave the German population of Chicago a high degree of political cohesiveness;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The German-American radical press: the shaping of a left political culture ...  By Elliott Shore, Ken Fones-Wolf, James Philip Danky&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; the [[Forty-Eighters]] among them were used to demonstrations as a political tool.

As in much of the rest of the country, distrust of Catholic  influence produced a backlash in the form of the “Know-Nothing” movement.  In the election of 1854, the [[Temperance Party]] candidate, Amos Throop, lost by nearly 20% points to [[Isaac Lawrence Milliken]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | last = Walker | first = Thomas | title = Chicago Mayor 1854 | work = Our Campaigns | date = 11-04-2008 | url = http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=486033 | accessdate = 06-06-2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Nevertheless, after winning the election, Milliken declared himself in favor of temperance as well.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Richard Lawrence | title = Lincoln and His World: The Path to the Presidency, 1854-1860 | publisher = McFarland Press | year = 2012 | location = Jefferson, NC | pages = 64 | ISBN = 0786459298}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Milliken lost the following year to Levi Boone, the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] candidate. Boone, a [[Baptists|Baptist]] and [[Temperance movement in Illinois|temperance]] advocate, believed that the Sabbath was profaned by having drinking establishments open on Sunday.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;BooneSpeech&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.chipublib.org/cplbooksmovies/cplarchive/mayors/boone_inaug.php Inauguration Speech of Levi D. Boone]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Boone&amp;apos;s actions were in anticipation of Illinois enacting by referendum a [[Maine law]] that would prohibit the sale of alcohol for recreational purposes.  The referendum failed in June 1855, by a statewide vote of 54% to 46%.
