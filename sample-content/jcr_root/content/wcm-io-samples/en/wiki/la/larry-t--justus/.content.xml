&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Larry T. Justus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (died 20 October 2002) was a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] member of the [[North Carolina House of Representatives]] from [[Hendersonville, North Carolina]]; he served for nine consecutive terms. Justus was seeking re-election for a tenth term in the General Assembly when he died in late October 2002. Because his name remained on the ballot and he received a majority of votes cast, his widow, [[Carolyn K. Justus]], was named by the local Republican party to fill his seat in the House of Representatives during his tenth term.
