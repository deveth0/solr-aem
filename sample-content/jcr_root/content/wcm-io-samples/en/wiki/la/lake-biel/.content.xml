&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lake Biel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lake Bienne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[German language|German]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bielersee&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[French language|French]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lac de Bienne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[lake]] in the west of [[Switzerland]]. Together with [[Lake Murten|Lake Morat]] and [[Lake Neuchâtel]], it is one of the three large lakes in the [[Jura mountains|Jura]] region of Switzerland. It lies approximately at {{coord|47|5|N|7|10|E|type:waterbody_region:CH|name=Lake Biel}}, at the language boundary between German &amp;amp; French speaking areas.

The lake is 15&amp;amp;nbsp;km long and up to 4.1&amp;amp;nbsp;km wide. Its surface area is [[1 E7 m²|39.3 km²]], the maximum depth 74 m. The lake is located at 429 metres above sea level.

Lake Biel has a catchment area of about [[1 E9 m²|8,305 km²]]. Water remains in the lake for an average of 58 days. The river [[Aare]], the river [[Zihl]]/[[Thielle]] flowing from Lake Neuchâtel, the [[Twannbach]] draining water down from the surplombing first Jura mountain range and the river [[Suze (river)|Suze]] draining water down from the [[Vallon de St. Imier]], are the main tributaries. The river [[Aar]]e was redirected into the lake in 1878, in order to prevent the flooding of the nearby area called &amp;quot;Seeland&amp;quot;, and drains the water out of the lake down to [[Büren, Solothurn|Büren]] through a simultaneously man-made channel. The level of all three lakes is being controlled by a dam built across the channel, in [[Port (Bern)|Port]].

The largest settlement along the shores of Lake Biel are the [[bilingual]] city of [[Biel/Bienne]] and its sister city [[Nidau]], both located on the northern end  The [[Sankt-Petersinsel]] (island) attracts tourists, mainly families. The island is located near [[Erlach, Switzerland|Erlach]]. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] once spent a few months on the island.

One of the main business in the area is the watch and affiliated microtechnic industries. World famous watch brands have their sites and headquarters in the area, including the [[Swatch Group]] and [[Rolex]] movements manufacture.

The lake&amp;apos;s surface is the [[List of cantons of Switzerland by elevation|lowest point]] of the canton of Neuchâtel.
