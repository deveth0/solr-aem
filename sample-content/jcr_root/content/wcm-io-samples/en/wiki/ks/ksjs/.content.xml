&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;KSJS&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (90.5&amp;amp;nbsp;MHz) is a [[college radio]] station that broadcasts 24 hours a day from the campus of [[San Jose State University]] in [[San Jose, California]], USA.  It went on the air on February 11, 1963, with only 85 watts of power. The studio is located in Hugh Gillis Hall, easily accessible to [[acronym:RTVF|RTVF]] majors. Originally, its transmitting antenna was installed atop the Walquist Library Building on campus, but broadcasting range was adversely affected due to the nearby Bank of America Building&amp;apos;s superior height. Today, however, its transmitter atop [[Coyote Peak]] broadcasts 1500 [[watt]]s, allowing the station to be heard by the entire [[Santa Clara Valley]] and much of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]].  Currently, the station features five musical formats: [[urban music|urban]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[subversive rock]], [[rock en EspaÃ±ol]], and [[jazz]].  It also has a variety of specialty broadcasting, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Radio Ethiopia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mecca One&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Celluloid Dreams&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Disco Funk Explosion]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The station is almost entirely student-run, and was one of the first radio stations in the nation to [[Streaming media|stream]] its programming over the [[Internet]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

KSJS carried regular news programs produced by San Jose State&amp;apos;s Radio-Television News Center, which had been started by Professor [[Gordon Greb]] in 1957.  The programs in the 1960s included a world and national news program, broadcast shortly after the daily sign-on, and &amp;quot;Spectrum,&amp;quot; a college news program with emphasis on San Jose State news.

From the 1970s through the early 1980s, KSJS was heavily-formatted, with students learning to &amp;quot;talk up&amp;quot; records, play [[public service announcement]]s at appropriate times and even &amp;quot;backtime&amp;quot; songs to a top-of-the-hour newscast from [[Mutual News]].  In recent years, the station has taken on more of a free-form approach.  KSJS has been named &amp;quot;Station of the Year&amp;quot; twice by the National Association of College Broadcasters. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Notable alumni include [[Kim Vestal]], a longtime San Jose radio star, currently on [[KRTY]]; [[Craig Bowers]], production director at [[KGO-AM]] in [[San Francisco]]; [[Steve Scott (announcer)|Steve Scott]], drivetime news anchor at [[WCBS-AM]] in [[New York City]]; [[Mark Nieto]] news and traffic anchor at [[KMVQ-FM]] in [[San Francisco]]; [[Lynn Gold]], weekend news anchor at [[KLIV]]; and [[Tony Kovaleski]], an investigative TV reporter at [[KMGH-TV]] in [[Denver]].
