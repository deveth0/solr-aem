&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;X10 Wireless Technology, Inc.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an American subsidiary of a [[Hong Kong]]-[[Bermuda]] company best known for [[marketing]] wireless [[camcorder|video camera]]s using controversial [[pop-up ad|pop-under advertisements]]. It was founded in 1999 in [[Kent, Washington]].


== History ==

X10 sprang from a small engineering company in Scotland called [[Pico Electronics, Ltd.]] in 1974.  Pico now fits under the umbrella of X10 Ltd.  X10 was a founding member of the [[Home Automation and Networking Association]].

In the latter 1970s, X-10 products were introduced in the US through hobbyist catalogue sales. [[Radio Shack Corporation|Radio Shack]] broadened the market to the American public in 1978. Soon after, [[Sears|Sears, Roebuck]] and other companies joined the market with X-10 and other branded products.

In 1989, X10 introduced a self-installed wireless security system, the [[SS5400]].

In 1995, X10 set up [[ORCA Monitoring Services]] in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] to handle the monitoring of their security systems.

X10&amp;apos;s website went live on the web at x10.com on 26 December 1996, becoming one of the first aggressive internet marketers.  In 2001, X10 was receiving more hits than Amazon and eBay, due to its use of pop-under advertising.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=88041&amp;amp;page=1#.UJFh4sXA8lo&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Under the [[One-For-All]] brand, X10 started manufacturing universal remotes for [[Universal Electronics, Inc.]] (UEI) in 1998.  The operation grew so large that soon X10 was manufacturing 1 million remotes per month.  X10 now makes remotes for many original equipment manufacturers, including [[Philips]], and is recognised for its [[infrared]] (IR) code library. This makes X10 one of the largest manufacturers of universal remotes in the world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
