&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kværner&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Norway]]-based [[engineering]] and [[construction]] services company that existed between 1853 and 2005. In 2004, it was amalgamated to the newly formed subsidiary of [[Aker ASA]] - [[Aker Kværner]], which was later renamed to [[Aker Solutions]] on 3 April 2008.

Kværner re-emerged on 6 May 2011, when the EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) part of [[Aker Solutions]] took the Kværner name. The new Kværner company was listed on [[Oslo Stock Exchange]] on July 8, 2011.

==History==
Kværner was founded in [[Oslo]] in 1853 and listed on the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]] in 1967. By the 1990s, Kværner assembled a collection of engineering and industrial businesses, including [[shipbuilding]], construction of offshore [[oil platform|oil and gas platforms]], production of [[Wood pulp|pulp]] and [[paper]] manufacturing equipment and operation of [[Shipping|shipping fleet]].

Director-general of Kværner after the stock exchange listing were [[Kjell B. Langballe]] (1960–1976), [[Carl Røtjer]] (1976–1986) and [[Mikal H. Grønner]] (1986–1989). Chairmen were [[Frithjof A. Lind]] (–1982), [[Johan B. Holte]] (1982–1985), [[Emil Eriksrud]] (1985–1986), Carl Røtjer (1986–1989), and then [[Kaspar Kielland]].

[[Erik Tønseth]] became director-general of Kværner in 1989, and under his leadership the company underwent large-scale international expansion, acquiring the state-owned [[Govan Shipbuilders]] from [[British Shipbuilders]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Store norske leksikon]] Entry on &amp;quot;Kværner ASA&amp;quot; {{no icon}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 1992 Kværner acquired the [[Sweden|Swedish]] company [[Götaverken]]. In 1996, Kværner acquired the UK conglomerate [[Trafalgar House (company)|Trafalgar House]] and moved its international headquarters from Oslo to [[London]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/1996/02/28/traf.t.php Kvaerner Is Close to Bidding for Troubled Group: Lifeline for Trafalgar House?]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The company&amp;apos;s expansive acquisitions brought economic hardship to the company. [[Kjell Almskog]] became CEO in 1998, and implemented various plans to streamline the company. This included the sale of the [[Cunard Line]] (a division of Trafalgar House) to [[Carnival Corporation]], the sale of [[Kvaerner Govan]] to [[BAE Systems]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.chriscunard.com/archives5.htm Cunard Archives, Trafalgar House Expansion and Decline]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and the sale of [[Chemrec]] to [[Deutsche Babcock|Babcock Borsig]]. The economic slowdown in 2001 and a series of management missteps brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy. In August 2000, Kværner sold its Construction Division to the Swedish company [[Skanska]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/4463572/Skanska-buys-Kvaerner-arm-for-180m.html Skanska buys Kvaerner arm for £180m] The Telegraph, 30 August 2000&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In November 2001, Kværner was forced to merge with its rival [[Aker ASA]], a Norwegian oil services group controlled by [[Kjell Inge Røkke]]. Røkke scuppered the solution preferred by Kværner&amp;apos;s management, a rescue by Russia&amp;apos;s oil giant [[Yukos]]. Kværner&amp;apos;s international headquarters returned to Oslo and Kværner was restructured to become a holding company, with operating activities concentrated in [[Aker Kværner]] and [[Aker Yards]]. As of 2005 Kværner ASA was merged with Aker Martitime Finance AS, a wholly owned company of Aker ASA and the Kværner corporation ceased to exist.
