&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zur&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; occurs five times in the [[King James Bible]] as the name of various people and a state.

The first mention is in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 25:15. This is the [[pericope]] where [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 25:1 tells us that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:

* And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was [[Cozbi]], the daughter of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zur&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.

The second mention is Numbers 31:8-9. Here, the nation of Israel is warring against the Midianites, and a body-count is given:

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, [[Evi (Bible)|Evi]], and [[List of minor Biblical figures#Rekem|Rekem]], and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zur&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and [[Hur (Bible)|Hur]], and [[Reba (Midian)|Reba]], five kings of [[Midian]]: [[Balaam]] also the son of [[Beor (Bible)|Beor]] they slew with the sword.
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

The third mention is a recapitulation of the second, at the pericope of Joshua&amp;apos;s death-scene, [[Joshua]] 13:21:

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of [[Sihon]] king of the Amorites, which reigned in [[Heshbon]], whom Moses smote with the princes of [[Midian]], [[List of minor Biblical figures#Evi|Evi]], and [[List of minor Biblical figures#Rekem|Rekem]], and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zur&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; , and [[Hur (Bible)|Hur]], and [[List of minor Biblical figures#Reba|Reba]], which were dukes of [[Sihon]], dwelling in the country.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

The fourth mention is in the begats at [[Books of Chronicles|First Chronicles]] 8:30:

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;And his firstborn son Abdon, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zur&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and Kish, and Baal, and Nadab&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

The fifth mention is about the servers at the temple, [[Books of Chronicles|First Chronicles]] 9:35-36:

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;And in [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeon]] dwelt the father of Gibeon, [[Jehiel]], whose wife&amp;apos;s name was [[Maachah]]:
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;And his firstborn son [[Abdon]]{{dn|date=March 2012}}, then &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zur&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and [[Kish (Bible)|Kish]], and Baal, and Ner, and [[Nadab (son of Aaron)|Nadab]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
