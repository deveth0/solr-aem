&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zurab Avalishvili&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ka|ზურაბ ავალიშვილი}}) (1876 – May 21, 1944) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] historian, jurist and diplomat in the service of the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] (1918–1921). He was also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zurab Davidovich Avalov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in a [[Russian language|Russian]] manner.

Born in [[Tbilisi]], Georgia (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]), into the family of Prince David [[Avalishvili]], he graduated from [[St. Petersburg University]] in 1900 and took post-graduate courses at the Department of Law, [[University of Paris]] from 1900 to 1903. He became a [[Docent]] at the St. Petersburg University in 1904 and a [[Professor]] of [[Public law|Public Law]] at the [[Saint Petersburg Polytechnical University|St. Petersburg Polytechnical Institute]] in 1907. He was an official adviser to the Russian Ministry of Trade and Commerce for many years.

After the [[February Revolution]] in Russia, Avalishvili was named a [[Governing Senate|Senator]] by the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] in May 1917. When Georgia declared independence on May 26, 1918, Avalishvili entered Georgian diplomatic service and was appointed a Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. He rendered important services to his homeland as a member of her delegation to the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].

The [[Red Army invasion of Georgia]] forced him into exile in March 1921. He lived thereafter in [[Germany]] where he worked as a Professor at the [[University of Munich]]. He was one of the founding members of the Georgian Association in Germany and worked for the editorial boars of historical journals &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Georgica&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[London]]) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Byzantion&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Brussels]]). He died in 1944, in Germany, and was reburied to [[Didube Pantheon]], Tbilisi, in 1994.

Avalishvili’s main works focuses on the history of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the [[Caucasus]], Georgian literature (e.g., the critical studies of [[Shota Rustaveli]]), international law and Georgia’s foreign relations. His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Independence of Georgia in International Politics, 1918-1921&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a detailed and well-documented first-hand account of Georgia’s relations with its neighbors, the nation’s struggle for recognition and its international ramifications in the period of 1918 to 1921. Much of the works is in diary form, the author being judiciously critical of ineptitude of the Caucasian governments.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Smele, Jonathan D.
