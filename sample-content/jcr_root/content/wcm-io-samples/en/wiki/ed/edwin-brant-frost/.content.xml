&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Edwin Brant Frost II&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (July 16, 1866 &amp;amp;ndash; May 14, 1935) was an American [[astronomer]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Brattleboro]], [[Vermont]].  His father, Carlton Pennington Frost,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;struve&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; was dean of [[Dartmouth Medical School]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url = http://dms.dartmouth.edu/about/history/history.shtml | title = Two Hundred Years of Medicine at Dartmouth | first = Barbara | last = Blough | coauthors = Dana Cook Grossman | publisher = Dartmouth Medical School | accessdate = 2008-06-25 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Frost graduated from [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] in 1886.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;struve&amp;quot;&amp;gt;  {{Cite document | first = Otto | last = Struve  | author-link = Otto Struve | title = Biographical Memoir of Edwin Brant Frost|date=1937| publisher = [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]| url =http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/efrost.pdf | postscript = &amp;lt;!--None--&amp;gt; }}
&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He continued his education as a post-graduate student in chemistry and in 1887 became an instructor in physics while only 21 years old.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;struve&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; In 1890 Frost went abroad to Europe and ended up researching [[stellar spectroscopy]] under [[Hermann Carl Vogel|Hermann Vogel]] in [[Astrophysical Institute Potsdam|Potsdam]].  He returned to [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] in 1892 as an assistant professor of astronomy.

He was fond of the outdoors and enjoyed [[golf]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], and [[ice skating]].  He also enjoyed [[music]] and [[literature]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;fox&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  In 1896 he married Mary E. Hazard.  They had three children, Katharine, Frederick, and Benjamin.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;struve&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Frost joined the staff of [[Yerkes Observatory]] in 1898 and became its director in 1905 when [[George Ellery Hale|George Hale]] resigned. Frost kept the position until his retirement in 1932.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;struve&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  He was the editor of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Astrophysical Journal]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from 1902 to 1932, known for his careful attention to details.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;fox&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  In 1915 he lost the use of his right eye and in 1921, his left.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;struve&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  Despite his blindness he continued working for eleven more years until his retirement in 1932.

He died in 1935 in [[Chicago]] from [[peritonitis]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Edwin B.

==Legacy==
Frost&amp;apos;s research focused on the determination of [[radial velocity]] using stellar spectroscopy and [[spectroscopic binaries]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;fox&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite document | first = Philip | last = Fox  | author-link = Philip Fox (astronomer) | title = Edwin Brant Frost, 1866-1935|date=January 1936| publisher = [[The Astrophysical Journal]]| bibcode = 1936ApJ....83....1F | postscript = &amp;lt;!--None--&amp;gt;}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  In 1902, he discovered the strange behavior of [[Beta Cephei]], which later became the prototype for [[Beta Cephei variable]] stars.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;struve&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

He played a significant role in bringing [[Otto Struve]] to the [[United States]], when the latter was living as an impoverished refugee in [[Turkey]] after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]]. He later supported the appointment of Struve as his successor as director of Yerkes Observatory.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

[[Asteroid]] [[854 Frostia]] is named in his honor.
