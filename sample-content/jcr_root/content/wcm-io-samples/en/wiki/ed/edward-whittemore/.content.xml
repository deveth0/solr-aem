        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Edward Whittemore&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (May 26, 1933 &amp;amp;ndash; August 3, 1995) was an American [[novel]]ist, the author of five novels written between 1974 and 1987 and a case officer in the [[Central Intelligence Agency#Developing_world|Central Intelligence Agency&amp;apos;s Directorate of Operations]] (Asia, Middle East and Europe) between 1958 and 1967.

==Biography and writing career==
The youngest of five children, Whittemore was born on May 26, 1933 in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], USA, but little else is known about his early life.  He graduated from [[Deering High School]], [[Portland, Maine]], in 1951, and went to [[Yale University|Yale]] shortly after, where he obtained a degree in history.  He then joined the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and served as an officer on a tour of duty in [[Japan]], where he was approached by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and recruited into the service.  Working undercover as a [[reporter]] for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Japan Times]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from 1958 until 1967, Whittemore visited the [[Far East]], [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]].

It was during this time that Whittemore began working on the novels for which he is probably best known.  These constitute the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jerusalem Quartet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, while another, earlier book titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quin&amp;apos;s Shanghai Circus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1974) contains the seeds of what was to come in the sequence.  Out of print for many years, all five books were reissued by [[Old Earth Books]] in 2003.

Many writers and critics have lauded the novels&amp;apos; breadth and imaginative intensity in publications such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The New York Times Book Review]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Harper&amp;apos;s Magazine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Village Voice]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Locus (magazine)|Locus Magazine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp;amp; Science Fiction]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  On the other hand, [[science fiction]] author and critic [[Thomas M. Disch]] gave &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jerusalem Poker&amp;apos;&amp;apos; a very negative review in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Times Literary Supplement]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, bemoaning more enthusiastic appreciations as a &amp;quot;litany of [[avant-garde]] hype&amp;quot; while labelling Whittemore an &amp;quot;anti-writer&amp;quot; with a &amp;quot;genteel poverty of imagination.&amp;quot;

In spite of all the enthusiastic reviews, the original editions failed to achieve the same degree of commercial success, and only about 3,000 [[hardcover]] and 10,000 [[paperback]] copies of each novel ever found a buyer.  Whittemore was remarkably jealous about his privacy and refused to give interviews to &amp;quot;unknown correspondents,&amp;quot; an attitude that somewhat hampered the promotion effort.  His favorite word, &amp;quot;inscrutable,&amp;quot; could also very appropriately be applied to him.

In 1982, Whittemore met American artist [[Helen Bar-Lev]], and they lived together in [[Jerusalem]] for five years until he abruptly left her.  During this time, Bar-Lev drew several sketches of Edward Whittemore and wrote a number of poems about him. [http://www.jerusalemdreaming.info/miscellaneous/helen_barlev.htm]

Edward Whittemore spent the final years of his life in poverty.  He died on August 3, 1995 in [[New York City]], shortly after being diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]].
