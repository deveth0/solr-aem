&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Edwin Thanhouser&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (November 11, 1865 &amp;amp;ndash; March 21, 1956) was an actor, businessman, and film producer, most notable as a founder of the [[Thanhouser Company]], along with his wife [[Gertrude Thanhouser]] and brother-in-law [[Lloyd Lonergan]].

==Biography==
Thanhouser was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. In 1893, he joined the traveling company of [[Alessandro Salvini]]. After Salvini&amp;apos;s unexpected death in 1896, Thanhouser managed the Academy Theater in [[Milwaukee, Wisconson]] for the [[Shubert family]] and then the Bush Temple Theater in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. He formed a stock company that put on hundreds of theatrical productions.

On February 8, 1900, Thanhouser married actress Gertrude Homan.

In 1909, Thanhouser and his family moved to [[New Rochelle, New York]], where he leased space in an old wooden [[ice rink|skating rink]] to start the Thanhouser Company. This pioneering movie studio released its first commercial film on March 15, 1910.

Thanhouser brought actress [[Florence La Badie]] to the company in 1911. From 1911 to 1917, she was the company&amp;apos;s most prominent star. In 1912, he sold the film company to group headed by [[Charles J. Hite]]. Early in 1915, after Hite&amp;apos;s death in an accident, Thanhouser took charge of the company again, but was not as successful as he had been before. The [[Thanhouser Company|Thanhouser Film Corporation]] was liquidated in 1918.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Thanhouser Films: An Encyclopedia and History, Q.

Edwin Thanhouser engaged in securities investments and collected art in his later years. He died March 21, 1956.
