&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Edward Riley Stettinius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 15, 1865 - September 3, 1925) was a United States executive.  He was president of [[Diamond Match Company]] for a time. After the start of [[World War I]], he worked at [[J. P. Morgan and Company]] coordinating the purchase of war supplies for [[Triple Entente|the Allies]].  When the [[United States]] entered the war, he went to work in its [[United States Department of Defense|War Department]].

==Biography==
Stettinius was born in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].  His father was a wholesale grocer.  He was educated at [[St. Louis University]].  The needs of his family obligated him to drop out at 16,&amp;lt;ref name=anb&amp;gt;{{Cite ANB|title=Stettinius, Edward Reilly|author=Robert James Maddox}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  and he went to work for a grocery firm and then a hat and cap firm.  He then tried several lines of business on his own account, but was not very successful, and went to work in a banking firm.

By 1891, both his mother and father had died,&amp;lt;ref name=anb/&amp;gt; and he went to [[Chicago]] to try his luck in the grain pit there, but did not find that he could satisfactorily predict the price of wheat and left the grain pit to become treasurer in the Stirling Boiler Company.  The business [[panic of 1893]] obligated him to add several other tasks to the one of treasurer.  As conditions improved, he began to work in sales, doing well enough that he became general manager of the company.  His participation in the merger of that company and several others in the same line to form [[Babcock &amp;amp; Wilcox]] helped his reputation, and he was recruited to work at [[Diamond Match Company]], where he became president in 1909. His employer at Stirling was [[O. C. Barber]], who also used his influence to make him president at Diamond Match, where Stettinius succeeded him.

At the beginning of [[World War I]], Stettinius went to work for [[J. P. Morgan and Company]], where he worked as chief buyer of war supplies for the Allies, overseeing a work force of around 150 people.  When the United States entered the war, he went to work for the War Department, in charge of procurement and production of supplies for the [[United States Army|Army]].  On April 6, 1918, he became Assistant Secretary of War.

After the war, he went back to work for Morgan and Company, devoting his attention to restructuring large companies.&amp;lt;ref name=anb/&amp;gt;  He died at [[Locust Valley, New York|Locust Valley]], [[Long Island]].&amp;lt;ref name=dab&amp;gt;{{Cite DAB|title=Stettinius, Edward Riley |year=1935 |first=William Bristol |last=Shaw}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Family==
He married Judith Carrington of [[Richmond, Virginia]]. They had four children, among them Stettinius&amp;apos;s namesake, [[Edward Stettinius, Jr.]], who also worked as a business executive, and was [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] for a time.
