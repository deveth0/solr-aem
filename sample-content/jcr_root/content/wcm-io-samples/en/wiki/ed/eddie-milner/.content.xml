&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Edward James Milner&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born May 21, 1955) is an American former [[professional baseball]] player.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Eddie Milner statistics&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/milneed01.shtml |title=Eddie Milner statistics |publisher=baseball-reference.com |accessdate=5 July 2012 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He played all or part of nine seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] for the [[Cincinnati Reds]] (1980–86, 1988) and [[San Francisco Giants]] (1987), primarily as a [[center fielder]]. Milner batted and threw left-handed.

==Baseball career==
Eddie Milner was drafted out of [[Central State University]] in [[Wilberforce, Ohio]] by the Reds in 1976. Milner was part of the disappointing transition of the championship Cincinnati Reds teams of the 1970&amp;apos;s. The Reds transitioned from players including Ken Griffey Sr., George Foster, and Ray Knight, taking their chances with players including Milner, Gary Redus, and Clint Hurdle.  The team spiraled from competitive to years of 100 losses.  Milner,  fast runner and with limited offense skills ended his career with the Giants.  A highlight of his career, in 1986 he had a 20-game hitting streak and belted 15 [[home run]]s.

Milner suffered from cocaine addiction during his baseball career. Commissioner Peter Ueberroth suspended him for the entire 1988 season after he relapsed, but he was reinstated before the All-Star break after completing a drug rehabilitation program. The Reds released him on July 31, ending his major league career.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Eddie Milner statistics&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Career statistics==
In a nine-year major league career, Milner played in 804 [[Games played|games]], accumulating 607 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] in 2,395 [[at bats]] for a .253 career [[batting average]] along with 42 [[home run]]s, 195 [[runs batted in]] and an [[on base percentage]] of .333. Along with [[César Tovar]], Milner is regarded as the all-time major league leader in breaking up [[No-hitter|no-hit]] attempts with five.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tC0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA6&amp;amp;lpg=PA6&amp;amp;dq=dick+bosman+one+hitter&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=_R-8m2ElVr&amp;amp;sig=9pEvXpE-copW6MtPyps9yhhxpVQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=nSTLSqGoN4GxtgejnejpAQ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=dick%20bosman%20one%20hitter&amp;amp;f=false |title=The Fans Speak Out |author= |publisher=|date=August 2007 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=5 July 2012 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; On August 2, 1986, Milner collected his team&amp;apos;s only hit in a game for fifth time, tying Tovar&amp;apos;s major league record (1975).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/10-things-i-didnt-know-about-one-hitters/ |title=10 Things I Didn&amp;apos;t Know about One Hitters |publisher=hardballtimes.com |accessdate=5 July 2012 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
