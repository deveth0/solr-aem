        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Edmund&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Etmond mac Maíl Coluim&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (after 1070 &amp;amp;ndash; after 1097) was a son of [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Máel Coluim mac Donnchada]] and his second wife [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]]. He may be found on some lists of Scottish kings, but there is no evidence that he was king.

On the death of Edmund&amp;apos;s father and his heir-designate, Edward, his eldest son by Margaret, in November 1093, Máel Coluim&amp;apos;s brother [[Donald III of Scotland|Domnall Bán]] took the throne. Edmund and his younger brothers [[Edgar of Scotland|Edgar]], [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander]] and [[David I of Scotland|David]] fled abroad, to [[England]], to join their half-brother [[Duncan II of Scotland|Donnchad]] at the court of [[William Rufus]].

In 1094 Donnchad, with Rufus&amp;apos;s blessing and the support of landless nobles from the English court and landowners in Lothian, drove Domnall Bán from the throne. It is supposed that Edmund, as the next in age, was Donnchad&amp;apos;s heir-designate. Donnchad was forced by a rebellion to send his English allies home, and was shortly afterwards killed. The killer was [[Máel Petair of Mearns|Máel Petair]], [[Mormaer of Mearns]], but the [[Annals of Ulster]] and [[William of Malmesbury]] agree that the killing was done on the orders of Domnall Bán and Edmund.

What caused Edmund to join with his uncle is unknown. It is assumed that Domnall appointed him his heir as Domnall had no sons of his own, and it is thought that Edmund was granted an [[appanage]] to rule.

Edmund&amp;apos;s maternal uncle [[Edgar Ætheling]] came north in 1097, driving Domnall from the throne and installing Edgar as King, with Alexander as his heir-designate. While Domnall was mutilated and imprisoned, dying in 1099, Edmund was more fortunate. He was tonsured and sent to the [[Cluniac]] monastery at [[Montacute]] in [[Somerset]]. The exact date of his death is unknown.
