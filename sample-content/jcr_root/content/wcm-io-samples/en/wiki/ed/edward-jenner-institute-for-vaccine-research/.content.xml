        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an independent research institute named after [[Edward Jenner]], the inventor of [[vaccination]]. It was co-located with the Compton Laboratory of the [[Institute for Animal Health]] on a campus in the [[England|English]] village of [[Compton, Berkshire|Compton]]. After occupying temporary laboratory space at the Institute for Animal Health from 1996, the Institute moved to a newly completed laboratory building in 1998. Funding of the Institute continued until October 2005 when it was closed.

A successor institute, formed by a partnership between the University of Oxford and the UK Institute for Animal Health, was established in November 2005. This Jenner Institute is headquartered in Oxford and supported by a specific charity, the Jenner Vaccine Foundation.
