        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Edmond Gore Alexander Holmes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1850&amp;amp;ndash;1936) was an educationalist, writer and [[poet]] who was born at Moycashel, co. Westmeath, Ireland. His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Creed of the Buddha&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1908) is well known; he also wrote a [[pantheist]] text &amp;apos;&amp;apos;All is One: A Plea for a Higher Pantheism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Words from his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Triumph of Love&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were set to music by the composer [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], a friend.

He was also a schools inspector, rising to become chief inspector for elementary schools in 1905. He resigned in 1911, over a confidential memorandum criticising school inspectors who had formerly been elementary school teachers. This angered the teachers&amp;apos; union and it led to the downfall of [[Robert Morant]]  the permanent secretary to the Board of Education when it became public. Holmes subsequent writings on education are taken as an early statement of &amp;quot;progressive&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;child-centred&amp;quot; positions, and are still cited.  Later works come close to [[theosophy]].  For example, even a 1914 book review of his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;In Defence of What Might Be&amp;apos;&amp;apos; describes it as &amp;quot;pregnant with possibilities for the untrammeled soul of the growing child. A draft of fresh air into static pedagogy.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |title=Books of the week |url=http://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/338/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=Nov 30, 1914 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
