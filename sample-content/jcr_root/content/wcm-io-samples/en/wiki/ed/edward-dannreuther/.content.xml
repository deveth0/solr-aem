&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Edward Dannreuther&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (4 November 1844, [[Strasbourg]] &amp;amp;ndash; 12 February 1905, [[Hastings]]) was a German pianist and writer on music, resident from 1863 in England. In Dannreuther&amp;apos;s youth his father had emigrated to [[Cincinnati]] in the US, and established a piano manufacturing business. Under pressure from his father to enter banking as a career, a prospect he found uncongenial, he escaped to [[Leipzig]] in 1859.

He trained as a musician at the [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Leipzig Conservatory]], where he was a pupil of [[Ignaz Moscheles]]. He became a champion of Wagner, and founded the London [[International Association of Wagner Societies|Wagner Society]] in 1872. In 1863 he had been recruited by [[Henry Chorley]] to perform in London at [[the Crystal Palace]] concerts. His performances of [[Chopin]] and [[Beethoven]] were well received; after his marriage in 1871 he decided to settle permanently in England.

Dannreuther became a professor of piano at the [[Royal College of Music]] in 1895, a position he held until his death.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|title=Dannreuther, Professor Edward|journal=Who&amp;apos;s Who,|year=1905|volume=vol. 57|pages=p. 399|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vDsJAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA399}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; An enthusiast for new music, he was an important influence on the composer [[Hubert Parry]], who was his pupil.&amp;lt;ref name=dnb&amp;gt;Dibble, Jeremy, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35393 &amp;quot;Parry, Sir (Charles) Hubert Hastings, baronet (1848–1918)&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 18 April 2013 {{ODNBsub}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; A memorial plaque on his former home at 12 Orme Square, [[Westminster]], London was unveiled on 26 July 2005. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ &amp;quot;Edward Danreuther&amp;quot;], City of Westminster green plaques&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

His son [[Hubert Edward Dannreuther]] was a British admiral and one of six survivors of the sinking of [[HMS Invincible (1907)|HMS Invincible]].
