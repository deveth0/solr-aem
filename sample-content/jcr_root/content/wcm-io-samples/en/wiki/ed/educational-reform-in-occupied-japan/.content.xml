        text="&lt;p&gt;During [[World War II]], many [[Japan]]ese students were enlisted to actively help in the [[war effort]], effectively turning schools into factories. Bombings destroyed many schools. After the war, this left a lot for the [[occupied Japan|occupation]] forces to help rebuild.

The occupation team addressed the [[Education|educational system]]. The Japanese methods were nearly opposite to that of the [[United States]]: control of schools was highly centralized, rote [[memorization]] of verbatim book knowledge without much interaction described the standard student-teacher relationship and the study texts were described as boring. The ratio of school years was made to resemble that of the United States&amp;apos; which was 6 years [[Elementary education]] : 3 years Lower Secondary education : 3 years Upper Secondary education : 4 years [[Higher Education]].  Over the period of occupation, these and many other trends were changed. A less centralized hierarchy of school administrators was introduced; totally unprecedented, parents were allowed to vote for school boards. A new [[textbook]] industry was created.

However, after the end of occupation, much of Japan&amp;apos;s educational system reverted to the older system.
