&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;EDGAR&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Electronic Data-Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; system, performs automated collection, validation, indexing, acceptance, and forwarding of submissions by companies and others who are required by law to file forms with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (the &amp;quot;SEC&amp;quot;). The database is freely available to the public via the Internet (Web or FTP).

== Filings ==
Not all [[SEC filing]]s by [[public companies]] are available on EDGAR. Companies were phased in to EDGAR filing over a three-year period, ending 6 May 1996. As of that date, all public domestic companies were required to submit their filings via EDGAR, except for hardcopy paper filings, which were allowed under a [[hardship exemption]]. Third-party filings with respect to these companies, such as [[tender offer]]s and [[Schedule 13D]] filings, are also filed via EDGAR.

The vast majority of documents are now filed electronically, with in excess of 3,000 filings per day.

As of 4 November 2002, the SEC required all foreign companies and foreign governments to file their documents via EDGAR. Prior to that time, electronic filing by foreign companies also was voluntary.

Actual [[annual report]]s to shareholders (except in the case of [[mutual fund]] companies) need not be submitted on EDGAR, although some companies do so voluntarily. However, the annual report on [[Form 10-K]] or Form 10-KSB, which contains much of the same information, is required to be filed on EDGAR.
