        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Edward Fairfax&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1580? &amp;amp;ndash; 27 January 1635) was a translator, the [[Illegitimacy|natural]] son of Sir Thomas Fairfax the elder, of Denton in Yorkshire, and thus a half-brother of [[Thomas Fairfax, 1st Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Sir Thomas Fairfax]].

Fairfax lived at New Hall, [[Fewston]]&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;wg&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The History and Topology of Harragate and Knaresbourough Forest by [[William Grainge]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
, near [[Harrogate]], [[Yorkshire]], [[England]] in peace and prosperity. His translation of [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Jerusalem Delivered]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, for which he is best known, is considered a masterpiece, one of the comparatively few translations which in themselves are literature. It was highly praised by [[John Dryden|Dryden]] and Waller. The first edition appeared in 1600, and was dedicated to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]]. Fairfax also wrote a treatise on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[demonology]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in which he was a devout believer.

Edward&amp;apos;s daughters Elizabeth and Anne were baptised in [[Fewston]] village church in 1606 and 1621 respectively.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;wg&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
