==Life and career==

Eddie Edwards was born in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], started playing [[violin]] at age 10, and took up [[trombone]] in addition at 15.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;am&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  He played both instruments professionally, including with the bands of [[Papa Jack Laine]] and Ernest Giardina. In addition to music Edwards played minor-league [[baseball]] and worked as an electrician.

In 1916 he was picked by [[Alcide Nunez]] to go to [[Chicago, Illinois]] to play trombone with [[Johnny Stein]]&amp;apos;s Jazz Band.  With a few changes of personnel this band became the famous Original Dixieland Jazz Band which made the first [[gramophone record|records]] of jazz music in 1917.

He left the band after being drafted into the [[United States Army]]. The O.D.J.B. replaced him with [[Emile Christian]]. Edwards served in the Army from July 1918 to March 1919. After discharge he led a band of his own and worked in the band of [[Jimmie Durante]] before returning to the O.D.J.B.

After the breakup the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, Edwards again led his own band in [[New York City]] for most of the 1920s. In the early 1930s he retired from music and ran a [[newspaper]] stand and worked as a [[sport]]s coach.

He returned to music when [[Nick LaRocca]] reformed the O.D.J.B. in 1936, playing with them until 1938. He played with other bands including O.D.J.B. alumni [[Larry Shields]], [[Tony Sbarbaro]], and [[J. Russell Robinson]] in New York into the 1940s. He continued playing professionally irregularly until shortly before his death in New York City in 1963.

Jazz musician [[Johnny Wiggs]] said that while he&amp;apos;d heard more sophisticated trombone players, he&amp;apos;d &amp;quot;never heard another trombonist who could give a band the rhythmic punch that Edwards could.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:nmDtMvnPMeEJ:jazzagemusic.blogspot.com/2011_05_22_archive.html+eddie+edwards+odjb+johnny+wiggs&amp;amp;cd=15&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;source=www.google.com Jazz Age Music.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

His composition &amp;quot;Sensation Rag&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Sensation&amp;quot; was performed at the 1938 landmark [[Benny Goodman]] jazz concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] released on the album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Honors==

The ODJB 1917 recording of &amp;quot;[[Darktown Strutter&amp;apos;s Ball]]&amp;quot; on Columbia was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2006.
