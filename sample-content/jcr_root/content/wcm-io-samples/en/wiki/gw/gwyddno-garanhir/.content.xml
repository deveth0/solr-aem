        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gwyddno Garanhir&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the supposed ruler of a sunken land off the coast of [[Wales]], known as [[Cantre&amp;apos;r Gwaelod]]. He was the father of [[Elffin ap Gwyddno]], the foster-father of the famous [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[poet]], [[Taliesin]], in the legendary account given in the late medieval &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chwedl Taliesin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ystoria Taliesin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;/&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hanes Taliesin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; &amp;quot;The Tale of Taliesin&amp;quot;).

==Legend==
The basket of Gwyddno Garanhir is one of the [[Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain]]. According to tradition, Gwyddno was the lord of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Cantre&amp;apos;r Gwaelod]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-en|The Lowland [[Cantref|Hundred]]}}) in what is now [[Cardigan Bay]]. His chief [[fortress]] was said to have been &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Caer Wyddno&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-en|the Fort of Gwyddno}}), located somewhere to the north-west of modern-day [[Aberystwyth]]. The whole kingdom was protected from the sea by floodgates, which had to be shut before high tide. One day the keeper of the floodgates, [[Seithenyn]], was drunk and failed to close them, with the result that the sea rushed in and covered the land.

==Kingdom==
Stories of the drowned lands of Gwyddno appear to have arisen from the identification of natural submarinal ridges as the remains of sea walls. However, tradition also assigns Gwyddno a landlocked portion of his kingdom to which he was able to flee. He was called &amp;apos;King of [[Ceredigion]]&amp;apos; by the 18th century [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[antiquarian]], [[Iolo Morganwg]], well known for his literary forgeries, but he does not appear in the [[Old Welsh language|Old Welsh]] pedigrees for that kingdom. He is identified with a number of different historical Gwyddnos in various sources. 16th century writers favoured Gwyddno ap Clydno, the late 6th century King of [[Meirionydd]], who is perhaps the most likely candidate.

In [[Susan Cooper]]&amp;apos;s [[The Dark is Rising]] series, Gwyddno is the king of the Lost Lands in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Silver on the Tree&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Epithet==
His name is [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and means &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gwyddno Long-Shanks&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Crane-Legs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
