An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;acetal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[functional group]] with the following connectivity RC(H)(OR&amp;apos;)2, where R, R&amp;apos; are organic fragments.  They are saturated and tetrahedral.  The two R&amp;apos;O groups can be equivalent or not.  Acetals are formed from and convertible to aldehydes.  The related functional group, ketals, are correspondingly obtained from and convertible to ketones.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=ketals|file=K03376}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Cellulose]] is a ubiquitous example of an acetal.

Formation of an acetal occurs when the [[hydroxyl]] group of a [[hemiacetal]] becomes [[protonated]] and is lost as water. The [[carbocation]] ion that is produced is then rapidly attacked by a molecule of [[alcohol]]. Loss of the proton from the attached alcohol gives the acetal.

Acetals are stable compared to hemiacetals but their formation is a reversible [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] as with [[esters]]. As a reaction to create an acetal proceeds, water must be removed from the reaction mixture, for example, with a [[Dean-Stark apparatus]], lest it will [[hydrolyse]] the product back to the hemiacetal. The formation of acetals reduces the total number of molecules present and therefore is not favourable with regards to [[entropy]]. A way to improve this is to use an [[orthoester]] as a source of alcohol. Aldehydes and ketones undergo a process called acetal exchange with orthoesters to give acetals. Water produced along with the acetal product is used up in hydrolysing the [[orthoester]] and producing more alcohol to be used in the reaction.

Most [[glycosidic bond]]s in [[carbohydrate]]s and other [[polysaccharide]]s are acetal linkages.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=glycosides|file=G02661}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Acetaldehyde diethyl acetal is an important flavouring compound in [[distilled beverage]]s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Volatile Compounds in Foods and Beverages, ISBN 0-8247-8390-5, http://books.google.com/books?id=_OvXjhLUz-oC, p.554&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The plastic known as [[Polyoxymethylene plastic|acetal]] is a polyacetal of [[formaldehyde]].

Acetals are used as [[protecting group]]s for [[carbonyl]] groups in organic synthesis as they are stable with respect to hydrolysis by [[base (chemistry)|bases]] and with respect to many oxidizing and reducing agents.

==Acetalisation==
Acetalisation is the [[organic reaction]] that involves the formation of an acetal (or [[ketal]]s). One way of acetal formation is the [[nucleophilic addition]] of an [[alcohol]] to a [[ketone]] or an [[aldehyde]]. Acetalisation is often used in [[organic synthesis]] to create a [[protecting group]] because it is a reversible reaction.

Acetalisation is [[acid]] [[catalysis|catalysed]] with elimination of water; acetals do &amp;apos;&amp;apos;not&amp;apos;&amp;apos; form under [[base (chemistry)|basic]] conditions. The reaction can be driven to the acetal when water is removed from the reaction system either by [[azeotropic distillation]] or trapping water with [[molecular sieve]]s or [[aluminium oxide]].

The carbonyl group in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;1&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; takes a proton from [[hydrochloric acid]]. The protonated carbonyl group 2 is activated for [[nucleophilic addition]] of the alcohol. The structures &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;2a&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;2b&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are [[mesomer]]s. After [[deprotonation]] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;3&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by water the [[hemiacetal]] or [[hemiketal]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;4&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is formed. The hydroxyl group in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;4&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is protonated leading to the [[oxonium ion]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;6&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which accepts a second alcohol group to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;7&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; with a final deprotonation to the acetal &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;8&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The reverse reaction takes place by adding water in the same acidic medium. Acetals are stable towards [[base (chemistry)|basic]] media. In a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;transacetalisation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;crossacetalisation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; a diol reacts with an acetal or two different acetals react with each other. Again this is possible because all the reaction steps are equilibria.
