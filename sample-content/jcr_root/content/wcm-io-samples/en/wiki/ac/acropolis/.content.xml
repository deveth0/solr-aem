An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;acropolis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-el|Ακρόπολις}}; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;akros, akron,&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;acro- (n.d.) The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved September 29, 2008, [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/acro- from Dictionary.com website:] Quote: &amp;quot;[From Greek akros, extreme; see ak- in Indo-European roots.] &amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; edge, extremity + &amp;apos;&amp;apos;polis,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; city; plural: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;acropoleis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;acropolises&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[Human settlement|settlement]], especially a [[citadel]], built upon an area of elevated ground&amp;amp;mdash;frequently a hill with [[precipice|precipitous]] sides, chosen for purposes of defense. In many parts of the world, acropoleis became the nuclei of large cities of [[classical antiquity]], such as [[ancient Rome]], which in more recent times grew up on the surrounding lower ground, such as modern [[Rome]].

[[File:AthensAcropolisDawnAdj06028.jpg|thumb|left|675px|The [[Acropolis of Athens]] as seen from [[Mount Lycabettus]] (northeast). The wooded [[Pnyx|Hill of the Nymphs]] is half-visible on its right, and Philopappos Hill on the left, immediately behind. [[Philopappos Monument]] stands where, in the distant background, the coast of [[Peloponnese]] meet the waters of the [[Saronic Gulf]].]]&amp;lt;!-- Please note, the Parthenon is not an acropolis, but rather sits upon one --&amp;gt;

The word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;acropolis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; literally in Greek means &amp;quot;city on the extremity&amp;quot; and though associated primarily with the [[Greece|Greek]] cities [[Athens]], [[Argos]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] (with its [[Acrocorinth]]), may be applied generically to all such citadels, including Rome, [[Jerusalem]], Celtic [[Bratislava]], many in [[Asia Minor]], or even [[Castle Rock, Edinburgh|Castle Rock]] in [[Edinburgh]]. An example in Ireland is the [[Rock of Cashel]]. Acropolis is also the term used by archaeologists and historians to the urban [[Castro culture]] settlements located in Northwestern Iberian hilltops.

The most famous example is the [[Acropolis of Athens]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/404 World Heritage: Acropolis, Athens ]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; which, by reason of its historical associations and the several famous buildings erected upon it (most notably the [[Parthenon]]), is known without qualification as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the Acropolis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  Although originating in the mainland of Greece, use of the acropolis model quickly spread to Greek colonies such as the [[Dorians|Dorian]] [[Lato]] on [[Crete]] during the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]].

Because of its classical [[Hellenistic]] style, the ruins of [[Mission San Juan Capistrano|Mission San Juan Capistrano&amp;apos;s]] Great Stone Church in [[California|California, United States]] has been called the &amp;quot;American Acropolis&amp;quot;.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Other parts of the world developed other names for the high citadel or [[alcázar]], which often reinforced a naturally strong site. In Central [[Italy]], many small rural [[comune|communes]] still cluster at the base of a fortified habitation known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;La Rocca&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the commune.

The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;acropolis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is also used to describe the central complex of overlapping structures, such as plazas and pyramids, in many [[Maya city|Maya cities]], including [[Tikal]] and [[Copán]].
