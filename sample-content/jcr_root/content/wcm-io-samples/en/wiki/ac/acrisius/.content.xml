        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Acrisius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-grc|Ἀκρίσιος}}) was a [[Greek mythology|mythical]] king of [[Argos]], and a son of [[Abas, son of Lynceus|Abas]] and [[Aglaea]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus2.html Book 2].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; (or [[Ocalea (mythology)|Ocalea]], depending on the author), grandson of [[Lynceus]], great-grandson of [[Danaus]].  His twin brother was [[Proetus]], with whom he is said to have quarreled even in the womb of his mother. When Abas died and Acrisius had grown up, he expelled Proetus from his inheritance; but, supported by his father-in-law [[Iobates]], the [[Lycia]]n, Proetus returned, and Acrisius was compelled to share his kingdom with his brother by giving [[Tiryns]] to him, while he retained Argos for himself.

==Acrisius and Perseus==
Disappointed by his lack of luck in having a son, Acrisius consults the Oracle at Delphi, who warns him that he will one day be killed by his daughter [[Danaë]]&amp;apos;s son. Danaë is childless and to keep her so, he imprisons her in a bronze chamber open to the sky in the courtyard of his palace. [[Zeus]] impregnates her in the form of a golden shower (some accounts say it is her uncle, Proetus, who impregnates her).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;DGRBM&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Citation

Acrisius puts the child and Danaë in a chest and throws it into the sea. Zeus asks [[Poseidon]] to calm the water; he does and Danaë and Perseus survive, washing up on the island of [[Seriphos]].  A fisherman named [[Dictys]], brother of King [[Polydectes]], finds the pair and takes care of them.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ii. 2. § 1, 4. § 1.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ii. 16. § 2, 25. § 6, iii. 13. § 6.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fabulae&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 63.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Perseus grows up to be a hero, killing [[Medusa (mythology)|Medusa]] and rescuing [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]]. Perseus and Danaë return to Argos with Andromeda, but King Acrisius has gone to [[Larissa]]. When Perseus arrives in Larissa, he participates in some funeral games and accidentally strikes Acrisius on the head with a [[discus]], killing him and fulfilling the prophecy.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;DicGRBM&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Citation

==Founder of Delphic amphictyony==
According to the [[Scholiast]] on [[Euripides]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Euripides]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1087.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Acrisius was the founder of the [[Delphi]]c [[Amphictyonic League|amphictyony]].  Strabo believes that this amphictyony existed before the time of Acrisius,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Strabo]], ix. p. 420.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and that he was only the first who regulated the affairs of the amphictyons, fixed the towns which were to take part in the council, gave to each its vote, and settled the jurisdiction of the amphictyons.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Comp. Libanius, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Orat.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; vol. iii. 472, ed. Reiske.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
