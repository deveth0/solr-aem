        text="&lt;p&gt;Over the course of [[English parliamentary history]] there were a number of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Acts of Uniformity&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. All had the basic object of establishing some sort of religious [[orthodoxy]] within the [[Church of England|English church]].

*The [[Act of Uniformity 1549]] (2 &amp;amp; 3 [[Edward VI of England|Edw. 6]], c. 1) which established the [[Book of Common Prayer]] as the only legal form of worship.
*The [[Act of Uniformity 1552]] (5 &amp;amp; 6 [[Edward VI of England|Edw. 6]], c. 1) required the use of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of 1552.
*The [[Act of Uniformity 1559]] (1 [[Elizabeth I of England|Eliz.]], c. 2) was adopted on the accession of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;See [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
*The [[Act of Uniformity 1662]] (13 &amp;amp; 14 [[Charles II of England|Ch. 2]], c. 4) was enacted after the [[English Restoration|restoration of the monarchy]]. It required the use of all the rites and ceremonies in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of 1662 in church services.
*The [[Act of Uniformity (Explanation) Act 1663]] (15 Car 2 c 6)

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;(The &amp;apos;13&amp;amp;14 Ch. 2 c. 2&amp;apos; nomenclature is reference to the statute book of the numbered year of the reign of the named King in the stated chapter. This is the method used for [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] from before 1962.)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
