&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Achsah&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|k|s|ə}}; Hebrew: עַכְסָה) - &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;anklet&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was [[Caleb|Caleb ben Yefune]]&amp;apos;s only daughter (1 Chr. 2:49). She was offered in [[marriage]] to the man who would lead an attack on the city of [[Debir]], also called [[Kirjath-sepher]]/[[Kirjath-sannah]]. This was done by [[Othniel]], Caleb&amp;apos;s brother&amp;apos;s son, who accordingly obtained her as his wife ([[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 15:16-19; [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 1:9-15).

Achsah later requests, and is given, upper and lower springs of water (presumably in the [[Negev]]) from her father. (Judges 1:14-15)

To highlight her cleverness (both at negotiations and awareness of prime real estate), some references state that she demands this of her father &amp;quot;all without getting off her ass&amp;quot; (presumably the image is that she is loaded on her donkey off to be wed but the modern day double entendre is appreciated).
