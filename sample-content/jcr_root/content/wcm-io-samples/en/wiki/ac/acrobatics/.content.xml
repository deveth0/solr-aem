&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Acrobatics&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀκροβατέω - &amp;apos;&amp;apos;akrobateō&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;walk on tiptoe, strut&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29krobate%2Fw ἀκροβατέω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Greek-English Lexicon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, on Perseus&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) is the performance of extraordinary feats of [[balance (ability)|balance]], [[agility]], and [[motor coordination]]. It can be found in many of the [[performing arts]] as well as in many [[sport]]s. Acrobatics is most often associated with activities that make extensive use of gymnastic elements, such as [[acro dance]], [[circus]], and [[gymnastics]], but many other athletic activities — such as [[ballet]] and [[diving]] — may also employ acrobatics. Although acrobatics is most commonly associated with human body performance, it may also apply to other types of performance, such as [[aerobatics]].

==History==

[[File:Hydria acrobat BM VaseF232.jpg|thumb|170px|A female acrobat depicted on an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[hydria]], ca. 340-330 BC.]]
Acrobatic traditions are found in many cultures. [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] art from circa 2000 BC contains depictions of acrobatic feats on the backs of bulls, which may have been a [[ritual|religious ritual]]. [[Ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] practised acrobatics and the [[noble court]] displays of the [[Europe]]an [[Middle Ages]] would often include acrobatic performances along with [[song]], [[juggling]] and other activities.

In [[China]], acrobatics have been a part of the culture since the [[Han Dynasty|Western Han Dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD). Acrobatics were part of village harvest [[festival]]s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.redpanda2000.com/history.htm redpanda2000]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; During the [[Tang Dynasty]], acrobatics saw much the same sort of development as European acrobatics saw during the Middle Ages, with court displays during the 7th through 10th century dominating the practice.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.pasadena.edu/chinese/cultural/acrobatics.html Pasadena.edu]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Acrobatics continues to be an important part of modern [[Chinese variety art]].

Though the term initially applied to tightrope walking, in the 19th century, a form of performance art including [[circus]] acts began to use the term as well. In the late 19th century, tumbling and other acrobatic and gymnastic activities became competitive sport in Europe.

Acrobatics has often served as a subject for fine art. Examples of this are paintings such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Impressionist]] [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], which depicts two German acrobatic sisters, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[:File:Vasnetsov Acrobats.jpg|Acrobats in a Paris suburb]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]].

==Education==

Traditionally, acrobatic skills were kept within families and passed from parents to children. This is still true especially among family [[circus]] groups, although most acrobats are now taught by larger scale education systems as circuses are now made up of many more professionals than they used to be. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Schools that specialize in acrobatics training provide a constant flow of new acrobatic artists. Some of these schools are independently operated, and some are supported and affiliated with circuses.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}{{clear}}
