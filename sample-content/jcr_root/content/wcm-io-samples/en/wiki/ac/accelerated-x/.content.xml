&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Accelerated-X&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a proprietary port of the [[X Window System]] to Intel x86 machines.  As of 2013, its website&amp;apos;s domain name has expired and the product appears to be abandoned.

==History==
The Accelerated-X server was built on top of the [[X386]] X server that was created by Thomas Roell for X11 Release 5. He founded a company in [[Colorado]] named Xi Graphics which provided support for the software.

The [[XFree86]] project was created as a free alternative to what became the Accelerated-X server.

==Features==
Accelerated-X server provided an &amp;quot;overlay mode&amp;quot; on several [[graphics card]]s which allowed running ancient, 256 color mode-only Unix alongside more modern applications on [[True Color|truecolor]] 24-bit displays.

It provided much better driver support (hardware acceleration, 3D and compatibility, especially on integrated graphics) than XFree86, at a time when the major graphics chipset vendors were not supporting [[GNU/Linux]] officially.
