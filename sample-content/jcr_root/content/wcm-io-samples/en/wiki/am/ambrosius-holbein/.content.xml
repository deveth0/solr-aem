&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ambrosius Holbein&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (c. 1494 – c. 1519) was a [[Germany|German]] and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] artist in painting, [[drawing]] and [[printmaking]]. He was the elder brother, by about three years, of [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], but he appears to have died in his mid twenties leaving behind only a small body of work.

==Biography==
Like his brother, he was born in [[Augsburg]] (which today is in [[Bavaria]], but then was a [[free imperial city]]), a center of art, culture and trade at that time. His father [[Hans Holbein the Elder]] was a pioneer and leader in the transformation of German art from the [[Gothic art|Gothic]] to the [[Renaissance]] style.  In his studio both his sons, Ambrosius and Hans, received their first painting lessons as well as the an introduction to the crafts of the [[goldsmith]], jeweller and printmaker.

In 1515 Ambrosius lived in the Swiss town of [[Stein am Rhein]], where he helped a [[Schaffhausen]] painter named Thomas Schmid with the murals in the main hall of the St George monastery. The next year saw Ambrosius, as well as his brother Hans, in [[Basel]], where he initially worked as a [[journeyman]] in Hans Herbster’s studio. In 1517 he was enrolled in a register of the Basel [[painters&amp;apos; guild]] and in 1518 he was naturalized as a citizen there. However he disappears from records soon after, and is assumed to have died around 1519.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Wilson, Derek. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hans Holbein: Portrait of an Unknown Man&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. London: Pimlico, Revised Edition, 200, pp. 69–70. Wilson cautions against too readily accepting that Ambrosius died, since other explanations for his disappearance from the record are possible. However, only Hans Holbein claimed their father&amp;apos;s estate when he died in 1524.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Portrait of a Boy with Blond Hair&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and its companion, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Portrait of a Boy with Brown Hair&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, are among Ambrosius’ best works of this period. Both are now in the [[Basel Kunstmuseum]].

Ambrosius Holbein ranks among the most important of Basel&amp;apos;s illustrators and prominent &amp;quot;small format&amp;quot; artists.
