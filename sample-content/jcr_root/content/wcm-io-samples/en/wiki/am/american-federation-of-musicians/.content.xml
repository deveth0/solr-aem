The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AFM&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;/&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AFofM&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[trade union|labor union]] of [[profession]]al [[musician]]s in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. They the largest organization in the world representing the interests of professional musicians. They accomplish this by negotiating fair agreements, protecting ownership of recorded music, securing benefits such as health care and pension, and lobbying legislators. In deference to the differing laws and cultural attributes of each country, in the US it is referred to as the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) and in Canada as the Canadian Federation of Musicians/Fédération canadienne des musiciens (CFM/FCM). &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web

The American Federation of Musicians was founded in 1896, at which time it took over from an older and looser organization of local musicians unions, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;National League of Musicians&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Among the most famous actions by the AFM was a ban on all commercial recording by members in [[1942-44 musicians&amp;apos; strike|1942–44]], in order to pressure [[record label|record companies]] to make a better arrangement for paying royalties to recording artists.  This was sometimes called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Petrillo Ban&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, because [[James Petrillo]] was the newly–elected head of the union. Petrillo also organized a second recording ban in 1948 (from January 1 to December 14), in response to the [[Taft–Hartley Act]].
