[[File:Death of Amasa.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Woodcut by [[Johann Christoph Weigel]] depicting the death of Amasa, 1695.]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Amasa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a person in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. He was the son of [[Abigail (mother of Amasa)|Abigail]] ({{bibleverse|2|Sam|17:25|HE}}), who was sister to King [[David]] ({{bibleverse|1|Chr|2:16,17|HE}}) and [[Zeruiah]], the mother of [[Joab]]. Hence, Amasa was a nephew to David, a cousin to Joab, as well as a cousin to [[Absalom]].

Absalom, David&amp;apos;s mutinous son, revolted and won over the tribes of Israel ({{bibleverse|2|Sam|15|HE}}). He appointed Amasa over the army, in effect replacing Joab, who had been general for Absalom&amp;apos;s father David.

After the revolt was crushed, David held out an olive branch to Amasa (in a likely effort to appease and reunite Judah with the other 10 tribes of Israel) by offering to appoint Amasa as his new army commander ({{bibleverse|2|Sam|19:13|HE}}). While being fiercely loyal to David, Joab was also suspicious of any potential rivals for [[Joab]]&amp;apos;s power or threats to David&amp;apos;s kingdom, and had no qualms about taking the lives of any who might stand in his way (E.G., [[Abner]]: {{bibleverse|2|Sam|3:27|HE}}, and Absalom: {{bibleverse|2|Sam|18:14|HE}}). So it was not difficult for Joab to also decide to murder Amasa ({{bibleverse|2|Sam|20:10|HE}}, {{bibleverse|1|Kin|2:5,32|HE}}). Joab&amp;apos;s own justification for killing Amasa may have been because  he believed Amasa to be conspiring with [[Sheba]] the Benjamite, due to Amasa&amp;apos;s slowness to mobilize the army against Sheba&amp;apos;s rebels ({{bibleverse|2|Sam|20:4,5|HE}}).
