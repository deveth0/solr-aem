The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Commodore Amiga 3000UX&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a model of the [[Commodore Amiga|Amiga]] computer family that was released with [[Amiga Unix]], a full port of AT&amp;amp;T [[Unix]] System V Release 4 (SVR4), installed along with AmigaOS. The system was otherwise equivalent to the standard [[Amiga 3000|A3000]], once the Right-Mouse-Button initiated a boot to [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] (Amiga&amp;apos;s BIOS).

At one point, [[Sun Microsystems]] approached Commodore-Amiga Inc. with the offer to produce the A3000UX under license as a low- to mid-range alternative to their high-end Sun [[workstations]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.amiga-hardware.com/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=29&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  That this offer was declined was one of the many management decisions that led to the popular belief that [[Amiga]] would have been a real success story but for the [[Commodore International|Commodore]] management.

It is possible that Commodore (or a third party) repurposed A3000UX machines for standard AmigaOS, as some standard A3000 models have been found with labeling suggesting they were originally to be sold as A3000UX machines.
