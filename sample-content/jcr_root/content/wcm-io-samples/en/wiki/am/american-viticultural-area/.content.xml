        text="&lt;p&gt;An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;American Viticultural Area&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a designated [[wine]] [[grape]]-growing region in the [[United States]] distinguishable by [[geography|geographic]] features, with boundaries defined by the [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] (TTB), [[United States Department of the Treasury]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.ttb.gov/appellation/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The TTB defines AVAs at the request of [[winery|wineries]] and other [[petition]]ers.  There were 206 AVAs as of October 2012.{{Update after|2013|10}}&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://www.ttb.gov/appellation/us_by_ava.pdf U.S. Viticultural Areas]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Updated as of 10/18/2012&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Prior to the installation of the AVA system, wine [[appellation]]s of origin in the United States were designated based on [[U.S. state|state]] or [[U.S. county|county]] boundaries. All of these appellations were [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] into federal law and may appear on wine labels as designated places of origin, but these appellations are distinct from AVAs.

American Viticultural Areas range in size from the [[Upper Mississippi Valley AVA]] at {{convert|29900|sqmi|km2|-3}} across four states, to the [[Cole Ranch AVA]] in [[Mendocino County wine|Mendocino County]], [[California]], at only {{convert|62|acre|ha|0}}. The [[Augusta AVA]] near the town of [[Augusta, Missouri]], was the first recognized AVA, gaining the status on June 20, 1980.&amp;lt;ref name=ATF&amp;gt;Code of Federal Regulations [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/get-cfr.cgi?TITLE=27&amp;amp;PART=9&amp;amp;SECTION=22&amp;amp;TYPE=TEXT Title 27, Volume 1] ALCOHOL, TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND FIREARMS&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Unlike most [[Europe]]an wine appellations of origin, an AVA specifies only a geographical location from which at least 85% of the grapes used to make a wine must have been grown.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  AVAs are more similar to the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Indicazione Geografica Tipica]] than other European appellation of origin systems.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  American Viticultural Area designations do not limit the type of grapes grown, the method of [[vinification]], or the crop yield.  Some of those factors may, however, be used by the petitioner to justify uniqueness of place when proposing a new AVA.{{citation needed| date=January 2011}}

== Requirements ==
Current regulations impose the following additional requirements on an AVA:{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
* Evidence that the name of the proposed new AVA is locally or nationally known as referring to the area;
* Historical or current evidence that the boundaries are legitimate;
* Evidence that growing conditions such as [[climate]], [[soil]], [[elevation]], and physical features are distinctive;

Petitioners are required to provide such information when applying for a new AVA, and are also required to use [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] [[map]]s to both describe (using terms from the map) and depict the boundaries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Once an AVA is established, at least 85% of the grapes used to make a wine must be grown in the specified area if an AVA is referenced on its label.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.ttb.gov/appellation/#requirement Requirement]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

State or county boundaries &amp;amp;mdash; such as for [[Oregon wine|Oregon]] or [[Sonoma County wine|Sonoma County]] &amp;amp;mdash; are not AVAs, even though they are used to identify the source of a wine. AVAs are reserved for situations where a geographically defined area has been using the name and it has come to be identified with that area.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

A vineyard may be in more than one AVA.  For example, the [[Santa Clara Valley AVA]] and [[Livermore Valley AVA]]s are located within the territory of the [[San Francisco Bay AVA]], which is itself located within the [[Central Coast AVA]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
