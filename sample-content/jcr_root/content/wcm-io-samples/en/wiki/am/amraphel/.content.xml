In the [[Tanakh]] or [[Old Testament]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Amraphel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a king of [[Shinar]] ([[Sumer]] / Senaar, or Babylonia broadly speaking) in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Genesis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; xiv.1 and 9, who invaded the west along with [[Chedorlaomer]], king of [[Elamite Empire|Elam]], and others, and defeated [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] and the other [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Cities of the Plain]] in the [[Battle of the Vale of Siddim]].

Beginning with E. Schrader (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Old Testament,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; vol II (1888), pp 299ff) this king was usually associated with [[Hammurabi]], who ruled in [[Babylon]] from 1792 BC until his death in 1750 BC. However, according to The Oxford Companion to the Bible, this view has been largely abandoned in recent years.

At an earlier time, it was fashionable to identify Amraphel with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aralius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, one of the names on the later [[List of kings of Babylon|Babylonian king-lists]], attributed first to [[Ctesias]]. According to [[John Van Seters]] in [[Abraham in History and Tradition (book)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Abraham in History and Tradition&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], the existence of Amraphel is unconfirmed by any sources outside the Bible.

In the [[Midrash]] (Tanchuma Lekh Lekhah 6) and later Rabbinical literature, Amraphel was identified with [[Nimrod (king)|Nimrod]] (this is also attested to in the 11th Chapter of the [[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Book of Jasher]]).

&amp;quot;And Nimrod dwelt in Babel, and he there renewed his reign over the rest of his subjects, and he reigned securely, and the subjects and princes of Nimrod called his name Amraphel, saying that at the tower his princes and men fell through his means.  -Book of the Upright (Jasher) 11
