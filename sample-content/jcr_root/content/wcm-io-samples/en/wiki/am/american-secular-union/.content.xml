The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;American Secular Union&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a social movement from the 19th century in the [[United States]].

After the implosion of the [[National Liberal League (United States)|National Liberal League]], the [[Liberalism|Liberals]] reorganized as a nonpolitical American Secular Union.  Colonel [[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Green Ingersoll]] served as one of its first presidents.

The American Secular Union and [[Freethought Federation]] were dedicated to the [[separation of church and state]], and for its platform used the nine demands of liberalism, namely:

#that churches and other ecclesiastical property shall be no longer [[Tax exemption|exempt from taxation]];
#that the employment of [[chaplain]]s in the [[United States Congress]], in [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]]s in the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy]], and in [[prison]]s, [[Psychiatric hospital|asylums]], and all institutions supported by public money, shall be discontinued, and that all religious services maintained by national, state, or [[Local government in the United States|municipal governments]] shall be abolished;
#that all public appropriations for educational and charitable institutions of a sectarian character shall cease;
#that, while advocating the loftiest instruction in [[moral]]s and the inculcation of the strictest uprightness of conduct, religious teaching and the use of the Bible for religious purposes in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] shall be prohibited;
#that the appointment by the [[President of the United States]] and the [[Governor (United States)|governors]] of the various states of religious [[festival]]s, fasts, and days of [[prayer]] and [[thanksgiving]] shall be discontinued;
#that the theological [[oath]] in the courts and in other departments of government shall be abolished, and simple [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] under the pains and penalties of [[perjury]], established in its stead;
#that all [[Blue law|laws directly or indirectly enforcing]] in any degree the religious and theological [[dogma]] of Sunday or [[Christian Sabbath|Sabbath]] observance shall be repealed;
#that all laws looking to the enforcement of Christian morality as such shall be abrogated, and that all laws shall be conformed to the requirements of [[natural morality]], [[Civil rights|equal rights]] and impartial [[justice]];
#that, in harmony with the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] and the constitutions of the several states, no special privileges or advantages shall be conceded to Christianity or any other religion; that our entire political system shall be conducted and administered on a purely [[secular]] basis; and that whatever changes are necessary to this end shall be consistently, unflinchingly, and promptly made.
