&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ammonius Grammaticus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the supposed author of a treatise titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peri homoíōn kai diaphórōn léxeōn&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (περὶ ὁμοίων καὶ διαφόρων λέξεων, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;On the Differences of Synonymous Expressions&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), of whom nothing is known.

He was formerly identified with an [[Egypt]]ian priest who, after the destruction of the pagan temple at [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]] (389), fled to [[Constantinople]], where he became the tutor of the ecclesiastical historian [[Socrates Scholasticus|Socrates]].  But it seems more probable
that the real author was [[Herennius Philo]] of Byblus, who was born during the reign of [[Nero]] and lived till the reign of [[Hadrian]], and that the treatise in its present form is a revision prepared by a later Byzantine editor, whose name may have been Ammonius.
