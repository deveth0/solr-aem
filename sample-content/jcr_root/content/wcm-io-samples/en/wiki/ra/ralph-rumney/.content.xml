        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ralph Rumney&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (5 June 1934 – 6 March 2002) was an [[England|English]] artist, born in [[Newcastle Upon Tyne]].

In 1957 lifelong [[conscientious objector]] Rumney was one of the co-founders of the [[London Psychogeographical Association]]. This organization was, along with [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] and the [[Lettrist International]], involved in the formation of the [[Situationist International]]. Amongst those present at the founding in the [[Italy|Italian]] village of Cosio d&amp;apos;Arroscia were [[Walter Olmo]], [[Michèle Bernstein]] (to whom Rumney was later married), [[Asger Jorn]], and [[Guy Debord]]. However, within seven months Rumney had been &amp;apos;amiably&amp;apos; expelled from the SI by Debord for allegedly &amp;quot;failing to hand in a [[psychogeography]] report about [[Venice]] on time.&amp;quot;

Rumney spent much of his life living as a wanderer, and was variously described as both a &amp;apos;recluse&amp;apos; and a &amp;apos;media whore&amp;apos;, seeing his existence as a &amp;apos;permanent adventure and endless experiment.&amp;apos; He moved, as his friend Guy Atkins said, &amp;quot;between penury and almost absurd affluence. One visited him in a squalid room in [[London]]&amp;apos;s [[Neal Street]], in a house shared with near down-and-outs. Next, one would find him in Harry&amp;apos;s Bar in [[Venice]], or at a [[Max Ernst]] opening in [[Paris]]. He seemed to take poverty with more equanimity than riches.&amp;quot;

Ralph Rumney died of cancer at his home in [[Manosque]], [[Provence]], France, in 2002, aged 67.
