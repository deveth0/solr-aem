&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ravenstone&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[Milton Keynes (borough)|Borough of Milton Keynes]] and [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.milton-keynes.gov.uk/parishes/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=17026 Parishes in Milton Keynes] - Milton Keynes Council.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is located two and a half miles west of [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]], four miles north of [[Newport Pagnell]] (and of the northern boundary of [[Milton Keynes]] itself).

The village name is an [[Old English language]] word, and means &amp;apos;Hrafn&amp;apos;s farm&amp;apos;.

In 1255 a [[priory]] of [[Augustinian]] [[Canon (priest)|canon]]s was founded in Ravenstone by [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]].  Later, in 1525 it was taken over by [[Cardinal Wolsey]] but seized by [[the Crown]] in 1544 along with the rest of Wolsey&amp;apos;s possessions.  After changing hands privately a number of occasions the building was eventually demolished, and today nothing remains.

The [[parish]] church in Ravenstone is dedicated to [[All Saints&amp;apos; Day|All Saints]]. It contains the tomb of [[Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Heanage Finch]], the 1st Earl of Nottingham. He also built the neighbouring almshouses, originally 6 for men and 6 for women, now converted to 6 cottages. The original inhabitants had to be single and members of the Church of England, and received a small pension, firewood, and a new cloak every Christmas.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Page 72 of &amp;quot;Olney and District in Camera&amp;quot; by E. Knight and G. Osborn, published by Quotes Limited of Buckingham, 1992&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The church was also presided over for a brief period by [[Thomas Scott (commentator)|Thomas Scott]], author of popular theological works and one of the founders of the [[Church Missionary Society]].

The only communal facility in the village is a village hall. A post office and The Wheatsheaf pub closed in the early 1990s.
