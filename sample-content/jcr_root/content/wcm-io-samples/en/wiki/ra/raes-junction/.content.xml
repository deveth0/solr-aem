&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Raes Junction&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small settlement in [[New Zealand]], located at the intersection of [[New Zealand State Highway 8|State Highways 8]] and [[New Zealand State Highway 90|90]], in the lower [[South Island]]. The highways which meet at the junction are the main routes to the [[Clutha River|Clutha]] valley for travellers from [[Dunedin]] and [[Invercargill]] respectively.

Raes Junction is 62 kilometres by road from [[Milton, New Zealand|Milton]], 67 from [[Gore, New Zealand|Gore]], and 72&amp;amp;nbsp;km from [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]]. The junction lies three kilometres to the south of the Clutha River. The nearest town of any significant size is [[Lawrence, New Zealand|Lawrence]], which is 25 kilometres to the southeast.

Although the settlement itself is little more than a farming and horticultural community, its location at this mid-way junction is thus of considerable regional importance, as is the larger settlement of [[Beaumont, New Zealand|Beaumont]], some six kilometres to the southeast. The settlement consists of a mere five families, who occupy four local farms and the settlement&amp;apos;s most well-known feature, the Raes Junction Hotel.
