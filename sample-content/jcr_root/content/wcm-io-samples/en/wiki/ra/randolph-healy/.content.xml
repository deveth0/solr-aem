        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Randolph Healy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1956) is an [[Irish poetry|Irish poet]] and publisher.

Healy was born in [[Scotland]] and moved to [[Dublin]] at the age of  18 months. After leaving school at the age of 14 to work in a number of jobs, he returned to full-time education and graduated in mathematical sciences from  [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. He now works as a teacher of mathematics at second level. His poetry is marked by the frequent use of structural devices derived from logic and scientific diction and information.

Like many Irish poets, he has written work that touches on issues of the politics of language.  He is unique, though, in that he takes sign language and deafness as his points of departure in addressing these matters.

His books include &amp;apos;&amp;apos;25 Poems&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1983), &amp;apos;&amp;apos; Rana Rana!&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1997). &amp;apos;&amp;apos; Arbor Vitae&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1997), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Flame&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1998) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Selected Poems&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2000). He runs the publishing house Wild Honey Press.
