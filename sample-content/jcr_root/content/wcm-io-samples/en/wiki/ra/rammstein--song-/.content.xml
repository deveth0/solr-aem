&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rammstein&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; is a song by the [[Germany|German]] [[industrial metal]] band [[Rammstein]]. It is the eleventh and final track on their debut album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Herzeleid]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and was the first song written by the band. It is about the [[Ramstein air show disaster]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://herzeleid.com/en/faq/herzeleid#faq3&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; According to an interview with [[rhythm guitarist]] [[Paul Landers]], the sound of the main [[riff]] of the song is made by him and [[lead guitarist]] [[Richard Kruspe]], each playing a similar riff with different octaves (Richard plays the middle and Paul plays the lower).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=wSdXw8KSTMk&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The song was featured in the 1997 [[David Lynch]] film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Live aus Berlin]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; performance of the song, [[lead vocalist]] [[Till Lindemann]] ascends from underneath the stage via a trap door. He wears a burning coat, and special goggles from which a laser beam is projected from one of the lenses. When they performed the song in the 2004–05 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reise, Reise&amp;apos;&amp;apos; tour, Till no longer wore the flaming jacket, opting instead for dual arm mounted flame throwers.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://en.rammstein-europe.com/rammstein-videos/rammstein/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Rammstein has been a part of every tour setlist since the song&amp;apos;s inception, including the Pre-&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herzeleid&amp;apos;&amp;apos; years. The only tour it has not been included in is the tour for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Liebe ist für alle da]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and [[Made in Germany 1995–2011 (tour)|Made in Germany 1995–2011]], although on the latter tour, the introduction of the song has been used to tease the audience, cutting into [[Buck Dich]], just before the vocals enter.
