&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Raymond Duchamp-Villon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (5 November 1876 - 9 October 1918) was a [[France|French]] sculptor.

Duchamp-Villon was born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pierre-Maurice-Raymond Duchamp&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Damville]], [[Eure]], in the [[Haute-Normandie]] region of [[France]], the second son of Eugene and Lucie Duchamp. Of the six Duchamp children, four would become successful artists. He was the brother of:
*[[Jacques Villon]] (1875–1963), painter, printmaker
*[[Marcel Duchamp]]  (1887–1968), painter, sculptor and author
*[[Suzanne Duchamp|Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti]] (1889–1963), painter

From 1894 to 1898 Raymond Duchamp-Villon lived in the [[Montmartre]] Quarter of [[Paris]] with his brother Jacques and studied medicine at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. Rheumatic fever forced him to abandon his studies in 1898 and it left him partially incapacitated for a time. This unforeseen event altered the course of his life as he began to pursue an interest in sculpture. He started by creating small statuettes and essentially became self-taught, achieving a high level of mastery and acumen. In 1902 and 1903, he exhibited at the Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts but to distinguish himself from his artist brother, he began to use the Duchamp-Villon designation on all his works.

In 1905 Duchamp-Villon had his first exhibition at the [[Salon d&amp;apos;Automne]] and a show at the Galerie Legrip in [[Rouen]] with his brother Jacques. Two years later they moved to the village of [[Puteaux]] at the outskirts of Paris where the three Duchamp brothers were part of the regular meetings of what became known as the [[Puteaux Group]] of artists and critics. Raymond&amp;apos;s reputation was such that he was made a member of the jury of the sculpture section of the Salon d&amp;apos;Automne in 1907 and was instrumental in promoting the [[Cubism|Cubist]] movement.

In 1911 he exhibited at the Galerie de l’Art Contemporain in Paris and the following year his work was included in a show organized by the Duchamp brothers at the Salon de la Section d’Or at the Galerie de la Boétie. All three of the Duchamp brothers then showed their work at the important [[Armory Show]] in [[New York City]] that helped introduce [[modern art]] to [[United States|America]].

In 1913 he took part in exhibitions at the Galerie André Groult in Paris, the Galerie [[Mánes Union of Fine Arts|S. V. U. Mánes]] in [[Prague]], and in 1914 at [[Der Sturm Gallery]] in [[Berlin]]. During [[World War I]] Raymond Duchamp-Villon served in the French army in a medical capacity, but still worked on his major [[cubist sculpture]], [http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/5580 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Horse&amp;apos;&amp;apos;].

In late 1916, Raymond Duchamp-Villon contracted [[typhoid fever]] while stationed at the military quarters in [[Champagne, France|Champagne]]. As a result, he was taken to the military hospital at [[Cannes]] where his burgeoning career came to an end with his death.

In 1967, in [[Rouen]], his last surviving artist brother Marcel helped organize an exhibition called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Les Duchamp: Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Suzanne Duchamp.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Some of this family exhibition was later shown at the Musée National d&amp;apos;Art Moderne in Paris.
