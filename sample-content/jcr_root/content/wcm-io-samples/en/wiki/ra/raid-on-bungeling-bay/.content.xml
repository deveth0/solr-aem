[[Image:Raid on bungeling bay.gif|thumb|left|The [[Commodore 64]] version of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Raid on Bungeling Bay&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Raid on Bungeling Bay&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the first [[video game]] [[game designer|designed]] by [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]].  It was [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Brøderbund]] for the [[Commodore 64]] in 1984 and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[MSX]] computers in 1985. The Commodore 64 version was published in the UK by [[Ariolasoft]], and the NES version was ported by [[Hudson Soft]].

Apart from offering a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] overhead view of terrain which was a bit more complex than in other games, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Raid on Bungeling Bay&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was basically a simple war zone [[shoot &amp;apos;em up]].  The player controlled a [[helicopter]] that launches from an [[aircraft carrier]] to bomb six [[factories]] scattered across islands on a small planetoid occupied by the [[Bungeling Empire]] (the usual villains in Brøderbund games), while fending off escalating counterattacks by [[Turret#Gun turrets|gun turret]]s, [[fighter jet]]s, [[guided missile]]s, and a [[battleship]]. There was also a hidden island for the player to reload on. Failure meant that the Bungeling Empire develops a war machine to take over the planet [[Earth]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.flashingblade.net/?page_id=1544| title = Bungeling Empire&amp;apos;s War Machine | publisher = Flashing Blade| date = | accessdate = 2010-06-08}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Players had to attack its [[infrastructure]] while defending the [[aircraft carrier]] which served as home base.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;giantbomb&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.giantbomb.com/bungeling-empire/92-3144/| title = General information about the Bungeling Empire | publisher = Giant Bomb| date = | accessdate = 2010-06-08}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The game offers an interesting insight into the design style of [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]], who would later go on to design &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The islands and factories in the game behaved in a sophisticated manner which closely resembled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;SimCity&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Over time, the factories would grow and develop new technologies to use against the player. There were also visible signs of interdependency among the islands, such as supply boats moving between them. In order to win the game, the player must prevent the escalation by bombing all the factories as quickly as possible, keeping them from advancing their technology. If left alone for too long, the factories would create enough new weaponry to overwhelm the player.

==Legacy==
Wright continued to develop the editor for the game as a personal toy because he enjoyed it so much. He researched [[urban planning]] and realised that others might enjoy constructing and building cities themselves. The result was a fancier [[Simulation game|simulation]] that eventually became &amp;apos;&amp;apos;SimCity&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref name=gg&amp;gt;{{cite episode |title=Interview with Will Wright |episodelink= |series=Good Game  |serieslink= |airdate=2008-03-10  |season=4  |number=5 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
