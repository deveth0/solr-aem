&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (21 March 1846 - 23 January 1905) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] artist known for his illustration, [[caricature]]s, sculpture and ceramics designs, and is considered the first Portuguese [[Comic book creator|comics creator]].

== Life ==
He was a disciple of his father, the painter Manuel Maria Bordalo Pinheiro. His mother was D. Maria Augusta do Ó Carvalho Prostes and his brother the painter [[Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro|Columbano]]. He started publishing illustrations and caricatures in humoristic magazines such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Berlinda&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;O Calcanhar de Aquiles&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, frequently demonstrating a sarcastic humour with a political or social message.

In 1875 he travelled to [[Brazil]] to work as an illustrator and cartoonist for the publication &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mosquito&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (and later,another publication called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;O Besouro&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), which was also employing the Italian/Brazilian illustrator [[Angelo Agostini]], until then the unrivaled cartooning authority of Brazil.&amp;lt;ref name=jcarlos&amp;gt;{{Cite web|last= Lustosa, Isabel and Britto, Paulo Henriques |title=The Art of J. Carlos, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|year=1995|url= http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0888-7314%281995%2921%3C108%3ATAOJC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-P&amp;amp;size=LARGE&amp;amp;origin=JSTOR-enlargePage}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Pinheiro eventually became editor of other humorous, politically critical magazines. His fame as a caricaturist led the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Illustrated London News&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to become one of his collaborators.

In 1875, Bordalo Pinheiro created the [[cartoon]] character [[Zé Povinho]], a Portuguese [[everyman]], portrayed as a poor peasant. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zé Povinho&amp;apos;&amp;apos; became, and still is, as an iconic symbol, the most popular character in Portugal.

In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zé Povinho&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as in his other works, Bordalo Pinheiro&amp;apos;s drawing style was innovative and influential, making extensive use of [[onomatopoeia]], graphical signs (such as those to used represent movement), strong images (the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;manguito&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), and his unique style of mixing punctuation marks, such as brackets, with drawing.

== Pottery ==
In 1885, he founded a ceramics factory in [[Caldas da Rainha]], where he created many of the pottery designs for which this city is known.  The factory is still in business.

==Legacy==
The [[Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro Museum]] in [[Lisbon]] is dedicated to his life and works.
