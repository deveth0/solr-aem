&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ramanathan V. Guha&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1965) is a [[computer scientist]]. He graduated with B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) from [[Indian Institute of Technology Madras]], MS from [[University of California Berkeley]] and Ph.D from [[Stanford University]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Entry for Ramanathan Guha at the Mathematics Genealogy Project|publisher=http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=61946|accessdate=Feb. 4, 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Ramanathan Guha&amp;apos;s Curriculum Vitae|url=http://www.guha.com/cv.html}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Since May 2005, he has been working at [[Google]]. Guha was one of the early co-leaders of the [[Cyc]] Project where he worked from 1987 through 1994 at [[Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation]]. He was responsible for the design and implementation of key parts of the Cyc system, including the [[CycL]] [[knowledge representation]] language, the upper ontological layers of the Cyc Knowledge Base and some parts of the original Cyc Natural Language understanding system.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Publications of Ramanathan Guha at the DBLP Bibliography Server|url=http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/pers/hd/g/Guha:Ramanathan_V=.html|accessdate=Feb. 4, 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Leaving what became [[Cycorp]], Guha founded Q Technology, which created a database schema mapping tool called Babelfish.  In 1994, he moved to work at [[Apple Computer]], reporting to [[Alan Kay]], where he developed the [[Meta Content Framework]] (MCF) format. In 1997 he joined [[Netscape Corporation]] where together with [[Tim Bray]], he created a new version of MCF that used the [[XML]] language and which became the main technical precursor to W3C&amp;apos;s  [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF) standard.

Guha also contributed to the &amp;quot;smart browsing&amp;quot; features of Netscape 4.5 and was instrumental in Netscape&amp;apos;s acquisition of the [[Open Directory Project]]. In March 1999, he created the first version of RSS as part of Netscape&amp;apos;s personalized home page project. In 1999 he left Netscape and in May co-founded [[Epinions]] where he worked until 2000.  Guha founded [[Alpiri]] in late 2000 which created [[The Alpiri Project|TAP]], a [[semantic web]] application and [[knowledge base]].  In 2002, he became a researcher at [[IBM Almaden Research Center]].

In 2005 Guha joined [[Google]] and is currently a Google Fellow. While at Google he has been responsible for [[Google Custom Search]] and a number of enhancements to [[Adwords]]. He is also one of the founders of [[Schema.org]].

On January 26, 2013, Guha  was named as a Distinguished Alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=IIT-M announces awards for distinguished alumni|url=http://newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/article1438339.ece|accessdate=Feb 4, 2013|newspaper=The New Indian Express|date=Jan 28, 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
