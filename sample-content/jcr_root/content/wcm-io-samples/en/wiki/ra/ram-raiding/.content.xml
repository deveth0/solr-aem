&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ram-raiding&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a variation on [[burglary]] in which a [[van]], [[SUV]], car, or other heavy vehicle is driven through the windows or doors of a closed shop, usually a [[department store]] or [[jeweller]]s shop, to allow the perpetrators to loot it.

==Overview==
This act has occurred since at least the mid-1930s. The term came into widespread use after a series of such raids in [[Belfast]] in 1979 that was covered in news reports and in countries such as Australia that inspired a series of similar crimes.

Notably, large trucks are used to break into technology companies and steal high-value equipment for resale on the [[black market]].

Commercial properties in areas prone to ram-raids often erect strong [[wiktionary:barrier|barriers]] or obstructions, such as [[bollard]]s, to discourage such attacks. [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] centres are also victims of ram-raiding.

Many companies have come up with solutions to ram-raiding.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/money/atm-ram-raiders-foiled/story-e6frezc0-1111117254514 &amp;apos;Raminator&amp;apos; foils ATM ram raids.] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Daily Telegraph.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 21 Aug. 2008.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Everything from electronic bollards to electronic barriers have been employed to keep property from the raiders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Another solution is security guards, but teams of &amp;quot;round the clock&amp;quot; security are expensive and often not the most economical way of dealing with ram-raiding.
