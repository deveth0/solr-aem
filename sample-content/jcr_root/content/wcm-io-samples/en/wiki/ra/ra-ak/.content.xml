&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Račak&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-sq|Reçak}}; {{lang-sr|Рачак, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Račak&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}) is a village in central [[Kosovo]] located at {{coord|42|25|46|N|21|00|59|E|}}. It became notorious in January 1999 after 45 people were killed in the village during the conflict between state security forces and Albanian guerrillas.

Prior to the summer of 1998, Račak had a population of around 2,000 people. Most of its population was displaced by fighting between government security forces and guerrillas from the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] in July 1998. By January 1999, about 350 people had returned to the village, according to the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE). On 16 January 1999, OSCE monitors found the bodies of 45 people in and around the village in what became widely known as the [[Račak massacre]]. Following the incident, for which the international community blamed the security forces, the remaining population fled and did not return until the end of the [[Kosovo War]] in June 1999.
