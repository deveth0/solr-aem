&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Radde&amp;apos;s  Warbler&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Phylloscopus schwarzi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a [[leaf warbler]] which breeds in [[Siberia]].  This warbler is strongly [[bird migration|migratory]] and winters in southeast [[Asia]].

This is a [[bird]] of open woodlands with some undergrowth near water. The nest is built low in a bush, and eggs are laid. Like most [[Old World warbler]]s, this small [[passerine]] is [[insectivorous]].

This small warbler is prone to vagrancy as far as western [[Europe]] in October, despite a 3000&amp;amp;nbsp;km distance from its breeding grounds. It has been recorded from the [[Copeland Islands|Copeland Bird Observatory]] in [[County Down]], [[Northern Ireland]] where it was first recorded for Northern Ireland in 2008.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Leonard, K. 2008 Annual Report for 2008. Copeland Bird Observatory p.51 - 52&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

This is a warbler similar in size to a [[Willow Warbler]]. The adult has an unstreaked brown back and buff underparts. There is a very long prominent whitish supercilium, and the pointed bill is thicker than that of the similar [[Dusky Warbler]]. The legs are paler than Dusky&amp;apos;s, and the feet look large, reflecting the more terrestrial lifestyle of this warbler. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. The call is a soft &amp;apos;&amp;apos;chick&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The binomial commemorates the German astronomer Ludwig Schwarz (1822-1894).
