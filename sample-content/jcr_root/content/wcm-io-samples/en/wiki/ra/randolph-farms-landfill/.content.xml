        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Randolph Farms Landfill&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 120 acre (486,000 mÂ²) [[landfill]] owned by the Balkema family of [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], located in [[Modoc, Indiana]]. In addition to Randolph County, it serves [[Delaware County, Indiana|Delaware]], [[Madison County, Indiana|Madison]], [[Jay County, Indiana|Jay]], [[Wayne County, Indiana|Wayne]], and [[Henry County, Indiana|Henry Counties]] in [[Indiana]], as well as [[Darke County, Ohio|Darke]] and [[Miami County, Ohio|Miami Counties]] in [[Ohio]].

The owners of the landfill are, as of June 22, 2004, petitioning the Randolph County [[Zoning|Board of Zoning Appeals]] to allow for an expansion, nearly three times its current size, in order that the landfill continue operation for another 50 years. Similar attempts at expansion were denied twice in the 1990s.

Opponents of expansion, in the majority in largely rural Randolph County, point out that only 6% of the trash in the landfill is from Randolph County, whereas most of it is from Miami County. The landfill could likely reach a height of 165 feet (50 m), which would make it not only one of the largest landfills in the state, but also the highest point of [[elevation]] in Indiana. The landfill would allegedly be visible for over a mile (2 km) away.

Randolph Farms was built on a [[limestone]] [[hill]], directly over sand and gravel [[aquifer]]s, near the [[drainage basin]]s  of [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] and [[Whitewater River (Indiana)|Whitewater River]].

Opponents, citing the previous denials of expansion, say it should again be denied due to [[groundwater]] [[contamination]], as well as increased traffic, odor, and lower [[aesthetics]] and [[property value]]s. [[Organic farming|Organic farmers]] have claimed that toxins could affect their produce yields.

In the mid 1990s, groundwater monitoring wells detected low levels of volatile [[organic compound]]s, due to the [[landfill gas]] produced by the landfill. Tests dating to 1999 show that the high permeability of the underground aquifer point to a high risk for [[water pollution]].
