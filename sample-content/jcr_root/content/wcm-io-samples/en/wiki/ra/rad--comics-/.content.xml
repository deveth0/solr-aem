&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Femforce]] comic published by [[A.C. Comics]].

Rad possesses superhuman strength, together with the ability to fly (although only over short distances). Her true identity was Jennifer Burke, daughter of the original [[Miss Victory]], who in the 1940s developed the &amp;quot;V-formula&amp;quot; to increase the strength/stamina of allied troops. The initial formula, V-45, turned Dan Barton, crack covert agent and boyfriend of Laura Wright, into the supervillain Black Commando. Joan Wayne was able to alter the formula, creating V-47, which only worked on herself and only for a short period of time, and she became the superheroine &amp;quot;Miss Victory&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.femforce-femfans.com/profiles/joan6.html |title= Ms.Victory Profile: AC Comics |accessdate=2008-03-05 |work=femforce-femfans.com AComics Profiles }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the 1980s, the Black Commando force-fed some of the V-45 to Joan. In addition to permanent superstrength and youth, she developed the same paranoia and [[narcissism]] that the Black Commando had. She took the name &amp;quot;Rad&amp;quot; and became a ruthless mercenary. Eventually, Femforce was able to expunge the V-45 from her system and restore Joan&amp;apos;s normal personality.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://rkscroy.tripod.com/msvictorygallery.htm |title=Ms. Victory Profile &amp;amp; Pinups |accessdate=2008-03-05 |work=Superbabes |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080123044913/http://rkscroy.tripod.com/msvictorygallery.htm &amp;lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&amp;gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-23}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the meantime, Joan Wayne was replaced by her grown-up daughter Jennifer Burke (the only other person on whom the V-47 would work) becoming the second Miss Victory. After the return of Joan Wayne to the Miss Victory codename, Jennifer Burke left [[Femforce]] and was chosen to lead the New [[Sentinels of Justice]] under the name of Paragon which was objected by the original [[Captain Paragon|Paragon]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = | Artist = | Story = | Title = Femforce | Volume = 1 | Issue = 59 | Date = 1996? | Publisher = [[AC Comics]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The combined stress of replacing her mother in Femforce, her son being killed by a villain, losing her husband to a team member, and then being replaced by her mother left Jennifer vulnerable to the machinations of the Shroud. Once again, she followed in her mother&amp;apos;s footsteps, taking the V-45 and becoming the new Rad.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.femforce-femfans.com/profiles/jen1.html |title= Her daughter, Jennifer |accessdate=2008-03-05 |work=femforce-femfans.com AComics Profiles }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
