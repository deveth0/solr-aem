&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Raufoss&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the municipal centre of [[Vestre Toten]], a municipality in the county of [[Oppland]], [[Norway]], 10 kilomenters south of the larger town [[Gjøvik]]. It has approximately 6,000 inhabitants. The largest employer is what was earlier Raufoss Ammunitions factory, now split into several sub companies. These include [[Nammo]], [[Norsk Hydro|Hydro Aluminium]] and [[Raufoss Technology]].
The community has an active sports community pivoting around the sports club [[Raufoss I.L.]] where the football team has been the most prominent part of the club. Raufoss Fotball currently plays in Norwegian 2. division.

Raufoss is also one of the stops on [[Gjøvikbanen]], the second to last stop. The station also has a local bus service.

==The name==
The village is named after a waterfall in the river [[Hunnselva]]. The first element is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;raud&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;red&amp;quot;), and the last element is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;foss&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;waterfall&amp;quot;). (The color red indicates traces of iron in the river bed.)
