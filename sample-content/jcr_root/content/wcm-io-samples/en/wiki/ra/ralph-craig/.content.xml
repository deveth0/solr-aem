&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ralph Cook Craig&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (June 21, 1889 &amp;amp;ndash; July 21, 1972) was an [[United States|American]] [[Athletics (sport)|athlete]], winner of the sprint double at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]].

Craig was born in [[Detroit, Michigan]]. Initially a [[hurdling|hurdler]], he developed into a sprinter at the [[University of Michigan]]. In 1910, he won the [[IC4A]] 220 y championship, repeating this the following year.

In 1912, Craig qualified for the Olympic team and went to [[Sweden]], where he reached the final of the [[100m]]. A big favourite was his compatriot [[Donald Lippincott]], who had set a World Record of 10,6 in the heats. After no less than seven false starts, Craig won the race in 10,8 - Lippincott only finished third. Craig fought out another battle with Lippincott in the [[200m]], edging him to win the 200 m title. Craig was not a part of the American 4 x 100 m relay team, which was disqualified and didn&amp;apos;t medal.

Immediately after the Olympics, Ralph Craig retired from the sport, although his brother, [[James B. Craig|Jimmy]], became an [[All American]] [[American football|footballer]] in 1913.

In 1948, he made a return to the Olympics as an alternate on the US [[yachting]] team. Although he did not actually compete, Craig (59) carried the American flag at the opening ceremonies in [[London]].

He died at [[Lake George (town), New York|Lake George, New York]].

In 2010 he joined the [[National Track and Field Hall of Fame]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.usatf.org/news/view.aspx?duid=USATF_2010_11_04_13_44_20&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

*In March 1911, Craig set a new record by running the 40-yard high hurdles in 5.2 seconds, breaking the prior record held by Forrest Smithson.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Cornell Defeats Michigan|publisher=Michigan Alumnus (p. 441)|date= April 1911|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=owwrAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;f=false}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
*In May 1911, at his last competition wearing the Michigan uniform, Craig helped the Wolverines to a third place finish in the inter-collegiate meet.  He tied the inter-collegiate record in the 100-yard dash with a time of 9.8 seconds.  He also tied the world record in the 220-yard dash with a time of 21.2 seconds.  The Wolverines finished the meet with 24 points, trailing only Cornell (30 points) and Yale (24-1/2 points).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan Third in Inter-Collegiate|publisher=Michigan Alumnus (p. 529)|date=June 1911|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=owwrAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;f=false}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
