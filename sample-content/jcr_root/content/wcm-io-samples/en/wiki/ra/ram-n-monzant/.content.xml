{{spanish name|Monzant|Espina}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ramón Segundo Monzant Espina&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (January 4, 1933 - August 10, 2001) was a right-handed [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]] for the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York]] and [[San Francisco Giants]] (1954–60).

Monzant was born in [[Maracaibo]], [[Venezuela]].  A [[curveball|curve]] specialist, he was supposed to join a pitching rotation which included veterans [[Johnny Antonelli]], [[Rubén Gómez (baseball)|Rubén Gómez]] and [[Sal Maglie]]. Unfortunately, he disappointed the Giants&amp;apos; great expectations for him. His main problem was staying focused in the game, and deciding whether to pitch for the Giants or stay in his homeland longer after the winter season. He was consistently late in reporting to spring training, claiming a variety of excuses.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The best performance by Monzant took place on April 29, 1956, in a Giants 8–1 victory over the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. Phillies outfielder [[Del Ennis]] spoiled a [[no-hitter]] by Monzant, though he finally won the game.

Monzant compiled a 16–21 record with a 4.38 [[earned run average|ERA]] and 201 [[strikeout]]s in 316.2 innings.
