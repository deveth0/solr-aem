&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rannoch Moor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{Pronunciation-needed}} ([[Scottish Gaelic]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mòinteach Raineach/Raithneach&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a large expanse of around 50&amp;amp;nbsp;square miles (130&amp;amp;nbsp;km²) of boggy [[moorland]] to the west of [[Loch Rannoch]] in [[Scotland]], where it extends into [[Perth and Kinross]], [[Lochaber]] in [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]], and northern [[Argyll and Bute]].  Rannoch Moor is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://gateway.snh.gov.uk/sitelink/index.jsp &amp;apos;&amp;apos;1331, 8348. Rannoch Moor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Scottish National Heritage Sitelink.] Scottish National Heritage. 2012.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

It is notable for its [[wildlife]], particularly famous for the sole British location for the [[Scheuchzeria|Rannoch-rush]], named after the moor. It was frequently visited by [[Horace Donisthorpe]], who collected many unusual species of ants on the moor and surrounding hilly ground. Today it is still one of the few remaining habitats for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Formica exsecta]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the &amp;quot;narrow-headed ant&amp;quot;, although recent surveys have failed to produce any sign of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Formica pratensis]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which Donisthorpe recorded in the area in the early part of the 20th century.

[[Peat]] deposits pose major difficulties to builders of roads and railways. When the [[West Highland Line]] was built across Rannoch Moor, its builders had to float the tracks on a mattress of tree roots, brushwood and thousands of tons of earth and ashes.

The [[A82 road]] crosses through Rannoch Moor on its way to [[Glen Coe]] and [[Fort William, Scotland|Fort William]]. Additionally, the West Highland Railway line crosses the moor. The railway rises to over 1300 feet and travels over 23 miles of moorland.

== Geography ==
This expanse was at the heart of the last significant icefield in the UK during the [[Loch Lomond Stadial]] at the end of the last ice age. Once the great mass of ice had melted, the subsequent unburdening of the Earth&amp;apos;s crust resulted in a continuing [[Post-glacial rebound|rise in the land]] which is estimated to be of the order of 2–3&amp;amp;nbsp;mm per year.

== In fiction ==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]].

According to [[Don Rosa]], [[Castle McDuck]], the ancestral home of [[Scrooge McDuck|Scrooge McDuck&amp;apos;s]] family, the [[Clan McDuck]] is located in [[Dismal Downs]] somewhere on Rannoch Moor.

In the [[Highlander (TV series)|Highlander]] novel, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Element of Fire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Duncan MacLeod|Duncan]] and [[Connor MacLeod]] track the antagonist Khordas to Rannoch Moor. There Duncan defeats Khordas&amp;apos; female companion, Nerissa.

In the 1996 film Trainspotting, Tommy and the gang get off an Intercity train to &amp;quot;get some fresh air&amp;quot; on a hike at [[Corrour railway station]], which is located on Rannoch Moor.

Ancestral seat of Lady Georgina of Rannoch, 34th in the line of succession, in Rhys Bowen&amp;apos;s  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Her Royal Spyness]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  (novel) series.
