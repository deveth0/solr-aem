&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rag Doll Kung Fu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Fighting game|fighting]] [[computer game]], created predominantly by artist [[Mark Healey]], while working for [[Lionhead Studios]], along with other Lionhead employees, such as David Smith and [[Alex Evans (video game developer)|Alex Evans]].  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rag Doll Kung Fu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is available from [[Valve Software|Valve]]&amp;apos;s [[Steam (software)|Steam]] content delivery platform. A new version, called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rag Doll Kung Fu: Fists of Plastic&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was made available for download on the [[PlayStation Network]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] on 9 April 2009.&amp;lt;ref name=PSNRelease&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediamolecule.com/2009/03/12/rag-doll-kungfu/|title=Rag Doll Kung Fu|publisher=Media Molecule}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Gameplay==
The game features string puppets that allow for complete control over their hands, arms, and the like. The game is written in [[C++]] and [[Direct3D]] though it is only played in two ([[2.5D|and a half]]) dimensions and exclusively with the mouse. RDKF uses multiple mice to implement multiplayer on a single machine, but this feature is limited to [[Windows XP]] due to the use of this [http://jstookey.com/arcade/rawmouse/ Raw input] code to implement this idea. An online multiplayer feature has been added to the game as well.

==Development==
The project was first announced during an interview with Healey by LHTimes.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.lionhead.com/news&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In the interview, Healey explained that the game was started after he and a few friends made a £50 kung fu film, and Healey felt a game should go along with it. Healey created a site dedicated to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rag Doll Kung Fu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on the [[Lionhead Studios|Lionhead]] server.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.ragdollkungfu.com&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In late 2005 [[Mark Healey]], David Smith and Alex Evans left [[Lionhead Studios]] to form [[Media Molecule]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rag Doll Kung Fu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was nominated in the 2006 Develop awards for &amp;quot;New PC IP&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Innovation&amp;quot;. It has also been nominated in the [[GameShadow]] Innovation in Games Awards 2006
