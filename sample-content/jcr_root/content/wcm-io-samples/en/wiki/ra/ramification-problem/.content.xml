In [[philosophy]] and [[artificial intelligence]] (especially, knowledge based systems), the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ramification problem&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is concerned with the indirect consequences of an action. It might also be posed as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;how to represent what happens implicitly due to an action&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or how to control the secondary and tertiary effects of an action. It is strongly connected to, and is opposite the [[qualification problem|qualification side]] of, the [[frame problem]].

Limit theory helps in [[operational]] usage. For instance, in [[Knowledge-based engineering|KBE]] derivation of a populated design (geometrical objects, etc., similar concerns apply in shape theory), equivalence assumptions allow convergence where potentially large, and perhaps even computationally indeterminate, solution sets are handled deftly. Yet, in a chain of computation, downstream events may very well find some types of results from earlier resolutions of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ramification&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as problematic for their own algorithms.
