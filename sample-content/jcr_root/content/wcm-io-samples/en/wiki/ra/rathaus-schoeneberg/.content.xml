The [[sandstone]] building was constructed between 1911–1914, when it replaced the old town hall of [[Schöneberg]], at that time an [[independent city]] ({{lang-de|[[Districts of Germany|Stadtkreis]]}}) not yet incorporated into [[Greater Berlin Act|Greater Berlin]], which took place in 1920. The [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] authorities had a series of war murals by [[Franz Eichhorst]] added to the interior in 1938. In [[World War II]] the building was severely damaged by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|Allied bombing]] and during the final [[Battle of Berlin]].

After the war the undestroyed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Neues Stadthaus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, former head office of Berlin&amp;apos;s municipal fire insurance &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Feuersozietät&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, on Parochialstraße in [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]], served as intermittent city hall, replacing the ruined [[Rotes Rathaus]] (Red City Hall, also in East Berlin), the traditional seat of the Berlin government. With the division of Berlin&amp;apos;s city government and administration in September 1948 the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Neues Stadthaus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was in the Communist &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[East Berlin|Ostsektor]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (eastern sector) and became off limits to [[West Berlin]]. As a &amp;quot;temporary&amp;quot; measure the barely repaired Rathaus Schöneberg on Rudolph-Wilde-Platz became the city hall for West Berlin. In 1950 the [[Liberty Bell (Berlin)|Liberty Bell]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Freiheitsglocke&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), a gift by the [[United States]], was installed in the rebuilt tower.

During the [[Berlin Blockade]], the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|Uprising of 1953]] and the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], Rudolph-Wilde-Platz in front of the building became a gathering place for protest rallies. After the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961, the steps of Rathaus Schöneberg were the location where U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] held his famous speech on 26 June 1963, proclaiming &amp;quot;[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]&amp;quot;. On the night of his [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]], several thousands bereaved Berliners spontaneously gathered at the square, which was officially renamed [[John-F.-Kennedy-Platz]] three days later. A large memorial plaque, mounted on a column at the entrance of the building, and the room above the entrance overlooking the square are dedicated to Kennedy and his visit.

After [[German reunification|reunification]], Rathaus Schöneberg reverted to its original purpose of being Schöneberg Borough Town Hall. Upon the 2001 Berlin administrative reform, Rathaus Schöneberg became the town hall for the newly constituted borough of Tempelhof-Schöneberg.

It was also the permanent home to an exhibition of the life of [[Willy Brandt]] (1913–1992), [[List of mayors of Berlin|Mayor of West Berlin]] from 1957 to 1966, [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany]] 1969–1974. The exhibition was closed as from January 2010; it is planned to open again at another site in the city.

Since 2005 the exhibition called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wir waren Nachbarn - Biografien jüdischer Zeitzeugen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (English title:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;We were Neighbours once - Biographies of Jews in Schöneberg and Tempelhof under the Nazi Regime&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) takes place in the exhibition hall of the Rathaus Schöneberg.
