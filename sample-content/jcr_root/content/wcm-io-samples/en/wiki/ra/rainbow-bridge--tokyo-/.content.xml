The {{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rainbow Bridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|レインボーブリッジ|Reinbō burijji}} is a [[suspension bridge]] crossing northern [[Tokyo Bay]] between [[Shibaura]] Pier and the [[Odaiba]] waterfront development in [[Minato, Tokyo]], [[Japan]].

Construction started in 1987 and was completed in 1993. The bridge is {{convert|798|m|ft|0}} long with a main span of {{convert|580|m|ft|0}}.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shutoko.jp/service/spot/rainbowbridge/index.html|title=首都高速道路株式会社｜首都高の名所｜レインボーブリッジ|accessdate=2009-12-26}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Officially called the &amp;quot;[[Shuto Expressway]] [[Route 11 (Shuto Expressway)|No. 11 Daiba Route]] - [[Port of Tokyo]] Connector Bridge,&amp;quot; the name &amp;quot;&amp;apos;Rainbow Bridge&amp;quot; was decided by the public.

The towers supporting the bridge are white in color, designed to harmonize with the skyline of central Tokyo seen from Odaiba. There are lamps placed on the wires supporting the bridge, which are illuminated into three different colors, red, white and green every night using solar energy obtained during the day.

The bridge can be accessed by foot from [[Tamachi Station (Tokyo)|Tamachi Station]] ([[JR East]]) or [[Shibaura-futō Station]] ([[Yurikamome]]) on the mainland side.

==Usage==
The Rainbow Bridge carries three transportation lines on two decks. The upper deck carries the [[Shuto Expressway]]&amp;apos;s [[Route 11 (Shuto Expressway)|Daiba Route]], while the lower deck carries the [[Yurikamome]] [[rapid transit system]] in the centre, walkways on the outer side, and Tokyo Prefectural Route 482 in-between. Route 482 was formerly a tolled road, but opposition to the toll led to its removal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Bicycles and light motorcycles under 50cc are not permitted on either deck or the walkway of the bridge. Motorcycle [[pillion]] passengers are also banned.

===Walkway===
The bridge has two separate walkways on the north and south sides of the lower deck; the north side offers views of the inner Tokyo harbour and [[Tokyo Tower]], while the south side offers views of Tokyo Bay and occasionally [[Mount Fuji]]. The walkways may only be used during certain hours (9 am to 9 pm in the summer; 10 am to 6 pm in the winter).
