&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rally Trophy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a historic PC rally simulation, created by [[Bugbear Entertainment]] and [[JoWood Productions]]. The cars modelled are [[Mini Cooper]] 1275S, [[Saab 96]] V4, [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]] GTA, [[Fiat 600 Abarth]], [[Opel Kadett]], [[Lancia Fulvia]], [[Ford Cortina]], [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] MK1 RS2000, [[Volvo Amazon]], [[Alpine A110]] and [[Lancia Stratos]]. In the game, the player is taken through 42 highly detailed stages in five countries - [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Kenya]] - which cover several road surfaces including [[gravel]], [[mud]] and [[tarmac]]. Stages take place in all weather conditions such as rain in both the day and night. Damage is accurately re-created, even down to broken headlights which the player must of course preserve to see during night stages. Rally Trophy was considered by many people to be the [[Grand Prix Legends]] of rally driving, due to its focus on historic cars, and the physics models of the cars (with no traction control or driver aids) being relatively realistic and challenging for its time.

==Community==
The game has a large community, with many add-ons and utilities available from the sites in the links section below.

In May 2005, No-Grip.net closed, but was revived some time later. Some of the files have been copied to Blackhole Motorsports. In 2007, No-Grip.net moved to nogripracing.com.
