&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rainer Rupp&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1945 in [[Saarlouis]], [[Germany]]) is a former top [[spy]] who worked under the [[codename]]s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mosel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and later &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Topaz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for the East German intelligence service [[Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung|HVA]] (General Reconnaissance Administration) in the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|NATO headquarters]] in [[Brussels]] from 1977 until 1989, releasing [[document]]s of the highest importance (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Cosmic Top Secret]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) to the [[Eastern Bloc]].

==Biography==
Rupp grew up in [[West Germany]] with strong [[left-wing politics|leftist]] [[politics|political]] leanings. In 1968, as a [[student]] in [[Mainz]], [[employment contract|employment]] as a spy for the GDR was suggested to him, and he agreed out of conviction. He continued his studies in [[Brussels]], was trained as a [[spy]] in [[East Berlin]] and was hired by [[NATO]] in 1977. He rose quickly in the ranks and provided [[photograph]]s of some 10,000 pages to his controllers, including the precise location plans for the deployment of [[cruise missile]]s and [[MGM-31 Pershing|Pershing II]] missiles in [[Western Europe]], as well as the central [[MC 161]] document which summarized the NATO strategy as well as NATO&amp;apos;s analysis of the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its intentions. These documents were promptly transferred to the [[KGB]].

He would photograph documents in his office, or take them home and photograph them in his [[wine cellar]]. He met contact persons all over [[Europe]] and received instructions via [[number station]]s, [[radio]] programs [[broadcasting]] messages [[encryption|encrypted]] as [[number sequence]]s. His [[United Kingdom|British]] wife knew about his activities and tried to persuade him to stop. He later said &amp;quot;At the time I did it, I believed it to be my [[moral duty]].&amp;quot;{{cn|date=September 2012}}

NATO did not have any knowledge of the existence of Topaz until GDR officer [[Heinz Busch]] [[defection|defected]] in 1990. Busch however did not know the identity of Topas. Several meetings of the [[secret service]]s of a number of countries ensued with the aim of identifying Topaz, who took part in some of those meetings. With the help of the [[Rosenholz files]] that had fallen into the hands of the [[CIA]] after the dissolution of the GDR, Rupp was caught in 1993, while on vacation in Germany. He confessed and received a [[prison sentence]] of 12 years in 1994. He was released early in July 2000. Rupp became a member of the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|PDS]] and served temporarily as an advisor in regard to issues of security and [[foreign policy]]; he quit the party, however, in 2003.&amp;lt;ref name=spiegel&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/2466/der_heisse_draht_zum_nato_rat.html |author=Norbert F. Pötzl |title=Der heisse Draht zum Nato-Rat|publisher=Der Spiegel (German)|date=2008-07-31}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Averted atomic war claim==
Rupp claims that his activities may have averted a [[nuclear war]] in the fall of 1983, a claim that is not entirely unfounded according to American experts.&amp;lt;ref name=spiegel/&amp;gt; In an interview for the Channel 4 programme &amp;quot;1983: The Brink of Apocalypse&amp;quot;, about exercise [[Able Archer 83]], broadcast in the UK on 5 January 2008, he said that he had transmitted the message that NATO was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;not&amp;apos;&amp;apos; preparing to launch a surprise nuclear attack against the USSR during the exercise to his HVA controllers. He did this by way of encoding the message on a device disguised as a calculator which then turned the message into a short electronic burst which could be transmitted to a set telephone number. He viewed this as vital to preventing a Soviet pre-emptive strike against NATO forces. In the same program, Rupp said he was proud of the damage he did to NATO over the years of his intelligence activities.
