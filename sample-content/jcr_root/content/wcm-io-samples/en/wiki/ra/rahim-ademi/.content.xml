&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rahim Ademi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born January 30, 1954) is a [[Croatia]]n Army [[general]] of [[Kosovo]]-[[Albanians|Albanian]] origin.

Born and raised in the village of Karač, [[Vučitrn]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]], now found in [[Kosovo]]. Ademi finished the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] military academy in Belgrade in 1976. He was assigned to a station in [[Rogoznica]] near [[Šibenik]] in Croatia where he married and had two children.

In 1986, the Military Court in [[Sarajevo]] convicted him of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;counterrevolutionary acts&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Albanian [[irredentism]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but after serving a year and a half in prison, the Supreme Military Court agreed with his appeal and acquitted him. He would spend the next years serving as an officer in [[Sinj]] until 1990 when the war in Croatia was starting and he deserted the [[Yugoslav People&amp;apos;s Army]] in order to help create Croatian army formations in that part of the country.

He officially joined the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in 1991 and later became part of the [[Military of Croatia|Croatian Army forces]] during the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. Between 1992 and 1993, as a [[Brigadier]], he commanded Croatian military units in the Sinj area, with particular responsibility for the [[Peruća|Peruća Dam]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Personal recollection as UN Military Observer Jul 1992 - Feb 1993. (Commando1664)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 1993 he was assigned to the post of sub commander of the [[Gospić]] military district, but was relieved of duty later that year, after the infamous [[Medak pocket]] operation.

Ademi later served as a sub commander of the [[Split (city)|Split]] military district and was promoted to [[brigadier general]] for his achievements in [[Operation Storm]] in 1995. He remained there until 1999 when he was reassigned to the post of the Assistant Chief Inspector of the Armed Forces in [[Zagreb]].

In 2001 the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] indicted Ademi for alleged crimes against humanity committed against the Croatian [[Serbs]] in the aforementioned [[Medak pocket]] operation. He was in the custody of the Court but was later allowed to prepare his defense free. In November 2005, in line with its completion strategy, the ICTY referred the Ademi-Norac case to the Croatian judiciary. The trial began on 18 June 2007 in front of a special bench of the Zagreb County Court with Judge Marin Mrčela presiding.

Ademi claims that the Croatian government, under international pressure, relieved him of duty in [[Gospić]] in 1993 in order to make him a scapegoat, rather than implicating commanding officers [[Janko Bobetko]],&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ICTY - Tribunal Update&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; [[Mirko Norac]] and [[Mladen Markač]]. He also alleges that the Tribunal wanted him for questioning as far back as 1998 but that the government did not allow him to answer their questions. He is convinced that he is being sacrificed because of his [[Albanians|Albanian]] descent.

On 30 May 2008, he was acquitted by the Zagreb County Court of responsibility for atrocities committed against [[Serb]] prisoners by Croat troops during [[Operation Medak Pocket]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ICTY - Tribunal Update&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.iwpr.net/?p=tri&amp;amp;s=f&amp;amp;o=344881&amp;amp;apc_state=henh Ademi Acquitted of Medak Pocket Crimes]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In March 2010, the [[Supreme Court of Croatia]] upheld Ademi&amp;apos;s acquittal.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/croatia-urged-speed-war-crimes-prosecutions-2010-12-09 | title = Croatia urged to speed up war crimes prosecutions | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | date = 2010-12-09 | accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
