The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Taz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Таз}}) is a river located in western [[Siberia]], has a length of {{convert|1401|km|sp=us}} and drains a basin estimated at {{convert|150000|km2|sp=us}}.

The Taz River flows into the [[Taz Estuary|Tazovskaya Guba]], a roughly {{convert|250|km|sp=us|adj=on}} long estuary that begins in the area of the settlement of [[Tazovsky (rural locality)|Tazovsky]] and ends in the [[Gulf of Ob]]. A [[portage]] connects the Taz with the [[Turukhan River|Turukhan]] and the [[Yenisei River]]s. Its major [[tributary|tributaries]] include the [[Bolshaya Shirta River|Bolshaya Shirta]] and [[Khudosey River]]s from the right and the [[Tolka River (Russia)|Tolka]] and [[Chaselka River]]s from the left.
