&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;TAT-6&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the sixth [[transatlantic telephone cable]]. It was in operation from 1976 to 1994, initially carrying 4,800 telephone circuits (simultaneous calls) between Green Hill, [[Rhode Island]] and  [[Saint-Hilaire-de-Riez]], [[France]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=1990 World&amp;apos;s Submarine Telephone Cable Systems |publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce |year=1990}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Known as the SG coaxial cable system, designed by [[Bell Labs]], the cable is {{Convert|3396|nmi|km|-2}} with repeater spacing of {{Convert|5.1|nmi|km|0}}.
The deep sea portion, some {{Convert|3000|nmi|km|-2}} in length, was laid by the Cable Ship LONG LINES, owned by AT&amp;amp;T. Portions of the shore sections were laid by the French Cable Ship &amp;apos;Vercors&amp;apos;.

Although the majority of the system was designed by Bell Labs, portions were designed and built by the French and British, such as the terminal equipment and the power plant.
The US cable station was located at Green Hill, RI, while the French cable terminal at St. Hilaire, France.

A few years later, TAT-7 was put into service between [[Tuckerton, New Jersey]] and Lands End, England, and was the last analog Transatlantic undersea system.

The following system, TAT-8, was implemented by [[AT&amp;amp;T]] (with [[Bell Laboratories]]), [[Standard Telephones and Cables|STC]] (with [[BT Group|British Telecom]]), and [[Alcatel]] (with France Telecom). This was the first Transatlantic Fiber-Optic system, had greatly increased capacity and performance.
