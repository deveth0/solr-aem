        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tamworth Manifesto&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a political [[manifesto]] issued by Sir [[Robert Peel]] in 1834 in [[Tamworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Tamworth]], which is widely credited by historians as having laid down the principles upon which the modern British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] is based.

In November 1834, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] removed the [[Whig (UK)|Whig]] Prime Minister [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] and asked the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] to form a ministry. Wellington was reluctant and recommended that the King choose Peel.

Perhaps owing to Wellington&amp;apos;s endorsement, Peel intended from the start, as the historian S.J Lee tells, &amp;quot;to fully convince the country and electorate that there was a substantial difference between his brand of conservatism and that of his predecessor and &amp;apos;old tory&amp;apos; Wellington.&amp;quot;

With that in mind, on 18 December, the Tamworth Manifesto was published by the press and read around the country. Like many other manifestos in nineteenth-century British politics, it was formally an address to the electors of the leader&amp;apos;s own constituency, but reproduced widely. Ironically, [[Tamworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Tamworth]] had no contest in 1834 as Peel was the only candidate and he was elected unopposed.

== Peel&amp;apos;s Aims dictated in the Tamworth Manifesto==

The main aim of the manifesto was to appeal to the electorate in the new Parliament.

* Peel accepted that the [[Reform Act 1832]] was &amp;quot;a final and irrevocable settlement of a great constitutional question&amp;quot;.
* He promised that the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] would undertake a &amp;quot;careful review of institutions, civil and ecclesiastical&amp;quot;.
* Where there was a case for change, he promised &amp;quot;the correction of proved abuses and the redress of real grievances&amp;quot;.
* Peel offered to look at the question of church reform in order to preserve the &amp;quot;true interests of the Established religion&amp;quot;.
* Peel&amp;apos;s basic message, therefore, was that the Conservatives &amp;quot;would reform to survive&amp;quot; (with reference to Norman Gash&amp;apos;s biography of Peel).
* However, he opposed what he saw as unnecessary change, fearing &amp;quot;a perpetual vortex of agitation&amp;quot;
