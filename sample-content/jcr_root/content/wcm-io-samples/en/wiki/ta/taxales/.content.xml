        text="&lt;p&gt;The [[plant]] order &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Taxales&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was until recently treated as a distinct order in the division [[Pinophyta]], class Pinopsida, and included only those species in the family [[Taxaceae]], known commonly as yews. Under this interpretation, all other [[conifer]]s were classified separately in the order &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pinales]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Recent genetic and [[wikt:micromorphological|micromorphological]] studies, however, have shown the Taxaceae are closely related to the other conifers, particularly so to the family [[Cephalotaxaceae]]. The order Taxales is therefore no longer recognised as distinct, and the family [[Taxaceae]] is now included in the order Pinales. See [[Pinophyta]] for more details.
