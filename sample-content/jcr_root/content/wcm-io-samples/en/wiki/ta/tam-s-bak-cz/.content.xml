[[File:Bakócz.jpg|thumb|Tamás Bakócz (memorial coin)]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tamás Bakócz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1442 [[Ardud|Erdőd]] –  15 June 1521, [[Esztergom]]) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] archbishop, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] and statesman.

In sources in Croatian, Tamás Bakócz is also referred under the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Toma Bakač&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{hr icon}} [http://povijest.net/sadrzaj/teme/putopisi/147-ostrogon.html Povijest.net] Ostrogon (Esztergom) – kraljevska prijestolnica na Dunavu&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He was the son of a wagoner and was adopted by his uncle, who trained him for the priesthood and whom he succeeded as rector of [[Tetel|Tétel]] (1480). He studied in [[Breslau]] and [[Padua]]. Shortly afterwards he became one of the secretaries of [[King of Hungary|King]] [[Matthias Corvinus]], who made him bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Győr|Győr]] and a member of the royal council (1490). Under [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary]] (1490&amp;amp;ndash;1516) he became successively bishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Eger|Eger]], the richest of the Hungarian sees, archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Esztergom-Budapest|Esztergom]] (1497), cardinal (1500), and titular [[Latin Patriarch of Constantinople]] (1510).

From 1490 to his death in 1521 he was the leading statesman of Hungary and mainly responsible for foreign policy. It was solely through his efforts that Hungary did not accede to the [[War of the League of Cambrai|league of Cambrai]], was consistently friendly with [[Venice]], and formed a family compact with the [[Habsburgs]]. He was also the only [[Magyars|Magyar]] prelate who seriously aspired to the papal throne. In 1513, on the death of [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]], he went to [[Rome]] for the express purpose of bringing about his own election as pope. He was received with more than princely pomp, and all but succeeded in his design, thanks to his extraordinary adroitness and the command of an almost unlimited bribing-fund. But Venice and the emperor played him false, and he failed.

He returned to [[Hungary]] as papal [[Papal legate|legate]], bringing with him the [[Papal bull|bull]] of [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] proclaiming a fresh [[crusade]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. But the crusade degenerated into a [[jacquerie]] which ravaged the whole kingdom, and much discredited Bakócz. He lost some of his influence at first after the death of Wladislaus, but continued to be the guiding spirit at court, till age and infirmity confined him almost entirely to his house in the last three years of his life. He left a fortune of many millions.

He and his family are buried in a separate chapel of the [[Esztergom Basilica]], the most precious artwork of the Hungarian Renaissance.
