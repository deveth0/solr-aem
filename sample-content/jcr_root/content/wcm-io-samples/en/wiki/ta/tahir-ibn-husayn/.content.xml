        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tahir ibn Husayn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Arabic: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;طاهر بن حسين&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (died 822) was a  general and governor during the [[Abbasid]] [[caliphate]].  Specifically, he served under [[al-Ma&amp;apos;mun]] during the [[Fourth Fitna]] and led the armies that would defeat [[al-Amin]], making al-Ma&amp;apos;mun the caliph.  He was born in Phoshang which is a village in ancient city of  [[Herat]] (then [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] present day [[Afghanistan]]).

Afterwards, Tahir was made governor of the eastern [[Abbasid]] lands, effectively making him governor of [[Abbasid|Persia]].  Tahir later declared independence from the Abbasid empire in 822 by omitting any mention of al-Ma&amp;apos;mun during a Friday sermon.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  However, he died the same night and al-Ma&amp;apos;mun appointed Tahir&amp;apos;s son to continue at his father&amp;apos;s post. This established the [[Tahirid dynasty]], which ruled a semi-autonomous state in eastern Persia.

Tahir commissioned the Christian theologian, [[Theodore Abu-Qurrah]] (died c. 830) to translate the pseudo-Aristotelian [[De virtutibus animae]] into Arabic.
