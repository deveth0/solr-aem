&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Uusimaa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Swedish: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nyland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), is a [[Historical provinces of Finland|historical province]] in the south of [[Finland]]. It borders to [[Finland Proper (historical province)|Finland Proper]], [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]], [[Savonia (historical province)|Savonia]], and [[Finnish Karelia|Karelia]]. The English translation would be &amp;quot;new land&amp;quot;. From the Middle Ages to 1809, most of the present-day Finland was a part of Kingdom of Sweden. Uusimaa (Nyland) was thus included also among the historical Swedish provinces.

==History==
Along with the rest of Southern and Western Finland, Uusimaa was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Sweden]] from the 12th or 13th century onwards. Coastal Uusimaa had earlier been semi-deserted, but was soon populated by Swedish settlers.

All the provinces of Finland were ceded to [[Imperial Russia]] after the [[War of Finland]] in 1809.  Uusimaa became [[Uudenmaan l채채ni]] in the old [[l채채ni]] (province) system until 1997, when it  was merged into the new administrative province of [[Southern Finland]]. In 2010 the administrative provinces were abolished and Uusima was divided between two new [[regions of Finland]], [[Uusimaa (region)|Uusimaa]] and [[Eastern Uusimaa]]. However, this arrangement lasted for only one year, and in 2011 Eastern Uusimaa was merged into Uusimaa, which now forms a single administrative unit once again.

Historically, coastal Uusimaa was a Swedish-speaking area. However, the capital of Finland, [[Helsinki]], and most of the other towns in Uusimaa now have Finnish-speaking majorities.

The arms of Uusimaa were granted at the burial of [[Gustav I of Sweden]] in 1560. The arms are crowned by a count&amp;apos;s coronet, though by Finnish tradition this more resembles a Swedish baronal coronet. Blazon: &amp;quot;Azure, between two bars wavy argent, a boat with rudder, or.&amp;quot;
