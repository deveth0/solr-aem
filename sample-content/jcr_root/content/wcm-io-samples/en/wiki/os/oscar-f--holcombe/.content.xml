[[File:Oscar Holcombe.jpeg|thumb|180px|Oscar Holcombe speaking from a podium]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oscar Fitzallen Holcombe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (December 31, 1888&amp;amp;ndash;June 18, 1968) served as the [[mayor]] of [[Houston, Texas]] for 22 years, in 11 non-consecutive terms.

Holcombe was born in [[Mobile, Alabama]] and raised in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. He moved to Houston when he was 18, and founded his own construction business, the O. F. Holcombe Company, at age 26. His business acumen and contacts eventually made Holcombe a millionaire.

Six years after founding his business, in 1921, Holcombe won his first term as mayor. He would serve as mayor from 1921 to 1929, 1933 to 1937, 1939 to 1941, 1947 to 1953, and 1956 to 1958. His administrations were considered to be conservative and pro-business, though Holcombe was also aggressive about expanding the city&amp;apos;s boundaries and improving public services (such as libraries, a municipal auditorium, and an improved sewage system).

Holcombe married Mary Grey Miller on May 3, 1912. They had one daughter, Elisabeth, who married Henry Markley Crosswell, Jr.

==Honors==
During the early 1960s, Houston renamed the stretch of [[Bellaire Boulevard]] east of [[Southside Place]], which runs through the [[Texas Medical Center]], as Holcombe Boulevard. In the late 1980s, the municipality of [[West University Place]] also renamed Bellaire Boulevard as Holcombe Boulevard within its jurisdiction.
