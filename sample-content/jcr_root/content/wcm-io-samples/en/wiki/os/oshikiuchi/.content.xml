}}{{Nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oshikiuchi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|御式内|o-shikiuchi}} is a term referring to some sort of techniques for use in formal circumstances. The term itself translates literally to something like &amp;quot;honorable manner for indoors&amp;quot;. Scholars dispute whether oshikiuchi is literally a set of manners or etiquette for use on formal occasions, or a set of martial arts techniques specialized for use in formal situations where the wearing of weapons is restricted, such as the palace of one&amp;apos;s lord. [[Takeda Sōkaku]], the modern founder of [[Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu]], claimed that it was a secret martial art passed down through members of his family in the [[Aizu]] domain, and that he combined in some way with his family&amp;apos;s martial arts, which he eventually taught publicly as Daitō-ryū.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite encyclopedia
