&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Osvaldo Cavandoli&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (January 1, 1920 â€“ March 3, 2007), also known by his [[pen name]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cava&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was an Italian [[cartoonist]]. His most famous work is his series of short animated cartoons, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[La Linea (TV series)|La Linea]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;The Line&amp;quot;).

Cavandoli was born in [[Toscolano-Maderno|Maderno sul Garda]], Italy, but moved to [[Milan]] when he was two years old (later becoming an honorary citizen of that city). From 1936 to 1940 he worked as a technical designer for [[Alfa Romeo]]. When he developed his interest in cartoons in 1943, he started working with Nino Pagot, who later created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Calimero]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 1950 he started working independently as a director and a producer.

==La Linea (The Line)==

Cavandoli enjoyed worldwide recognition in 1969 with his character &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[La Linea (TV series)|La Linea]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a simply drawn cartoon born and lived out of a single white pencil stroke. Cavandoli initially proposed his work for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Carosello]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, an Italian advertisement break broadcast between 1957 and 1977.  Massimo Lagostina, the owner of a popular brand of cookware, chose it as a testimonial for his advertising campaign. Following the success of the commercial, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;La Linea&amp;apos;&amp;apos; became the protagonist of an animated series subsequently adopted in many European countries,
