&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ossès&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Lang-eu|Ortzaize}}) is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]] [[Departments of France|department]] in south-western [[France]].

It lies in the traditional [[Northern Basque Country|Basque]] [[provinces of France|province]] of [[Lower Navarre]].

==Geography==
Ossès is located {{Convert|13|km|mi|0}} north-west of [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port]], in the [[foothills]] of the [[Pyrenees]]. It is surrounded by low hills in the Ossès valley, a part of the [[valley]] of the [[river]] [[Nive]], home of the [[pottok]], the wild Basque [[horse]]. The surrounding countryside is considered very beautiful, with several trails, long-distance walks and [[picnic]] sites. The air was described as coming &amp;apos;straight from [[heaven]]&amp;apos; by a local [[poet]].

==History==
The [[village]] was under the [[authority]] of the [[Dukes of Gascogne]], then [[Duke of Aquitaine|of Aquitaine]], but was passed to the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] with the [[marriage]] of Princess [[Berengaria of Navarre]], [[daughter]] of [[King]] [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho the Wise]], to [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] in 1191.

Ossès had the status of a [[Cantons of France|canton]] but lost this after the [[French Revolution]].

The [[graveyard]] has a small number of stone Basque [[cross]]es. There are several traditional Basque houses around the square, characterised by their [[pink]] [[sandstone]] [[lintel]]s and half-timbers, including the 1628 Maison Sastriarena, where the [[Bishop]]s of [[Bayonne]] were [[entertainment|entertained]], and the Maison Harizmendi, where the prelate who married [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]] stayed in 1660 on his way to the wedding party. The old [[laundry]] building has also been preserved.
