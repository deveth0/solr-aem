The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oslo Stock Exchange&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-no|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oslo Børs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}) ({{ose|OSLO}}) serves as the main market for trading in the shares of Norwegian [[company (law)|companies]].  It opens at 9:00am and closes 4:30pm local time ([[Central European Time|CET]]).  In additional to a wide range of domestic companies, the OSE attracts a lot of international companies within [[petroleum]], [[shipping]] and other related areas.

The exchange has pre-market sessions from 08:15am to 09:00am, normal trading sessions from 09:00am to 04:20pm and post-market sessions from 04:20pm to 04:30pm on all days of the week except Saturdays, Sundays and holidays declared by the Exchange in advance.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Wikinvest:List of Stock Exchanges|Market Hours, Oslo Stock Exchange via Wikinvest]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
The Oslo Stock Exchange started life as [[Kristiania|Christiania]] Børs in 1819.  In the beginning, there was no organized listing or [[stock exchange]]; the Børs served as a meeting place for investors auctioning ships, shares in ships, commodities, and foreign currencies.  Stocks and bonds only started trading on the exchange in 1881.

In 1988, the exchange introduced an electronic trading support system, and replaced the old auction model with continuous trading of listed shares throughout the day.  Trading became fully electronic in 1999 and the trading floor was discontinued.

==OBX Index==
{{main|OBX Index}}
The OBX Index is a list of the 25 most [[Market liquidity|liquid]] companies on the Oslo Stock Exchange main index.  The companies have their own index common OBX index.  All stocks on the OBX list can be traded with [[option (finance)|options]] and [[Futures contract|futures]] which are listed on the [[Sola Trading|SOLA]] derivative platform.  The companies on the OBX list are rotated twice a year, on the third Friday of June and December.

==Ownership==
The Oslo Stock Exchange remained a self-owning institution until 2001 when it converted into a [[joint stock company]] and offered shares to the public in an [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]]. [[DNB ASA]] owns 20% of the Holding company Oslo Børs Vps Holding ASA, with most of the rest of the stock owned by foreign and domestic investors.
