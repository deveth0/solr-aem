&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Osvaldo Vieira International Airport&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{Airport codes|OXB|GGOV}} is an [[airport]] that serves the city of [[Bissau]], the capital city of [[Guinea-Bissau]]. It is the only international airport in the country.

Previously known as Bissalanca, during the [[Guinea-Bissau_War_of_Independence]] it was used as a base by the [[Portuguese Air Force]].

Osvaldo Vieira International Airport has one [[runway]], heading 03/21, with a length of 10,498 feet (3200 m). The altitude of this runway is 127 feet (39 m). This runway is also one of the three in Guinea-Bissau that are paved.  There is currently only one intercontinental route, flown by TAP Portugal three times a week to Lisbon, Portugal.  Senegal Airlines has daily flights to Dakar, while TACV flies twice a week to Praia via Dakar.  In December 2011, Royal Air Maroc began a twice weekly service from Casablanca.

The airport had to be closed on June 7, 1998 due to intense fighting in and around Bissau. It was officially reopened in July 1999 when a [[TAP Portugal]] plane carrying Prime Minister [[Francisco Fadul]], along with numerous other dignitaries from both [[Portugal]] and Guinea-Bissau, landed at Osvaldo Vieira. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}
