&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Urban America Television&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;UATV&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was an over-the-air [[television]] broadcast network in the [[United States]]. According to the company&amp;apos;s website, the network had 70 [[affiliate]] stations. UATV had a reach of 22 million households in the United States. It was a successor to the earlier [[American Independent Television]] network and began broadcasting December 3, 2001 at 8am (CST). Created and developed by Fred Hutton (among others) the early programming featured independent produced programs and old 30&amp;apos;s and 40&amp;apos;s black and white &amp;quot;race movies&amp;quot;.

The company was the only minority-certified television network with the National Minority Supplier Development Council.

==Programming==
Urban America TV&amp;apos;s programming was mainly geared toward the 80 million urban consumers that consist of English-speaking Hispanic, African-American, Asian and other ethnic minorites. The network aired both original programs and, during many hours of the day, old movies.  The company also syndicated programs to stations beyond its network reach.

==May 1, 2006: UATV Ceases Operations==
According to its filings with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]], Urban America Television &amp;quot;is experiencing liquidity needs&amp;quot;, which severely hampered its ability to continue operations. In addition, &amp;quot;[d]ue to the lack of necessary capital resources, the Company is not able to pay for its satellite space and uplinking services,&amp;quot; which stopped affiliates from airing UATV programming. Also, UATV &amp;quot;has laid-off its master control employees while it seek financing.&amp;quot; [http://sec.freeedgar.com/displayText.asp?ID=4491198]

As a result of this, on May 1, 2006, Urban America Television suspended operations indefinitely, while it attempted to raise enough capital to continue operations. In the words of the company, &amp;quot;[i]f adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms our business future as a viable entity is in severe jeopardy.&amp;quot;  This statement proved to be prophetic, as adequate funding never came and the network never resumed broadcast operation.

In response to this action, many affiliates were forced to find alternative sources of programming. Competing networks such as [[America One]] and [[3ABN]] benefited from the failure of UATV, and stations such as [[WUHQ-LD]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] and [[WVTT-CA|WONS-LP]] in [[Olean, New York]], simply swapped affiliations.
