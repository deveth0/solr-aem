&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Urgench&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-uz|Urganch/Урганч}}; {{lang-fa|گرگانج / Gorganch}}) is a city (1999 pop. 139,100) in western [[Uzbekistan]]. It is the capital of the [[Khorezm Province]], on the [[Amu Darya]] River and the Shavat canal. The city is situated 450 km west of [[Bukhara]] across the [[Kyzyl Kum]] Desert. It is located at latitude 41° 32&amp;apos; 60N longitude 60° 37&amp;apos; 60E, at an altitude of 91 meters.

The history of the city goes back to the second half of the 18th century. The city should not be confused with the like-named city of [[Konya-Urgench]] (also known as &amp;quot;Old Urgench&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Gurgench&amp;quot;) in [[Turkmenistan]]. The city of Old Urgench was relocated to Urgench after the Amu Darya river changed its course in the 16th century, leaving the old town high and dry and without water.  New Urgench was a trade center of the [[Khanate of Khiva]].

Modern Urgench is a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style city with  [[cotton]] motifs adorning many objects, from street lights to apartment houses. Of note is a monument to the twenty [[Komsomol]] members killed by Tekke [[Basmachi Revolt|basmachi]] on the banks of the [[Syr Darya]] in 1922, and a large statue to Muhammed [[al-Khwarizmi]], the 9th century local [[mathematician]] who revolutionised [[algebra]], outside the Hotel Urgench. A flat, dry place, this hotel is the main gateway for tourists to [[Khiva]] 35 kilometres to the southeast, whose old city, known as [[Itchan Kala]], is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].
