[[File:COA Urien Glodrydd.svg|right|thumb|Arms attributed to Urien in the Middle Ages featuring the [[raven]]]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Urien&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|jʊər|i|ɛ|n}}, often referred to as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Urien Rheged&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was a late 6th-century king of [[Rheged]], an early [[Britons (historic)|British]] kingdom of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hen Ogledd]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (northern [[England]] and southern [[Scotland]]). His power and his victories, including the battles of [[Battle of Gwen Ystrad|Gwen Ystrad]] and [[Battle of Alclud Ford|Alt Clut Ford]], are celebrated in the praise poems to him by [[Taliesin]], preserved in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Book of Taliesin]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He had four sons, named Owain, Rhiwallon, Rhun and Pasgen, the eldest of whom succeeded him. He became the &amp;quot;King Urien of Gore&amp;quot; of later [[Arthurian]] legend and his son [[Owain mab Urien]] was later known as [[Ywain]].

According to the genealogies, Urien was the son of [[Cynfarch Oer]], son of [[Meirchion Gul]], son of Gorwst, son of Cenau, son of [[Coel Hen]] ([[King Cole]]), the first recorded post-Roman military leader in the area of [[Hadrian&amp;apos;s Wall]]. He fought against the rulers of the [[Angles|Anglian]] kingdom of [[Bernicia]] (modern Northumbria). An Anglian noble, Ida, had occupied [[Lindisfarne|Metcauld]] around the middle of the 6th century and begun to raid the mainland. Urien joined with other northern kings, [[Rhydderch Hael]] &amp;quot;the Generous&amp;quot; of [[Strathclyde]] and two other descendants of Coel, Gwallog mab Llaenog and [[Morcant Bulc|Morgant Bwlch]]. They defeated the Angles and besieged them on Lindisfarne but, according to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Historia Brittonum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Urien was assassinated at the behest of Morgant Bwlch, who was jealous of his power. One of the [[Welsh Triads]] calls the death of Urien one of the &amp;quot;Three Unfortunate Assassinations&amp;quot; and another lists him as one of the &amp;quot;Three Great Battle-leaders of Britain&amp;quot;.

==Legend==
Urien remained a popular figure in [[Wales]] over the centuries, and he and his son Owain were incorporated into [[Arthurian legend]] as it spread from Britain to continental Europe. His kingdom was eventually transferred to the mythical land of Gore, and Kings [[Lot (Arthurian legend)|Lot of Lothian]] and Auguselus of Scotland are sometimes said to be his brothers. During the reign of [[Uther Pendragon]] he marries Arthur&amp;apos;s sister (often [[Morgan le Fay]], but sometimes another sister is named). He, like the kings of several other lands, initially opposes [[King Arthur|Arthur]]&amp;apos;s accession to the throne after Uther&amp;apos;s death. Urien and the others rebel against the young monarch, but upon their defeat, the rebels become Arthur&amp;apos;s allies and vassals.

In the legends his marriage to Morgan is not portrayed as a happy one, however, as in one story Morgan plots to take [[Excalibur]], kill Urien and Arthur, and place herself and her lover [[Accolon]] on the throne. He is always said to be the father of [[Ywain]] (Owain), and many texts give him a second son, [[Ywain the Bastard]], fathered on his seneschal&amp;apos;s wife. Welsh tradition attributes to him a daughter named [[Morfydd]].

[[Thomas Malory]] sometimes spells his name &amp;quot;Urience&amp;quot;, which has led some (e.g. [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]]) to identify him with King [[Rience]].

Urien is mentioned in the 20th century Welsh [[awdl]] [[Yr Arwr]] by [[Hedd Wyn]]. He is also one of the key characters in [[Melvyn Bragg]]&amp;apos;s novel &amp;apos;[[Credo (novel)|Credo]]&amp;apos; (1996), a celebration of the Celtic tradition and its fight against the Northumbrian and Roman (Catholic) incursions.
