&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Urianus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a legendary king of the [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] as accounted by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]].  He was the son of King [[Andragius]] and was succeeded by [[Eliud]]. Geoffrey may possibly have based the character on that of [[Urien Rheged]] (6th century), although there is no resemblance between them.
