        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ur-Hamlet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the German prefix &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[wikt:ur-|Ur-]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; means &amp;quot;primordial&amp;quot;) is the name given to a play of [[Anonymous work|unknown authorship]] mentioned as early as 1589, a decade before most scholars believe [[Shakespeare]] composed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hamlet]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but also involving the character of [[Hamlet (character)|Hamlet]]. Several surviving references indicate that such a play was well known throughout the decade of the 1590s, some time before the first published texts of Shakespeare&amp;apos;s play (1603, 1604).

The earliest such reference occurs in 1589 when [[Thomas Nashe]] in his introduction to [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Menaphon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; implies the existence of an early &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hamlet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:

:English [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] read by candle-light yields many good sentences, as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Blood is a begger&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and so forth; and if you entreat him fair in a frosty morning, he will afford you whole Hamlets, I should say handfuls of tragical speeches.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Nashe quoted in Jenkins, p.83&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

A 1594 performance record of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hamlet&amp;apos;&amp;apos; appears in [[Philip Henslowe]]&amp;apos;s diary and in 1596 [[Thomas Lodge]] wrote of &amp;quot;the ghost which cried so miserably at the theatre, like an oyster-wife, Hamlet, revenge!&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Jenkins, p.83&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Because Nashe apparently alludes to [[Thomas Kyd]] in the same passage, and because of similarities between the Shakespearean &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hamlet]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and Kyd&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Spanish Tragedy]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, it has sometimes been posited that Kyd is the author of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ur-Hamlet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Jenkins, p.83-4&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and that the play was never published and is now lost.

Other scholars believe that the play is an early version of Shakespeare&amp;apos;s own play, and point to the fact that Shakespeare&amp;apos;s version survives in three quite different early texts, [[Hamlet Q1|Q1]] (1603), Q2 (1604) and F (1623), suggesting the possibility that it was revised by the author over a period of many years. While the exact relationship of the short and apparently primitive text of Q1 to the later published texts is not resolved, [[Hardin Craig]] among others has suggested that it may represent an earlier draft of the play and hence would confirm that the &amp;quot;Ur-Hamlet&amp;quot; is in fact merely an earlier draft of Shakespeare&amp;apos;s play. The mainstream view is that Q1 is simply a garbled unauthorised version of the text, which would explain the quick publication of the corrected version, Q2.

This view is held in some form or another by [[Harold Bloom]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Bloom, pp. xiii, 383&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Peter Alexander (academic)|Peter Alexander]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Alexander, Peter vol.4 of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Heritage of Shakespeare: Tragedies&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p. 638&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and [[Andrew Cairncross]], who stated that &amp;quot;It may be assumed, until a new case can be shown to the contrary, that Shakespeare&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hamlet&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and no other is the play mentioned by Nashe in 1589 and Henslowe in 1594.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Cairncross|first=Andrew Scott|title=&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Problem of Hamlet: A Solution&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|year=1936|oclc=301819}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Harold Jenkins, in his 1982 Arden edition, dismisses this assertion.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Jenkins, p. 84, note 4&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
