==Impact and style==
The creative visual input and influence of advertising and [[Fashion photography|fashion photographer]] Jorge Parra, who produced and photographed all editorial content for the first five editions of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Urbe Bikini&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, has helped creating this editorial success, an opened the opportunities to a new breed of young photographers in Venezuela.

More recently, the magazine has gone more towards [[boudoir]]-[[soft porn]] kind of imagery, which has led to still higher record sales for editorial publications in Venezuela.
