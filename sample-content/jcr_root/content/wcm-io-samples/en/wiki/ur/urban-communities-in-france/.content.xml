{{Administrative divisions of France}}
In France, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;urban communities&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-fr|link=no|communauté urbaine}}) are the most integrated form of [[commune in France#Intercommunality|intercommunality]] in France. An urban community is composed of a city ([[communes in France|commune]]) and its independent suburbs (independent communes).

The first urban communities were created by the French Parliament on 31 December 1966. Originally there were only four, found in the metropolitan areas of [[Bordeaux]], [[Lille]], [[Lyon]] and [[Strasbourg]]. Later, others were created in other metropolitan areas. The purpose of the urban communities was to achieve cooperation and joint administration between large cities and their independent suburbs. This step often followed failed attempts to merge the communes within a metropolitan area. The status of the urban communities was modified by the [[Jean-Pierre Chevènement|Chevènement]] Law of 1999.

Unlike [[Agglomeration communities in France|agglomeration communities]] and [[Communauté de communes|commune communities]], communes cannot leave an urban community freely.

As of 1 January 2009, there are 16 urban communities in France (all in [[metropolitan France]]), with a combined population of 7.47 million inhabitants (as of Jan. 2006 census, in 2009 limits).&amp;lt;ref name=DGCL&amp;gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web| url=http://manage.dgcl.interieur.gouv.fr/workspaces/members/desl/documents/intercommunalite/liste_composition_ep/2009/epci2009_new/downloadFile/file/epci2009.txt| title=Base des EPCI à fiscalité propre| first=Ministry of the Interior| last=Direction générale des collectivités locales (DGCL)| format=PDF|accessdate=2009-03-24| authorlink=Minister of the Interior (France)}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; All of the urban areas in France with more than half a million inhabitants are urban communities, except for Paris. The [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]], which is one of the [[regions of France]], effectively provides a combined administrative unit covering the Paris urban area. Some urban communities are relatively small; smaller than many [[Agglomeration communities in France|agglomeration communities]].

The Urban communities are administrated by a council called &amp;quot;conseil communautaire&amp;quot; (council of community), composed by a proportional representation of members of municipal councils of member towns. The council is headed by an executive composed by a president and vice-presidents elected by the council. The president may be in often cases the mayor of the main city, or the most populated city. The mayors of the others cities are often also vice-presidents of the executive, the deputies-mayors are often members of the council, also composed by members of the towns councils.
