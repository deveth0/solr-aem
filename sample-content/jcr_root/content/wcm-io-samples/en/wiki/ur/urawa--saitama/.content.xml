{{Nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Urawa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|浦和市|Urawa-shi}} was a city in [[Saitama Prefecture]], [[Japan]], until it merged into the city of [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama]] together with two other cities, [[Omiya, Saitama|Omiya]] and [[Yono, Saitama|Yono]], on May 1, 2001. In 2003, the former area of Urawa became [[Urawa-ku, Saitama|Urawa-ku]], Midori-ku, Minami-ku, and Sakura-ku, which are [[wards of Japan|wards]] of the city of Saitama. The city hall and the prefectural government building are located in Urawa-ku.

==History==
In the [[Edo period]], the area that became Urawa flourished as a posting station of the [[Nakasendō]], a highway connecting [[Edo]] (modern-day [[Tokyo]]) and [[Kyoto]]. But it was not as big a town as [[Iwatsuki-ku, Saitama|Iwatsuki]], which was the only [[castle town]] in the area of the modern-day city of Saitama.
In 1869, the Prefectural Government of [[Urawa Prefecture]] was set up, and the Government&amp;apos;s Office was located in Urawa. In 1871, Iwatsuki, Urawa, and Oshi Prefectures merged to form [[Saitama Prefecture]], and Urawa became the capital of this new Prefecture.

The [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]] heavily damaged Tokyo and many nearby cities. Although Urawa is not far from Tokyo, it suffered less damage than to Tokyo, [[Yokohama]], and other cities in [[Kantō region]], so many intellectuals, especially painters, moved to Urawa, and this old posting station started to change into a modern city.
Several neighboring villages then merged into Urawa, and in 1934, the town became a city.
The city existed up until the 2001 merger with [[Omiya, Saitama|Ōmiya]] and [[Yono, Saitama|Yono]] to form Saitama. At that time the city had a population of 488,000.
