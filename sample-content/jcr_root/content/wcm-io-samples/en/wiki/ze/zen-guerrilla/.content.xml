        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zen Guerrilla&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a rock band originally from Newark, Delaware and currently from [[San Francisco, California]]. Musically, the band evolved over their career. Their early sound was characterized by [[psychedelic]] elements, such as delayed [[guitar]]s and noise washes. Their unique sound gained a growing local following (winning several Philly music awards), however, did not increase marketability. Later, Zen Guerrilla fused [[blues (music)|blues]], [[Rock music|rock]] and [[gospel (music)|gospel]] to create a sound which could be likened to bands such as the [[Jon Spencer|Jon Spencer Blues Explosion]].

==History==
Zen Guerrilla formed in [[Newark, Delaware]] in the late 80s. Band members Andy Duvall (drums), Marcus Durant (vocals/harmonica),  Carl Horne (bass), and Rich Millman (guitar) came together from local bands Marcus Hook, The Gollywogs, Stone Groove and No Comment.

The band released their self-titled CD on [[Philadelphia]]-based [[Compulsiv Records]] in 1992 and Recorded at the world famous Third Story Recording Studio in Walnut Hill. Soon after, Zen Guerrilla moved to [[Philadelphia]] and were regular performers around the city at clubs such as the Kyber Pass Pub. Around this time the band began a heavy touring schedule, which would have them cross the country multiple times through the end of the decade.

Zen Guerrilla relocated to [[San Francisco]] in 1994. Their constant touring increased their exposure, and, combined with their explosive live show, helped to release albums first with [[Alternative Tentacles]] and later [[Subpop|Sub Pop]], which is known for being the original record company of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].

The band&amp;apos;s version of the song &amp;quot;Empty Heart&amp;quot; was featured in the 2000 PlayStation game &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Grind Session]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The band dissolved sometime around 2003.
