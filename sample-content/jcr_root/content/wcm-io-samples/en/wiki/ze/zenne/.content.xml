[[Image:Covering of the Senne EN v1.2.svg|thumb|right|288px|The 1837 course of the Senne superimposed on Brussels&amp;apos; modern downtown.]]
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zenne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-nl|ˈzɛnə|lang}}) or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Senne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-fr|sɛn|lang}}) is a small river that flows through [[Brussels]], left tributary of the [[Dijle]]/Dyle. Its spring is in the village of [[Naast_(Soignies)|Naast]] near the municipality of [[Soignies]]. It is an indirect tributary of the [[Scheldt]], through the [[Dijle]] and the [[Rupel]]. The [[Woluwe]] is one of the tributaries of the Zenne.

In total the Zenne is 103&amp;amp;nbsp;km long.

In the centre of Brussels, the Zenne was [[covering of the Senne|completely covered up]] and major boulevards were built over top in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It is still visible in the outskirts of Brussels and outside the city, though within the city it now runs mostly underneath the [[small ring]]. The Zenne was notorious for being one of Belgium&amp;apos;s worst [[Water pollution|polluted]] rivers, since all [[effluent]]s from the [[Brussels Capital Region]] were versed in it without treatment. In March 2007, the completion of new [[sewage treatment]] plants, began to remediate this problem. However, in December 2009 the plant Brussels Nord of Acquiris was temporarily and abruptly shut down, creating a political and ecological crisis.

The Golden [[Iris (plant)|Iris]] became used as the emblem of the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] due to its habitat in the marshy plains around the river. The unique seasonal wild [[yeast]]s of the Zenne river valley are used in the production of the regional [[lambic]] style of [[beer]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Jackson1988&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Michael|title=The new world guide to beer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_PQJAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2012|date=September 1988|publisher=Running Press|isbn=978-0-89471-649-2}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The [[Brasserie de la Senne]] is a recently opened brewery named for the river.

Despite the covering up of the Zenne resulting in the river being all but invisible in the centre of Brussels, it has had a cultural impact on the city. A nickname for residents of the city, &amp;apos;Zinneke&amp;apos;, is taken from the stray dogs which hung around the Zenne in the Middle Ages, known as &amp;apos;Zenneke&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;Zinneke&amp;apos;. The name was revived at the start of the 21st century with the creation of the [[Zinneke Parade]], a multicultural biennial event in the centre of Brussels.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;pvda2008&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pvda.be/nieuws/artikel/interview-met-myriam-stoffen-directrice-zinneke.html |title=Interview met Myriam Stoffen, directrice Zinneke |language=Dutch |date=2008-05-20 |accessdate=2011-05-22}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
