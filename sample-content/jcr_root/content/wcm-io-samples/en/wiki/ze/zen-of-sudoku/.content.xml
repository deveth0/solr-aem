&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zen of Sudoku&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Sudoku]] based [[computer and video games|computer game]] developed by Charlie Cleveland of [[Unknown Worlds Entertainment]] and released on June 20, 2006.  Although the [[casual games]] market is not the intended direction of Unknown Worlds, or of Cleveland, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zen of Sudoku&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was produced in order to generate revenue towards funding &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Natural Selection 2]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a sequel to the original &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Natural Selection (computer game)|Natural Selection]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; modification for [[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]].  Cleveland cites casual games development as a &amp;quot;last option&amp;quot; for funding this sequel, having been unwilling to sacrifice control of the company to external investors.&amp;lt;ref name=gamespot&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6155717.html|title=Charlie Cleveland&amp;apos;s small-game biz|accessdate=2006-09-04|author=Patrick Caldwell|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2006-08-17}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The game features automated generation of sudoku puzzles at varying difficulty levels as well as a hint and tutorial system, which not only teaches players the basics of the game, but also teaches them further advanced strategies.&amp;lt;ref name = gamespot/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=feature&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenofsudoku.com/changes|title=&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zen of Sudoku&amp;apos;&amp;apos; feature list and changelog|accessdate=2006-09-04}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Currently, the game is available for purchase directly from the website at http://www.zenofsudoku.com/, and on [[Valve Corporation]]&amp;apos;s [[Steam (software)|Steam platform]]. A [[Adobe Flash|flash]] based web version is also in production.&amp;lt;ref name=uworlds2&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknownworlds.com/index.html|title=Unknown Worlds Entertainment, news, July 17, 2006|accessdate=2006-09-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060826131711/http://www.unknownworlds.com/index.html |archivedate = August 26, 2006}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Gameplay==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zen of Sudoku&amp;apos;&amp;apos; does not change any of the standard gameplay rules of sudoku. Its main focus is that you can &amp;quot;Relax with hand-painted Japanese-styled backgrounds, no timer and lush natural soundscapes.&amp;quot; Rather than use background music, typical wildlife noises are played, with simple harp-like tones played in response to numbers entered. Like many other computer sudoku games, players can select a specific difficulty level, and can be provided tutorials for basic play and strategies.
