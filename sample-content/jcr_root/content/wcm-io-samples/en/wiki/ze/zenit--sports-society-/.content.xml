&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zenit&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Зенит}}; meaning [[zenith]]) was the [[All-Union]] [[Voluntary Sports Societies of the USSR|Voluntary Sports Society]] for workers of [[arms industry]], established in 1936. Due to reorganization of sports societies, between 1957 and 1966 physical culture collectives of Zenit were a part of VSS Trud from the [[Russian SFSR]], and other republican sports societies. In 1966 Zenit again became a separate VSS. In the 1970s Zenit had about 1,000 large sports constructions, 13,000 sports and football grounds, more than 100 [[Children and Youth Sport School]]s.

The name has been retained after the fall of the Soviet Union and the VSS system, notably by [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg]], which won the [[Russian Premier League 2007|2007]] and [[Russian Premier League 2010|2010 Russian Premier League]] seasons, the [[UEFA Cup 2007-08|2007-08 UEFA Cup]], and the [[2008 UEFA Super Cup]] in [[association football]].
