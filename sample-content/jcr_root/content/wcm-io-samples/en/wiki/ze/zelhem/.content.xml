&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zelhem&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a village in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] province of [[Gelderland]]. It has approximately 11.000 inhabitants. Zelhem is located in the municipality of [[Bronckhorst]], about 7&amp;amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Doetinchem]].

Zelhem was a separate municipality until 2005, when it became a part of Bronckhorst.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |first=Ad |last=van der Meer |coauthors=Onno Boonstra |title=Repertorium van Nederlandse gemeenten |publisher=KNAW |year=2006 |url=http://www.knaw.nl/cfdata/publicaties/detail.cfm?boeken__ordernr=20061061 |isbn=90-6984-495-8 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The municipality used to cover an area of 81.89&amp;amp;nbsp;km².

==History==
The village is more than 1200 years old. The modern name Zelhem originated from Salehem. This name was given to the village when a chapel was built and a gift-document was presented to the inhabitants.

The name Salehem comes from two words &amp;apos;Sale&amp;apos; which means &amp;apos;house&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;heim&amp;apos; which means &amp;apos;place where people are home&amp;apos;.

The founder of this chapel was a passionate preacher called Liudger. He brought religion to the land of the Saksen. Between 1450 and 1500 the church as we know it was built. It was dedicated to [[St. Lambertus]], [[bishop of Maastricht]] in the time of Ludger (hence the name &amp;apos;Lambertikerk&amp;apos;).

==The myth of Smoks Hanne==
The village also has a myth of &amp;apos;Smokshanne&amp;apos;. She lived in Zelhem somewhere in the nineteenth century. Nowadays she&amp;apos;s pictured as a good witch flying on a broom. The funny part is that Smokshanne only has one clog (on her left foot) and the broom she&amp;apos;s flying on is backwards. It is assumed that Smokshanne lost her clog during flight. Unfortunately there&amp;apos;s not much information about this old lady. But when the village celebrated its 1200th anniversary, the theme was all about her.
