{{for|the Italian goalkeeper|Walter Zenga}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zenga&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for the practice and art of [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] painting and [[calligraphy]] in the [[Japanese tea ceremony]] and also the [[martial arts]].

==Definition==
As a noun, Zenga is a style of Japanese calligraphy and painting, done in [[ink]]. In many instances, both calligraphy and image will be in the same piece. The calligraphy denotes a poem, or saying, that teaches some element of the true path of Zen. The brush painting is characteristically simple, bold and abstract.
==History==
Though [[Zen Buddhism]] had arrived in [[Japan]] at the end of the 12th-century, Zenga (as here described) didn&amp;apos;t come into its own until the beginning of the [[Edo period]] in 1600.

==Subject matter==
In keeping with individual paths to [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], nearly any subject matter can lend (and has lent) itself to Zenga. Everything from a cat, to a [[bamboo]] shoot, to a man defecating in a field has been used to illustrate a particular point - although [[Ensō|enso]], sticks and [[Mt. Fuji]] are the most common elements.
