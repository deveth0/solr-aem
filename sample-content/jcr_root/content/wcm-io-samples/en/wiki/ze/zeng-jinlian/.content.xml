&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zeng Jinlian&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|s=曾金莲|t=曾金蓮|p=&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zēng Jīnlián&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}; June 25, 1964&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;ndash; February 13, 1982) was the tallest [[woman]] ever verified in medical history, taking over [[Jane Bunford]]&amp;apos;s record.  Zeng is also the only woman counted among the fourteen people who have reached verified heights of eight feet or more.

At the time of her death at the age of 17 in [[Hunan]], [[China]], Zeng, who would have been 8 feet, 1.75 inches tall (she could not stand straight because of a severely deformed [[vertebral column|spine]]), was the tallest person in the world. She had also broken [[Robert Wadlow]]&amp;apos;s previous record of tallest 17 year-old ever. In the year between [[Don Koehler]]&amp;apos;s death and her own, she surpassed fellow &amp;quot;eight-footers&amp;quot; [[Gabriel Estêvão Monjane]] and [[Suleiman Ali Nashnush]].  That Zeng&amp;apos;s growth patterns mirrored those of Robert Wadlow is shown in the table below.

She was the second ever woman in the history to become the Tallest Recognized person in the world, [[Jane Bunford]] was the first.
