A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;zero-hour contract&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;zero-hours contract&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a type of [[employment contract|contract]] under which an [[employer]] does not guarantee the [[employee]] a fixed number of [[working hours|hours per week]]. Rather, the employee is expected to be [[wikt:on-call|on-call]] and receive compensation only for hours worked.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19263787 |title=BBC News - Do zero hours contracts create real jobs? |publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2012-08-14 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Standing, Guy. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/09/zero-hours-contracts-1990s-russial &amp;quot;Why zero-hours contracts remind me of the horrors of 1990s Russia&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Guardian]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, London, 9 April 2013. Retrieved on 23 April 2013&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Sutherland and Canwell have defined zero-hour contract as an arrangement between an employer and an employee who has agreed to be available for work as and when required, so that no particular number of hours of times of work are specified.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Zero-hour contracts may suit some people{{who|date=August 2012}} who want occasional earnings, but they do run the risk of being misused, for instance when employees are asked to stop work during quiet periods but remain on the premises in case they are needed.{{or|date=August 2012}}

Alternatively, zero-hour contracts can simply be read as a means for companies to get away with paying their employees less, by making their continued employment dependent on their ability to work at any time without notice, while also not having to pay them during quieter periods. It is a modern form of [[indentured servant|indentured servitude]], reflective of a widening poverty gap and the wholesale destruction of workers&amp;apos; rights.{{POV-statement|date=March 2013}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], under the [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998]], workers operating under a zero-hour contract on stand-by time, on-call time and downtime must be paid the national minimum wage, provided they are worked for. Similarly, this amount of time on premises is likely to count as working time under the [[Working Time Regulations 1998]] (1998, 1999, and 2002) provided the worker is required to be on-call at the place of work.{{or|date=August 2012}}

Zero-hour contracts are pervading many levels of the working world. As Ian Brinkley of the think-tank [[the Work Foundation]] states, &amp;quot;Everyone thinks they are the bargain basement end of the labour market: bar work, the worst aspects of retail, hospitality and restaurants. [...] But there’s actually quite a lot in education and health services.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Kuuchler, Hannah. [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ff75254e-9f89-11e2-b4b6-00144feabdc0.html &amp;quot;&amp;apos;Zero hours&amp;apos; contracts numbers leap&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Financial Times]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, London, 7 April 2013. Retrieved on 23 April 2013&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [...] However, it is possible that the incidence is being under-reported [in other industries], because while people may be aware they are employed on a casual basis, they may not be aware that the contract is called zero hours.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Brinkley, Ian. [http://www.theworkfoundation.com/blog/872/Zero-hours-contracts-and-the-flexible-labour-market &amp;quot;&amp;apos;Zero hours contracts and the flexible labour market&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Work Foundation blog]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, London, 17 August 2012.

Retrieved on 1 May 2013&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It could also be the case that &amp;quot;zero hours may be more significant in replacing existing forms of flexibility rather than leading a dramatic shift towards insecure working.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Brinkley, Ian.
