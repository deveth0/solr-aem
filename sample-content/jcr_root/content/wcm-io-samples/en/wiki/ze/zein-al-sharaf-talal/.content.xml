&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zein al-Sharaf Talal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2 August 1916 – 26 April 1994) was the [[Queen consort|Queen]] of [[Jordan]] and wife of [[King Talal]]. She was also mother of [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]].

==Family==
She was born in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]] to [[Sharif]] Jamal bin Nasser, [[Governor]] of [[Hauran]] and Wijdan Hanim. Her father was the nephew of Sharif [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein bin Ali]] of [[Mecca]] and her mother was the daughter of Shakir [[Pasha]], [[Governor]] of [[Cyprus]].

==Marriage and children==
Zein married then her first cousin [[Talal of Jordan|Prince Talal bin Abdullah of Jordan]] on 27 November 1934, with whom she bore four sons and two daughters:

*[[King Hussein]] (14 November 1935 – 7 February 1999)
*Princess Asma (deceased, at birth in 1937)
*[[Prince Muhammad bin Talal|Prince Muhammad]] (born 2 October 1940)
*[[Prince Hassan|Prince El Hassan]] (born 20 March 1947)
*Prince Muhsin (deceased)
*[[Princess Basma bint Talal|Princess Basma]] (born 11 May 1951)

==Career==
Queen Zein played a major role in the political development of the Jordanian Kingdom in the early 1950s, by supporting efforts in [[Charity (practice)|charitable works]] and [[Women’s rights|women&amp;apos;s rights]].

She took part in the writing of the 1952 [[Constitution]] that gave certain rights to women and enhanced the social development of the country. She also created the first women’s [[Trade union|union]] of Jordan in 1944. Queen Zein further filled a constitutional vacuum after the assassination of the late [[Abdullah I of Jordan|King Abdullah I]] in 1951, while the newly proclaimed King Talal was being treated outside the Kingdom. The Queen again performed this role during the period between August 1952, when her son, King Hussein, was proclaimed monarch, and May 1953, when he assumed constitutional duties at the age of eighteen.

Following the arrival of [[Palestinian refugee]]s into Jordan after the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], she led national relief efforts to help the tens of thousands of refugees. She was also instrumental in establishing the women&amp;apos;s branch of the Jordan National [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Crescent Society]] in 1948. Throughout her life, Queen Zein dedicated time and energy to the Um Al Hussein [[orphanage]] in [[Amman]].
