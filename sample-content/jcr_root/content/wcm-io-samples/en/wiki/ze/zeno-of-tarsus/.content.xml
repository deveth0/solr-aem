&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zeno&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or Zenon, {{lang-el|Ζήνων}}; [[floruit|fl.]] 200 BC) of [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] was a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher.

He was a pupil of [[Chrysippus]],&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Diog1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{ws|Diogenes Laërtius, [[s:Lives of the Eminent Philosophers/Book VII|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lives of the Eminent Philosophers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, vii.]] 35}} Cf. 41, 84&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and when Chrysippus died c. 206 BC, he succeeded him to become the fourth head of the Stoic school in [[Athens]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Euseb1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Eusebius, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_15_book15.htm &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Praeparatio Evangelica,&amp;apos;&amp;apos;] 15. 18.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

According to [[Diogenes Laërtius]], he wrote very few books, but left a great number of disciples.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Diog1&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; From what little is known about his philosophical views, he was an orthodox Stoic, but doubted the doctrine of the [[Ekpyrosis|conflagration of the universe]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Euseb1&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  This was a considerable modification of the physical theory of the Stoics, who held that the universe periodically dissolved into fire.

It is not known when he died.  He was succeeded as head of the Stoic school by [[Diogenes of Babylon]].
