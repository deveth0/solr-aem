        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zenith number&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a special type of [[toll-free telephone number]] in the United States and Canada that was introduced prior to the development of [[Wide Area Telephone Service|WATS]] toll-free service. It allows a [[calling party]] to call the number&amp;apos;s owner at no charge by dialing the [[Switchboard operator|operator]] and requesting the specified Zenith number.  In some places the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Enterprise&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or the letters &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;WX&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are used.  Some organizations continue to keep their Zenith numbers - as of 2006, the [[California Highway Patrol]] continues to use the same single number it has for decades, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zenith 1-2000&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://massis.lcs.mit.edu/telecom-archives/TELECOM_Digest_Online2006-1/1390.html Remembering Old Zenith Numbers]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; But with the low cost of incoming WATS service, Zenith numbers have nearly disappeared and telephone companies in most service areas no longer offer new Zenith numbers.{{fact|date=May 2012}}

The Zenith number was listed in local telephone directories in each community from which a business desired to receive calls. The operator handled the call by looking up the regular number corresponding to the Zenith number, typically in a paper book kept at the switchboard, and completing the call as if it were a collect call to the regular number.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Your special ZENITH number: ZENITH phone service gets you out-of-town customers without costly branch offices|publisher=The Spokesman-Review, Spokane WA|page=7|format=advertisement|author=Pacific Telephone|date=Friday August 21, 1959|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;amp;dat=19590821&amp;amp;id=xJwzAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=y-cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=3027,1885047 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The numbers were originally advertised in the 1950s, an era in which direct-dial numbers were commonly published with [[telephone exchange names]] followed by digits (such as &amp;quot;[[PEnnsylvania 6-5000]]&amp;quot;). The reason the name Zenith is used is that the letter Z did not, at the time that the service started, appear on the telephone dial, thus necessitating that the caller dial the operator.{{fact|date=May 2012}}
