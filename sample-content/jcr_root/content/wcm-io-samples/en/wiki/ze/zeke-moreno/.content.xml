&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ezekiel Aaron Moreno&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born October 8, 1978) is a professional [[American football]] [[linebacker]].

==Early years==
Moreno attended [[Castle Park High School]] in Chula Vista and was a letterman in football and baseball.  In football, as a senior, he led his team to a state championship in 1996. It was actually a &amp;quot;mythical&amp;quot; state championship, because the state of California does not have a state championship.

==College career==
Moreno played [[college football]] for the [[University of Southern California]]&amp;apos;s defense from 1998-2000.  Known as &amp;quot;Zeke And Destroy&amp;quot; by many USC-faithful, Moreno was a force in the middle of the USC defense.

==Professional career==
Moreno was [[NFL draft|drafted]] by the [[San Diego Chargers]] in the fifth round (139th pick overall) of the [[2001 NFL Draft]].  He played for the Chargers for four years (2001â€“2004).  Moreno was released by the Chargers following the 2004 season and was hampered by injuries while trying to find a home with another team in 2005. He signed with the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] in 2007. He was selected as a CFL All-Star in 2007 and 2008.

On September 9, 2008, Moreno was traded to the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/story/2008/09/08/cfl-bluebombers-tigercats.html Blue Bombers tweak trade for Zeke Moreno]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On February 19, 2009, Moreno was traded to the [[Toronto Argonauts]] in exchange for defensive end [[Riall Johnson]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sportsnet.ca/football/cfl/2009/02/18/argos_moreno/ Argos acquire Moreno from Bombers]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On February 21, 2010, Moreno was released by the Argonauts.

==Records==
-most single season tackles by a Hamilton Tiger-Cat (114)

==Personal==
He married Christina Hernandez in 2002. They have one son Lorenzo &amp;quot;Zo&amp;quot; Ezekial Moreno.

His brother, [[Moses Moreno]], also played in the [[National Football League]] as a [[quarterback]].
