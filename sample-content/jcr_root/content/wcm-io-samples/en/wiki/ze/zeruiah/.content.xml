        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zeruiah&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-en|z|ə|ˈ|r|uː|j|ə|}} ({{script|Hebr|}}צרויה, sometime transliterated &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tzruya&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zeruya&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), daughter of King [[Nahash of Ammon]] ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|17:25|HE}}) and stepdaughter of [[Jesse]] of the Tribe of Judah, was an older sister of King [[David]]. Zeruiah had three sons, [[Abishai (Bible)|Abishai]], [[Joab]], and [[Asahel]], all of whom were soldiers in David&amp;apos;s army.

Very little is told of her. However, her sons are invariably mentioned with the [[matronymic]] &amp;quot;son of Zeruiah&amp;quot;, in marked contrast to most other Biblical characters (and people in many other cultures) who are known by a [[patronymic]]. This seems to indicate that she was an exceptionally strong or important woman, though the specific circumstances are not given.

Her name is used—though not very frequently—as a female given name in contemporary Israel (see [[Tzruya Lahav]], [[Zeruya Shalev]]).
