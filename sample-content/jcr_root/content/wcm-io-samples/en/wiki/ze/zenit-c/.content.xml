&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zenit-C&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[sounding rocket]] developed from Oerlikon Contraves (today [[Rheinmetall Air Defence]] in [[Switzerland]]. The Zenit was a single-step rocket with a length of 5.6 meters, a diameter of 0.42 meter and a takeoff weight of 610 kilograms. Propelled by a solid-propellant engine which supplied a thrust between 45 kN at launch and 22 kN in flight, the Zenit could carry a payload of 25 kilograms to a height of 210 km or a payload of 130 kilograms to a height of 115 km. At its maiden flight on October 27, 1967 at [[Salto di Quirra]] the Zenit topped 145 km. The Zenit was later launched only twice &amp;amp;mdash; once on July 30, 1971 at Salto di Quirra with a British [[Cuckoo (rocket)|Cuckoo]] rocket as a starting stage and once on December 13, 1973 at [[AndÃ¸ya]] likewise with a &amp;quot;Cuckoo&amp;quot; starting stage. Oerlikon used the knowleg from the Ground to Air Missile RSE Kriens for the Zenit.
