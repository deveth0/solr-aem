[[File:ICEPICK2.jpg|thumb|A standard ice pick]]

An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ice pick&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a tool used to break up, pick at, or chip at [[ice]]. It resembles a [[scratch awl]], but is designed for picking at ice rather than wood. Before the invention of modern [[refrigerators]], ice picks were a ubiquitous household tool used for separating and shaping the blocks of ice used in [[ice box]]es.

Outside the USA, the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ice pick&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also commonly refers to a mountaineers&amp;apos; tool known in the USA as an [[ice axe]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0397520 Oxford Dictionaries â€“ Ice pick]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Other uses==
Like most other tools, ice picks have been used for more than their intended use. For example, [[mafia]] [[hitman]] [[Abe Reles|Abe &amp;quot;Kid Twist&amp;quot; Reles]] used an ice pick as his [[weapon]] of choice. Fellow [[Murder, Inc.]] hitman [[Harry Strauss|Harry &amp;quot;Pittsburgh Phil&amp;quot; Strauss]] also employed an ice pick as a weapon. On the show &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Deadliest Warrior]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the ice pick is featured as a &amp;quot;Mafia weapon&amp;quot; and shown to be capable of piercing through bone easily. In the 1992 movie &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Basic Instinct]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, multiple characters are stabbed with ice picks. A lead female character in Linwood Barclay&amp;apos;s 2012 thriller &amp;quot;Trust Your Eyes&amp;quot; uses an ice pick to kill people.

[[Neurologist]] [[Walter Freeman (neurologist)|Walter Freeman]] used medical instruments called [[leucotome]]s, and later [[orbitoclast]]s, both of which were essentially ice picks, to perform transorbital [[lobotomy|lobotomies]]. This operation was informally called &amp;quot;ice pick lobotomy&amp;quot;: the leucotome was hammered into the patient&amp;apos;s brain with a rubber [[mallet]] via the eye&amp;apos;s [[tear duct]].

The murder weapon used in the assassination of [[Leon Trotsky]] was a mountaineering ice pick which in American English speaking countries is called an [[ice axe]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Conquest, Robert. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Great Terror: A Reassessment&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Oxford University Press, 1991, ISBN 0-19-507132-8, p. 418.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
