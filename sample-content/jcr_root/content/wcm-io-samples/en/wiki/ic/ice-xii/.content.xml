[[File:Icexii-ru.jpg|thumb|250px|The crystal structure of ice XII]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ice XII&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[metastable]], [[density|dense]], [[crystalline]] [[phase (matter)|phase]] of [[solid]] [[water]], a type of [[ice]]. Ice XII was first reported in 1996 by C. Lobban, J.L. Finney and W.F. Kuhs and, after initial caution, was properly identified in 1998.

It was first obtained by cooling [[liquid]] water to {{convert|260|K|°C °F|lk=in}} at a pressure of {{convert|0.55|GPa|lk=in|atm}}. Ice XII was discovered existing within the phase stability region of [[ice V]]. Later research showed that ice XII could be created outside that range. Pure ice XII can be created from [[ice Ih|ice I&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;h&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;]] at {{convert|77|K}} by rapid compression (0.81-1.00 GPa/min) or by warming [[high density amorphous ice]] at pressures between {{convert|0.8|to|1.6|GPa|atm}}. The proton-ordered form of ice XII is [[ice XIV]].

While it is similar in density (1.29 g/cm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-size:87%;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; at {{convert|127|K}}) to [[ice IV]] (also found in the [[ice V]] space) it exists as a [[tetragonal]] [[crystal]]. [[Topology|Topologically]] it is a mix of seven- and eight-membered rings, a 4-connected net (4-coordinate [[sphere]] packing)—the densest possible arrangement without [[hydrogen bond interpenetration]].

Ordinary water ice is known as [[ice Ih|ice I&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;h&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;]], (in the [[Percy Williams Bridgman|Bridgman]] nomenclature). Different types of ice, from [[ice II]] to [[ice XV]], have been created in the laboratory at different temperatures and pressures.
