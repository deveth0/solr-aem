[[Image:Icchak_Cukierman.jpg|thumb|250px|Icchak Cukierman testifies for the prosecution during the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]].]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Icchak Cukierman&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (December 13, 1915 in [[Vilnius]] &amp;amp;ndash; June 17, 1981 in [[Lohamey ha-Geta&amp;apos;ot]], [[Israel]]), also known by his [[nom de guerre]] &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Antek]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;, or by the anglicised spelling &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yitzhak Zuckerman&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was one of the leaders of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] 1943 and fighter of [[Warsaw Uprising]] 1944 both heroic struggle against Nazi German terror during [[World War II]].

Cukierman was born in [[Vilnius]], [[Partitions of Poland|partioned Poland]] (then part of the Russian Empire) into a [[Jewish]] family. As a young man he embraced the concepts of [[socialism]] and [[Zionism]].

After the [[Polish Defence War|German and Soviet invasion of Poland]] in 1939 he was in the area overrun by the [[Red Army]] and initially stayed in the Soviet zone of occupation, where he took active part in creation of various Jewish underground socialist organisations. In the spring of 1940 he moved to [[Warsaw]], where he became a leader of the leaders of the [[Habonim Dror|Dror Hechaluc]] youth movement, along with his future wife [[Zivia Lubetkin]].

In 1941 he became the deputy commander of the [[Żydowska Organizacja Bojowa|ŻOB]] resistance organisation. In this capacity, he served mainly as the envoy between the commander of ŻOB and the commanders of the Polish resistance organizations of [[Armia Krajowa]] and [[Armia Ludowa]]. On December 22, 1942, he and two accomplices attacked a café in [[Kraków]] that was being used by the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and [[Gestapo]]. Cukierman was wounded and narrowly escaped, and his two comrades were tracked down and killed.

In 1943, he was working on the &amp;quot;[[Ghettos_in_Nazi-occupied_Europe#Aryan_side|Aryan]]&amp;quot; side of [[Warsaw]] to procure guns and ammunition when the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] erupted.  Unable to enter the ghetto to join his comrades in battle, he nonetheless proved a crucial link between resistance forces within the ghetto and the [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] on the &amp;quot;[[Aryan]]&amp;quot; side. Along with [[Simcha Rotem|Simcha &amp;quot;Kazik&amp;quot; Rotem]], he organized the escape of the surviving ZOB fighters through the sewers to safety. During the later [[Warsaw Uprising]] of 1944, he led a small troop of 322 survivors of the Ghetto Uprising as they fought the Germans in the ranks of the Home Army.

After the war he worked as part of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Berihah]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; network, whose operatives smuggled Jewish refugees out of Eastern and Central Europe to [[British Mandate of Palestine|Mandate Palestine]]. In 1947 he himself made that journey, settling in what would soon be [[Israel]]. There he and his wife Zivia, along with other veterans of the ghetto undergrounds and former [[Jewish partisans|partisan]]s, were among the founding members of [[Kibbutz]] [[Lohamey ha-Geta&amp;apos;ot]] and the [[Ghetto Fighters&amp;apos; House]] (GFH) museum located on its grounds, commemorating those who struggled against the Nazis. GFH has a study center named for Zivia and Yitzhak Zuckerman.

In 1961 he appeared as a witness at the trial of Nazi [[war crime|war criminal]] [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Israel. He died in 1981, in the kibbutz he had founded.

A record of a lengthy interview he gave in 1976 was expanded into the book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sheva ha-Shanim ha-Hen: 1939-1946&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [Hebrew: Those Seven Years] published in Israel in 1991, later translated into English and published as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Surplus of Memory: Chronicle of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

His granddaughter [[Roni Zuckerman]] became the [[Israeli Air Force]]&amp;apos;s first female fighter pilot.

In 2001, the tale of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was turned into a made-for-TV film entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Uprising (film)|Uprising]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, with actor [[David Schwimmer]] portraying Zuckerman.
