The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Icy Strait&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[strait]] in the [[Alexander Archipelago]] in southeastern [[Alaska]], at about {{coord|58|16|41|N|135|38|48|W|scale:1000000|display=inline,title}}. The strait separates [[Chichagof Island]] to the south and the Alaska mainland to the north.  The strait is {{convert|64|km|mi|abbr=on}} from its west side at the intersection of the [[Cross Sound]] and [[Glacier Bay]] to its east side at [[Chatham Strait]] and the [[Lynn Canal]]. The two largest islands in the strait are [[Pleasant Island (Alaska)|Pleasant Island]] and [[Lemesurier Island]].

The [[Cape Spencer Light (Alaska)|Cape Spencer Light]] is an important former lighthouse and currently active aid-to-navigation.

The [[cruise ship]] [[Empress of the North]] ran aground near Rocky Island &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Alaskan_cruise_ship_evacuated&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and took on some water here on May 14, 2007, causing the evacuation of its passengers. None were injured.
