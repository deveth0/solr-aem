&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ivan &amp;apos;Ico&amp;apos; Hitrec&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (13 April 1911 – 11 October 1946) is widely considered as the greatest [[Croatia]]n [[football (soccer)|football]] player before [[World War II]].

The centre-forward became a legend after scoring twice against then famous Spanish keeper [[Ricardo Zamora]] during the first night game in [[Zagreb]] between Zagreb and [[Madrid]] in 1933. As one of the first Croatian international players, he went on to play for [[Grasshopper-Club Zürich|Grasshopper]] of [[Switzerland]], and &amp;quot;[[Kicker (magazine)|Kicker]]&amp;quot;, at the time the foremost sports journal in Europe, chose him as a member of the European elite 11.

Hitrec was also a goal-scorer for the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Kingdom of Yugoslavia national team]]. He appeared in 14 international games and scored 9 goals in 7 of them. He was one of seven Croatian players to boycott the Yugoslavian national team at the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] after the [[Football Association of Yugoslavia]] was moved from [[Zagreb]] to [[Belgrade]].

He was also the first technical officer and in his office in the Zagreb power-works in Gundulićeva street, the best players from [[Gradjanski|Građanski]] met and discussed forming a new club with blue shirts which later became [[Dinamo Zagreb]].

Hitrec was quoted as saying that he didn&amp;apos;t like to perform 11m [[penalty kick (football)|penalty kicks]] because they were &amp;quot;too close&amp;quot; (to the goal). He was able to [[Sprint (race)|sprint]] 100 meters in under 12 seconds which was quite fast given that the fastest sprinter at the time [[Jesse Owens]] ran the 100-meter dash in 10.30 seconds.
