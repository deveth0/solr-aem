&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Umgababa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a rural community area with a large market place for tourists in [[KwaZulu-Natal]], [[South Africa]]. It forms part of [[eThekwini]]. The uMgababa River (originally &amp;quot;Umkababa&amp;quot;, which means &amp;quot;my father&amp;apos;s wife&amp;quot;) enters the ocean at Umgababa. The name is derived from an ancient feud between the Luthuli tribe who used to live in the valley. [[Litchi]]s are produced in this region. There once was a large [[titanium]] mine here but it closed due to serious sea pollution. In the few years it has grown from rural area into a semi-vacation place, number of people are moving to the lovely place to enjoy the true beauty of nature. The area now hosts the annually biggest year-end event consisting many popular South African musicians on New Year&amp;apos;s Eve.
