The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Family Islands&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are a group of continental islands lying a short distance off the coast, about mid-way between Cairns and Townsville, in [[Far North Queensland]], Australia. Most of the area has been designated as a national park. The islands were given their collective name and also English names by Captain Cook when he sailed through the area in 1770.

The island group are [[continental island]]s.  They were part of the mainland until roughly 8,000 years ago when the sea level rose.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nch&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.derm.qld.gov.au/parks/family-islands/culture.html |title=Family Islands National Park: Nature, culture and history |date=3 April 2012|publisher=Department of Environment and Resource Management |accessdate=20 August 2012 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==The Islands==
The largest of the Family Islands, their Aboriginal names, and their position in the &amp;quot;family&amp;quot; are:
* [[Dunk Island]] (Coonanglebah) – the father
* Richards Island ([[Bedarra Island|Bedarra]]) – the mother
* [[Wheeler Island (Queensland)|Wheeler Island]] (Toolgbar) and Coombe Island (Coomba) – the twins
* Smith Island (Kurrumbah), [[Bowden Island]] (Budjoo) and [[Hudson Island]] (Coolah) – the triplets.

There are also a number of smaller islands:
* [[Kumboola Island|Kumboola]], which is connected to Dunk Island on particularly low tides
* Mound Island (Purtaboi), which is protected as a sea bird nesting habitat
* Woln Garin, a small island off Dunk Island&amp;apos;s south east corner, known locally as &amp;quot;40ft Rock&amp;quot;
* Battleship Rock (Pee-Rahm-Ah), named because of its distinctive shape when seen from the north.
* [[Thorpe Island]] (Ti mana), which is privately owned with one residence. This is the only Australian island which is owned [[Fee simple|Freehold]].

==Facilities==
Camp grounds are available on Dunk, Coombe and Wheeler Islands, with permits available from Queensland Parks and Wildlife.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ci&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.derm.qld.gov.au/parks/family-islands/camping.html |title=Family Islands National Park: Camping information |date=3 April 2012|publisher=Department of Environment and Resource Management |accessdate=20 August 2012 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Resorts operate on [[Dunk Island|Dunk]] and Bedarra Islands.
