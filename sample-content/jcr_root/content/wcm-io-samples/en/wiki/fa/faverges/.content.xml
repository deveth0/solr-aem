&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Faverges&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Haute-Savoie]] [[Departments of France|department]] in the [[Rhône-Alpes]] [[Regions of France|region]] in south-eastern [[France]].

It occupies the glacial valley which gave birth to [[Lake Annecy]].

==Geology==
Originally, at the end of the [[ice age]], the lake extended some 30&amp;amp;nbsp;km, from [[Sillingy]] all the way to the site of Faverges, at the base of the [[Dent de Cons]] mountain. In those times, the waters of the lake joined the [[Isère River|river Isère]], and people first settled the lakeshores and sunny slopes.

==History==
The digs in Viuz and at the Thovey site in Faverges have yielded a great deal of information about [[Gallo-Roman]] times, some two thousand years ago. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Vicus (Rome)|vicus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of Viuz, which covered some fifty acres (200,000&amp;amp;nbsp;m²), was an important stop along the [[Roman road]] which ran from [[Turin]] to [[Geneva]]. [[Merovingian]] times also left numerous traces on the landscape. In the [[Middle Ages]], pre-industrial metalworks were renowned for their iron and copper tools and jewelry. Numerous forges, making nails, clasps, and all types of iron implements, were built along the rivers and streams from which they derived some of their energy needs. The [[Tamié Abbey]] was founded in 1132, and Faverges castle around 1250. At that time, Rodolphe (or &amp;quot;Ruph&amp;quot;) lived a hermit&amp;apos;s life on a nearby mountain and left his name to the hamlet of [[St. Ruph]]. The deep religious fervor of the 14th and 15th centuries is responsible for the ten chapels and sanctuaries dedicated to St. Ruph in the area.

The [[French Revolution]] left few traces on the community, except for some vandalism to the town church. In 1811, the castle was turned into a cotton-weaving factory, thus launching Faverges into the [[Industrial Revolution]]. This is a fitting heritage for a town whose name derives from the [[Latin]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;faber&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;fabricae&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;manufacture&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

==Economy==
Faverges now has several important factories ([[Stäubli]], [[S.T. Dupont]], Bourgeois) providing some 2,500 jobs, which is especially remarkable in that Faverges itself has only some 7,000 inhabitants.
