&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Faimalaga Luka&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 15, 1940 â€“ August 19, 2005) was a political figure from the [[Pacific]] nation of [[Tuvalu]]. He served as [[Governor-General of Tuvalu|Governor-General]] and the [[Prime Minister of Tuvalu|Prime Minister]] of [[Tuvalu]].

==Background==

He was a broadcaster and politician, spending 40 years in the civil service and in politics,&amp;lt;ref name=PacificMagazine&amp;gt;[http://www.pacificmagazine.net/issue/2005/10/01/people-briefs Pacific Magazine]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; serving in roles including Minister for Health from 1994 to 1996 and Minister of Home Affairs from 1999 to 2001.

==Prime Minister==
He became [[Prime Minister of Tuvalu]] from 24 February 2001 after the previous Prime Minister, [[Ionatana Ionatana]], died of a heart attack in December 2000.&amp;lt;ref name=FreedomHouse&amp;gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/modules/mod_call_dsp_country-fiw.cfm?year=2006&amp;amp;country=7079 Freedom House]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Within a year of taking office, Luka lost a vote of no confidence on 14 December 2001 and was forced to resign as Prime Minister, being replaced by [[Koloa Talake]].&amp;lt;ref name=FreedomHouse /&amp;gt;

==Speaker of Parliament==

In June 2003 he became Speaker of Parliament, although an opposition MP at the time.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;RNZI_5191&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;amp;id=5191 |title=Tuvalu has new speaker |date=24 June 2003 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=30 September 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Governor-General==

Luka was appointed as Governor-General on 9 September 2003, as the representative of HM [[Queen Elizabeth II]], who is [[Tuvalu]]&amp;apos;s [[head of state]]. He retired on 15 April 2005&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;RDG&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |last1= Craig |first1= Robert D.  |authorlink1= |title= Historical Dictionary of Polynesia|url= |format= |accessdate=  |year= 2010 |publisher= Scarecrow Press|location= |language= |isbn=|oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; after reaching his 65th birthday. Tuvalu, unlike most countries, has a mandatory retirement age for all civil servants.

Historical note: Luka was the only [[Governor-General of Tuvalu]] not to accept a Knighthood. The practice of a Governor-General accepting a Knighthood was resumed by Luka&amp;apos;s successor to that office, Sir [[Filoimea Telito]].

==Death==

He died on August 19, 2005 in [[Fiji]] where he had been referred for medical treatment.&amp;lt;ref name=PacificMagazine /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://archives.pireport.org/archive/2007/March/tcp-tv.htm PACIFIC ISLANDS REPORT - Polynesia in Review: Issues and Events, 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
