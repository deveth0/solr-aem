&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Faraway Hill&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the first [[soap opera]] broadcast on an [[United States|American]] [[television network]], running on the [[DuMont Television Network]].

==Broadcast history==
The series ran from October 2, 1946 to December 18, 1946. David P. Lewis, the writer and director, had a budget of around $300 an episode.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;BM&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Brooks, Tim &amp;amp; Marsh, Earle (1964). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (3rd ed.). New York: Ballantine. ISBN 0-345-31864-1&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The show&amp;apos;s plot revolved around a widowed [[New York City|New Yorker]], Karen St. John (played by Flora Campbell), who moved to a small town to be near relatives. There she met a man who had been adopted by her family, and with whom she fell in love. However, he was already engaged to another woman. In addition, there were clashes between the sophisticated St. John and her rural relatives.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;BM&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Other actors included [[Mel Brandt]], [[Eve McVeagh]], and Julie Christy (not to be confused with actress [[Julie Christie]]).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;BM&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

The half-hour show was broadcast live, although filmed excerpts were interspersed, and slides of scenes from previous shows were included in later episodes to bring viewers up to date with regard to plot elements which had previously transpired. A narrator gave Karen&amp;apos;s thoughts as bridges between scenes.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;BM&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Episode status==
No footage from the series has survived (methods to record television such as [[kinescope]]s did not exist until 1947). The original script is owned by the Lewis family.
