The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;fallacy of the single cause&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;complex cause&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;causal oversimplification&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;causal reductionism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;reduction fallacy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Causal Reductionism&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Causal Reductionism|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/65-causal-reductionism|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; is a [[fallacy]] of [[questionable cause]] that occurs when it is assumed that there is a single, simple cause of an outcome when in reality it may have been caused by a number of only jointly [[sufficient causes]].

It can be logically reduced to: X occurred after Y. Therefore, Y caused X (although A,B,C...etc also caused X.)&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Causal Reductionism&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

Often after a tragedy it is asked, &amp;quot;What was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the&amp;apos;&amp;apos; cause of this?&amp;quot; Such language implies that there is one cause, when instead there were probably a large number of contributing factors. However, having produced a list of several contributing factors, it may be worthwhile to look for the strongest of the factors, or a single cause underlying several of them. A need for simplification may be perceived in order to make the explanation of the tragedy operational, so that responsible authorities can be seen to have taken action.

For instance, after a [[school shooting]], editorialists debate whether it was caused by the shooter&amp;apos;s parents, [[media violence research|violence in media]], stress on students, or the accessibility of guns. In fact, many different causes—including some of those—may all have necessarily contributed. Similarly, the music industry might claim that [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] is the cause of a loss in profit whereas factors such as a growing videogame market and economic depression are also likely to be major factors.

Causal oversimplification is a specific kind of [[false dilemma]] where conjoint possibilities are ignored. In other words, the possible causes are assumed to be &amp;quot;A or B or C&amp;quot; when &amp;quot;A and B and C&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;A and B and not C&amp;quot; (etc.) are not taken into consideration.

A notable scientific example of what can happen when this kind of fallacy is identified and resolved is the development in economics of the [[Coase theorem]].
