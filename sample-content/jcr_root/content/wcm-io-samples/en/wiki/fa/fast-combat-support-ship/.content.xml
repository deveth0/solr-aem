The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;fast combat support ship&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[US Navy hull classification symbol]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AOE&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is the [[United States Navy]]&amp;apos;s largest [[combat logistics ship]], designed as an [[Oiler (ship)|oiler]], [[Ammunition ship|ammunition and supply ship]]. All fast combat support ships currently in service are operated by [[Military Sealift Command]].  The AOE has the speed to keep up with [[carrier battle group]]s and the capacity to fully support their needs. It receives petroleum products, ammunition and stores from various shuttle ships and redistributes these items when needed to ships in the carrier battle group . This greatly reduces the number of service ships needed to travel with carrier battle groups.

The four ships of the {{sclass|Sacramento|fast combat support ship|4}} were 53,000 tons at full load, 796 feet overall length, and carried two [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight]] helicopters. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sacramento&amp;apos;&amp;apos; class was retired in 2005.

The {{sclass|Supply|fast combat support ship|4}} ships displace 48,800 tons full load and operate two Sikorsky [[MH-60S Knighthawk]] helicopters.
