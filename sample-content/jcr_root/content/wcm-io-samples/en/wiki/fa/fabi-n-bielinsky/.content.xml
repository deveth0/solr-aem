&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fabián Bielinsky&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (3 February 1959 – 29 June 2006) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[film director]] born in [[Buenos Aires]].

He started to make films early in his life, while still a high school student in the [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires]], after graduation he started studying psychology, a career he shortly followed and dropped out in favor to enroll in the Centro de Experimentacion y Realizacion Cinematografica (CERC, actually [[ENERC]], [[INCAA]]&amp;apos;s film school), to later graduate from said institution in 1983 with a short film called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[La Espera]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, based in a story by [[Jorge Luis Borges]].

He directed his first film, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[9 Queens (film)|Nine Queens]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (original title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Nueve Reinas]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) in [[2000 in film|2000]], and the second one, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[El Aura]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in [[2005 in film|2005]], which he was going to present in Edinburgh, at the International Film Festival a month later. Both films starred [[Ricardo Darín]] in the lead role and [[Alejandro Awada]] in a supporting role.

Bielinsky died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], in 2006, at only 47 years of age, while he was in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], doing a [[casting (performing arts)|casting]] for an advertisement.

Although he directed only one short and two feature films, his work was shown worldwide to excellent reviews. His work is more appreciated in his country of origin for finding a way to make an entertaining yet thoughtful story that grips the viewer in an industry where film offerings are more polarized between overtly intellectual [[auteur]] cinema and apparently content-lacking commercial films.
