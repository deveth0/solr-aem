        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fadi Ihsan Fadel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1971) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[humanitarian]] worker who was taken [[hostage]] in [[Iraq]]. He was taken hostage on April 7, 2004 and released April 16, 2004. He was working for [[New York]]-based [[International Rescue Committee]], a [[Non-governmental organization|non-government organization]]. The key issue to his release was the emphasis to his captors that he was Canadian, not [[Israelis|Israeli]].

Fadel believes that his captors specifically targeted him as they called him by his name.
