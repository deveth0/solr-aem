&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fatal Microbes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were a [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[punk rock|punk]] group that existed in the late 1970s. [[Honey Bane]] (Donna Tracey Boylan) was the lead singer. Other band members were Gem Stone (Gemma Sansom) on drums, Pete Fender (Dan Sansom) on guitar, and Scotty Boy Barker (Scott Barker) who was briefly replaced as bassist by It (Quentin North).

In 1979, Small Wonder and XNTRIX Records co-released a split [[12&amp;quot;]] [[Extended play|EP]] entitled &amp;quot;Violence Grows&amp;quot;, which also featured the (at that time) [[Epping]] based [[Poison Girls]] (whose singer, [[Vi Subversa]], was also mother to Gem Stone and Pete Fender). Due to the popularity of Fatal Microbes, [[Small Wonder Records]] released a 7&amp;quot; single featuring &amp;quot;Violence Grows&amp;quot;, which was hailed as a classic by [[John Peel]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Honey Bane later had a career as a solo artist, a film and stage actress, and a model. Pete Fender subsequently went on to form [[Rubella Ballet]] with Gem Stone (bass) and Sid Ation (drums) who was later also in [[Flux of Pink Indians]]. Fender later released a 7&amp;quot; EP, &amp;quot;Four Formulas&amp;quot;, under his own name on XNTRIX records. Fender and It had originally met when they formed the band Punktuation in 1977. With an average age of 13 years, they were amongst the youngest punk bands in the country at the time.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.box.com/shared/ar6ot58kdh#/s/ar6ot58kdh/1/34918264/360429592/1&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Later, Fender was also a member of [[Omega Tribe]].
