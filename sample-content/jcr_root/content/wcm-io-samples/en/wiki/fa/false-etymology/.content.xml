        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;false etymology&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;pseudoetymology&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;paraetymology&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;paretymology&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), sometimes called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;folk etymology&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; although this is also [[folk etymology|a technical term in linguistics]], is a [[wikt:specious#Adjective|specious]] ([[wikt:plausible#Adjective|plausible]] but false) belief about the origins of specific words, often originating in &amp;quot;common-sense&amp;quot; assumptions. Because of their specious &amp;quot;obviousness&amp;quot;, many are widely held.

Such [[etymology|etymologies]] often have the feel of [[urban legend]]s, and can be much more colorful than the typical etymologies found in dictionaries, often involving stories of unusual practices in particular subcultures (e.g. Oxford students from non-noble families being supposedly forced to write &amp;apos;&amp;apos;sine nobilitate&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by their name, soon abbreviated to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;s.nob.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, hence the word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wikt:snob|snob]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/22147/etymology-of-snob&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://oxforddictionaries.com/words/what-is-the-origin-of-the-word-snob&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Many recent examples are &amp;quot;backronyms&amp;quot; ([[acronym]]s made up to explain a term), as in &amp;quot;snob&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;posh&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;port outward, starboard homeward&amp;quot;; many other sourced examples are listed in the article on [[backronym]]s.

==Source and influence of false etymologies==
Erroneous etymologies can exist for many reasons.  Some are reasonable interpretations of the evidence that happen to be false.  For a given word there may often have been many serious attempts by scholars to propose etymologies based on the best information available at the time, and these can be later modified or rejected as linguistic scholarship advances.  The results of [[medieval etymology]], for example, were plausible given the insights available at the time, but have mostly{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} been rejected by modern linguists.  The etymologies of [[Humanism|humanist]] scholars in the early modern period began to produce more reliable results, but many of their hypotheses have been superseded.  Even today, knowledge in the field advances so rapidly that many of the etymologies in contemporary dictionaries are outdated.

== Association with urban legends ==
Some etymologies are part of [[urban legend]]s, and seem to respond to a general taste for the surprising, counterintuitive and even scandalous. One common example has to do with the phrase &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[rule of thumb]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, meaning a rough measurement. An urban legend has it that the phrase refers to an old English law under which a man could legally beat his wife with a stick no thicker than his thumb (though no such law ever existed).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.quinion.com/words/qa/qa-rul1.htm World Wide Words etymology of &amp;quot;rule of thumb&amp;quot;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the [[United States]], many of these scandalous legends have had to do with [[racism]] and [[slavery]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}. Common words such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;picnic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.snopes.com/language/offense/picnic.htm Urban Legends reference pages on supposed etymology of picnic]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;buck&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.snopes.com/language/offense/buck.htm Urban Legends reference pages on supposed etymology of buck]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;crowbar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.snopes.com/language/offense/crowbar.asp Urban Legends reference pages on supposed origin of crowbar]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; have been alleged to stem from derogatory terms or racist practices. The &amp;quot;discovery&amp;quot; of these alleged etymologies is often believed by those who circulate them to draw attention to racist attitudes embedded in ordinary discourse. On one occasion, the use of the word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Controversies about the word &amp;quot;niggardly&amp;quot;|niggardly]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; led to the resignation of a U.S. public official because it sounded similar to the word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[nigger]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, despite the two words being unrelated etymologically.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mniggard.html Article on the etymology of the word niggardly]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
