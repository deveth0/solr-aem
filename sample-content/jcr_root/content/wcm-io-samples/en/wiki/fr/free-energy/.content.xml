        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Free energy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; may refer to:

In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;economics&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:
* Energy from sources that do not require an input which has to be paid for, (usually a sub-set of [[renewable energy]])
In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;science&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:
* [[Thermodynamic free energy]], the energy in a physical system that can be converted to do work, in particular:
** [[Helmholtz free energy]], the energy that can be converted into work at a constant temperature and volume
**[[Work content]], a related concept used in chemistry
** [[Gibbs free energy]], the energy that can be converted into work at a uniform temperature and pressure throughout a system
* Variational free energy, a construct from information theory that is used in [[Variational Bayesian methods]]
In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;pseudoscience&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:
* Free energy device
** a hypothetical [[perpetual motion]] device that creates energy, thereby contradicting the laws of thermodynamics
** a device of which a controversial claim is made that it taps an unconventional energy source not regarded as viable by the scientific community at large
In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;popular culture&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:
*[[Free energy suppression]], a conspiracy theory that advanced energy technologies are being suppressed by [[governments]] and/or [[Advocacy group|special interest groups]]
In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;music&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:
*[[Free Energy (band)]], a 5-piece rock band on DFA Records

*[[Free-energy relationship]] - a relation between the reaction rate or equilibrium constants of two series of chemical reactions
*[[Free energy perturbation]] - a method based on statistical mechanics that is used in computational chemistry for computing free energy differences
*[[Free energy principle]] - a variational formulation of self-organisation in biological systems, applied in particular to neuroscience
