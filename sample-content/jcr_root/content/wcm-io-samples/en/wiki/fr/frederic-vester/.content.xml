&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Frederic Vester&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (November 23, 1925 – November 2, 2003) was a [[Germany|German]] [[biochemistry|biochemist]], and an expert in the field of [[ecology]].

== Biography ==
Vester was born in [[Saarbrücken]], and studied [[chemistry]] at the universities of [[University of Mainz|Mainz]], [[University of Paris|Paris]] and [[University of Hamburg|Hamburg]]. From 1955 to 1957 he was postdoctoral fellow at [[Yale University]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. From 1957 to 1966 he worked at [[Saarland University]], [[Saarbrücken]], and from 1969 he worked in [[Munich]], first at the [[Max Planck Institute]]. In 1970 he founded the private Munich-based &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Frederic Vester Studiengruppe für Biologie und Umwelt GmbH&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Frederic Vester Study Group for Biology and Environment, Ltd.), renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Frederic Vester GmbH&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Frederic Vester, Ltd.&amp;quot;) after his death.

From 1982 to 1989 he was a [[professor]] at the [[Bundeswehr University Munich]], and from 1989 to 1991 he was Professor for [[Applied economics|Applied Economics]] at the [[University of St. Gallen|Hochschule St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]]. Vester&amp;apos;s ideas influenced the formation of the [[environmental movement]] and the [[Bündnis 90/Die Grünen|Green Party]] in Germany. He was a member of the [[Club of Rome]]. He was married to Anne Vester. The couple had three children and six grandchildren. He died in Munich.

== Work ==
=== Networked Thinking ===
Vester was known as pioneer of networked thinking, a combination of [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] and [[system]]ic ideas and [[complexity]]. Central ideas of network thinking include viewing a system as a network of interrelated effects, leading to [[emergence|emergent]] behavior of the system as a whole. These networks can be described by using protocols, mathematical networks, computer software, so that even someone with the most basic understanding of networks will see relations, including positive and negative [[feedback loop]]s. [[Simulation]]s of systemic networks can help to decide the [[long-term]] effects of [[singular measure]]s.

=== The Sensitivity Model ===
Vester&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sensitivity Model&amp;apos;&amp;apos; combines these ideas, and has been used since the 1980s in studies by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[UNESCO]] and other organizations.

== Publications ==
