&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Frankenchrist&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the third album released by the American [[hardcore punk]] band [[Dead Kennedys]] in 1985 on [[Alternative Tentacles]].

The album is an example of the progressive, psychedelic side of the Kennedys&amp;apos; musical personality. The [[Spaghetti Western|spaghetti western]] soundtrack influence is also noticeable in the horn parts and  in [[East Bay Ray]]&amp;apos;s atmospheric guitar work. Frankenchrist is noted for its relative lack of traditionally &amp;apos;[[Hardcore_punk|hardcore]]&amp;apos; material.  Most of the songs are slower and longer than the majority of other Dead Kennedys songs. &amp;quot;M.T.V. − Get off the Air&amp;quot; is notable for its pointed slam of the music establishment and &amp;quot;Stars and Stripes of Corruption&amp;quot; for its exegesis of Biafra&amp;apos;s political philosophies.

==Controversy==
The album was a subject of controversy because of a poster inserted in the original record sleeve. The poster, [[H. R. Giger]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Landscape #XX&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or [[Penis Landscape]], was a painting depicting rows of penises and vulvae. The band&amp;apos;s vocalist was brought to trial for distributing harmful matter to minors, and though the case did not result in a conviction, [[Jello Biafra]]&amp;apos;s [[Alternative Tentacles]] was driven almost to bankruptcy.

Only through the support of fans was the label able to stay alive. Biafra gained attention as a champion of free speech, and was subsequently one of the most active opponents of the [[Parents Music Resource Center]]. The cover itself depicts a [[Shriner]]s parade.
