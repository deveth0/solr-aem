The [[French Quarter]] neighborhood of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] is the center of the city&amp;apos;s [[Carnival]] celebrations, especially on [[Mardi Gras]] Day.  This part of town is crowded with both [[tourism|tourists]] and locals, with the former more numerous in the Upper Quarter, the latter in the Lower Quarter.  There are numerous parties and more than one [[costume]] contest.  While the large motorized floats of the big parades have been prohibited since the early 1970s from going down the Quarter&amp;apos;s narrow streets, numerous small marching [[krewe]]s, parading [[jazz]] bands, and groups of revelers converge here.  Some krewes parade in the Quarter after starting earlier in the day in other parts of town.
