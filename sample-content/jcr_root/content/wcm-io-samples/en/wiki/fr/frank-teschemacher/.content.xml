        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Frank Teschemacher&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (March 13, 1906 in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]] &amp;amp;ndash; March 1, 1932 in [[Chicago]]) was an American [[jazz]] [[clarinetist]] and alto-[[saxophonist]], associated with the [[Austin High School Gang|&amp;quot;Austin High&amp;quot; gang]] (along with [[Jimmy McPartland]], [[Bud Freeman]] and others). He was born in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], but spent most of his career based in [[Chicago, Illinois]], although gigs sometimes took him to [[New York City]], around the [[U.S. Midwest]], and he also took a job in [[Florida]] with [[Charlie Straight]].

Strongly influenced by cornetist Bix Beiderbecke, he was mainly self-taught on his instruments; early on he also doubled on [[violin]] and [[banjo]]. He started playing the [[clarinet]] professionally in 1925. He began recording under his own name in 1928 and made what are believed to be his final recordings two years later, although there is now reason to believe (via sine wave recording research, aka Smith/Westbrook Method) that he appeared on unidentified recordings as late as 1930. His intense solo work laid the groundwork for a rich sound and creative approach, that is credited with influencing a young Benny Goodman and a style of which [[Pee Wee Russell]] is perhaps the best-known representative. He also made recordings on the [[saxophone]]. Late in his career, he returned to playing violin with [[Jan Garber]]&amp;apos;s sweet dance orchestra, trying to earn a living in the midst of the [[Great Depression]]. Although he was well known in the world of jazz, he did not live to enjoy popular success in the [[swing music|swing]] era. He was killed in an automobile accident on the morning of March 1, 1932, a passenger in a car driven by his performing associate cornetist [[Wild Bill Davison|&amp;quot;Wild&amp;quot; Bill Davison]]; it was several days short of what would have been his 26th birthday.
