&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fred Foster&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fred Luther Foster&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, July 26, 1931, [[Rutherford County, North Carolina|Rutherford County]], [[North Carolina]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[songwriter]], [[record producer]], and founder of [[Monument Records]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Unterberger&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p77128/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Fred Foster|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=22 July 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Biography==
Born in North Carolina, Foster struggled to support his mother after the death of his father. At the age of seventeen, Foster left the farm and moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], where he would eventually work for [[Mercury Records]] and [[ABC-Paramount Records]] (1955).

In March 1958, Foster used his life savings and formed the Monument Records with minority partner, Buddy Deane (a [[disc jockey]] at [[WITH (FM)|WITH]]). In 1959, Deane sold his stock back to Foster, and Foster re-located the label to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1960.  Foster remained active with the label until 1983. Foster is credited with the development of [[Roy Orbison]]&amp;apos;s career, producing many of Orbison&amp;apos;s major hits, including: &amp;quot;[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;[[Only the Lonely]]&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;[[Running Scared (song)|Running Scared]]&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;[[In Dreams (song)|In Dreams]]&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;[[It&amp;apos;s Over (Roy Orbison song)|It&amp;apos;s Over]]&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;[[Mean Woman Blues]]&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;[[Candy Man (Roy Orbison song)|Candy Man]]&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;[[Blue Bayou]]&amp;quot;.  Foster also played a significant role in [[Dolly Parton]]&amp;apos;s early career, signing her to Monument in 1964, shortly after her arrival in Nashville, and overseeing her recordings, culminating with her first top 40 country hit &amp;quot;[[Hello, I&amp;apos;m Dolly|Dumb Blonde]]&amp;quot; in 1967. Foster also produced [[Billy Grammer]], [[Ray Stevens]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Tony Joe White]], [[Larry Gatlin]], [[Charlie McCoy]], [[Al Hirt]], [[Boots Randolph]], [[Jerry Byrd]], [[Billy Joe Shaver]], [[Grandpa Jones]], [[The Velvets]] and [[Robert Mitchum]].

In 1963, Foster expanded his label, forming the [[soul music|soul]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;amp;B]] imprint called [[Sound Stage 7]]. Its roster of artists included [[Joe Simon (musician)|Joe Simon]], [[The Dixie Belles]], [[Arthur Alexander]], and [[Ivory Joe Hunter]]. Foster co-wrote (with [[Kris Kristofferson]]) &amp;quot;[[Me and Bobby McGee]]&amp;quot;, which was a hit for Kristofferson, plus [[Bobbie Gentry]] and [[Janis Joplin]].

More recently, Foster produced [[Willie Nelson]]&amp;apos;s 2006 [[Grammy Award]] nominated &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[You Don&amp;apos;t Know Me: The Songs of Cindy Walker]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and Nelson&amp;apos;s collaboration with [[Merle Haggard]] and [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Last of the Breed (album)|Last of the Breed]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2007). The latter was the winner of 2008 Grammy for Best Country Collaboration for the track, &amp;quot;Lost Highway&amp;quot;.

Foster was inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] on October 12, 2009. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1623747/rascal-flatts-perform-with-toto-during-musicians-hall-of-fame-induction-ceremony.jhtml&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He will be inducted into the [[North Carolina Music Hall of Fame]] on October 11, 2012.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=N.C.
