&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Frans Snyders&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Snijders&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (11 November 1579 &amp;amp;ndash; 19 August 1657) was a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[Painting|painter]] of [[animal]]s and [[still life]].

Snyders was born and died at [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]].  He is recorded as a student of [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]] in 1593, and subsequently received instruction from [[Hendrick van Balen]], the first master of [[Van Dyck]].  He was a friend of Van Dyck who painted Snyders and his wife more than once ([[Frick Collection]], [[Kassel]] etc.).

He became a master of the Antwerp [[painters guild]] in 1602. He visited [[Italy]] in 1608-9, visiting Rome, and working for [[Federico Borromeo|Cardinal Borromeo]] in [[Milan]].  In 1611 he married Margaretha, the sister of [[Cornelis de Vos]] and [[Paul de Vos]] (another animal painter), in Antwerp. [[Jan Fyt]] was a student, and then assistant of his from 1629.

Snyders initially devoted himself to painting flowers, fruit and subjects of still life, but later turned to painting animals, and executed with the greatest skill and spirit hunting pieces and combats of wild animals. He was one of the earliest specialist &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[animalier]]s&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

His composition is rich and varied, his drawing correct and vigorous, his touch bold and thoroughly expressive of the different textures of furs and skins.  His excellence in this department excited the admiration of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], who frequently employed him to paint animals, fruit and still life in his own pictures, and he assisted [[Jacob Jordaens]], [[Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert]] and other artists in a similar manner.

In the lion and boar hunts which bear the name of Snyders the hand of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] sometimes appears.  He was one of the executors of Rubens&amp;apos;s will.

He was appointed principal painter to the [[Archduke Albert of Austria (1559-1621)|Archduke Albert of Austria]], governor of the [[Low Countries]], for whom he executed some of his finest works. One of these, a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stag-Hunt&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was presented to [[Philip III of Spain]], who together with his successor [[Philip IV of Spain]], commissioned the artist to paint several subjects of the chase, which are still preserved in [[Spain]].  He also worked for [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]], when he became Governor.

According to the RKD he had many followers; his registered pupils were [[Nicasius Bernaerts]], Peter van Boucle, [[Joannes Fijt]], [[Juriaen Jacobsze]], Jan Roos (I), and [[Paul de Vos]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.rkd.nl/rkddb/dispatcher.aspx?action=search&amp;amp;database=ChoiceArtists&amp;amp;search=priref=73723 Frans Snijders] in the [[RKD]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
