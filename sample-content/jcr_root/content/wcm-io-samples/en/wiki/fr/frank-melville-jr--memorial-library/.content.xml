The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Frank Melville Jr. Memorial Library&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the main library at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]]. It is named for the father of [[philanthropist]] [[Ward Melville]]. Originally constructed in 1962 as a modest sized three-story building, it was renovated almost immediately and greatly expanded and re-[[dedication|dedicated]] in 1967. It holds more than 2.1 million bound volumes and over four million rolls of microfilm. The library is a member of the [[Association of Research Libraries]], a consortium of the top 120 research libraries in the country. The library has a Special Collections Department which houses over 16,000 rare books, 800 antique and hand-drawn maps, and over 150 collections, including the papers of Senator [[Jacob K. Javits]], the Environmental Defense Archive, and the [[William Butler Yeats]] Microfilmed Manuscripts Collection.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.stonybrook.edu/library/about/welcome/fastfacts.html{{dead link|date=March 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The building consists of six floors, and a commuter lounge, and is located on the Academic Mall of the university. There are also separate branch libraries in Math, Physics &amp;amp; Astronomy, Chemistry, Music, Computer Science, and Marine Science. The Library also contains offices for different academic departments, as well as classrooms, computer labs, a career center and a bookstore.
