        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fred Asher Rosenstock&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1895&amp;amp;ndash;1986; born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Selig Usher Rosenstock&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1895 in Biala Potok in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], then a province of [[Austria]] in the foothills of the [[Carpathian Mountains]]) was a prominent [[book selling|bookseller]], [[book]] and [[art]]  [[collectible|collector]] and [[publishing|publisher]] in [[Denver, Colorado]] from the 1920s through the 1970s. His family [[emigration|emigrated]] to [[United States|America]] in 1904. The family lived in [[Rochester, New York]].

During [[World War I]] Fred moved to [[Washington, DC]] and worked both as a civilian and later in the [[United States Army|US Army]] as a [[secretary|stenographer]]. After the war he worked for a [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] company, but became ill. He was advised to move to a dry, desert climate such as California. He went west but never got past Denver.

Fred had been interested in books from his youth, and by the time he was in Washington was a collector haunting the book shops and building a small collection. In Denver he continued collecting and in 1922 opened his first bookstore, the Denver Book Shop, an [[antiquarian books|antiquarian book store]]. It was not a success. Later after marrying Frances Goodman in 1928 he purchased an existing book store in a good location on 15th Street in Denver and renamed it the Bargain Book Store. He continued to collect and sell rare books but the main business of the Bargain Book Store was selling school textbooks. This line got the business through the [[great depression]]. The store burned in 1948 and was rebuilt.

Meanwhile Fred continued his interest in rare books developing an interest in western history. By 1960 he began liquidating his general book business and in 1962 opened Fred A. Rosenstock Books on East [[Colfax Avenue]] in Denver specializing in western history. Fred had also developed an interest in western art and had collected many of the [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s of [[Charles Marion Russell]] which he displayed in his bookstore.

Fred Rosenstock became recognized as the leading bookseller in the field of western history and located and sold many books to the important western history collections, notably to the [[library]] at [[Brigham Young University]] and the Denver Public Library.

He was also a [[publishing|publisher]] operating as the Old West Publishing Company, issuing about 30 significant books.

By the 1970s Fred was still active, but ready to reduce his activities. His extensive art collection was sold at auction (with disappointing results) and he closed his magnificent bookstore.
