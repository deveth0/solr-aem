        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Francisco de Bobadilla&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[colony|colonial]] administrator. Member of the [[Order of Calatrava]], in 1499, de Bobadilla was appointed to succeed [[Christopher Columbus]] as the second [[governor]] of the Indies, [[Spain]]&amp;apos;s new territories in [[Americas|America]], by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]]. Upon his arrival at [[Santo Domingo]], [[Hispaniola]] in August 1500, de Bobadilla upheld accusations of mismanagement made against Columbus, and had Columbus sent back to Spain in chains.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Citation |title=Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus |year=1942 |last=Morison |first=Samuel Eliot |publisher=Little, Brown and Co. |location=Boston |page=571 }}.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1502, he was replaced as governor of Hispaniola by [[Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres]].

He died {{OldStyleDate|July 11|1502|July 1}} during a [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|hurricane]] that wrecked 20 vessels of the 31-ship convoy, including the flagship, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;El Dorado&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in the [[Mona Passage]] returning to Spain. Among the surviving ships was the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aguja&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the weakest ship of the convoy and which carried the gold Columbus was owed—spurring accusations that Columbus magically invoked the storm out of vengeance.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Morison, Samuel Eliot (1942), p. 590.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
