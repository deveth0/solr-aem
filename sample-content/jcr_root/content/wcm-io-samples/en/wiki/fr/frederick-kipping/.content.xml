Professor &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Frederick Stanley Kipping&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Royal Society|FRS]]&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;frs&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1950.0013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; (16 Aug 1863 - 1 May 1949) was an [[English people|English]] [[chemist]].

He was born in [[Manchester]], [[England]], the son of James Kipping, a Bank of England official, and educated at [[Manchester Grammar School]] before enrolling in 1879 at Owens College (now Manchester University) for an external degree from the [[University of London]]. After working for the local gas company for a short time he went in 1886 to [[Germany]] to work under [[William Henry Perkin, Jr.]] in the laboratories of [[Adolf von Baeyer]] at [[Munich University]].

Back in England, he took a position as demonstrator for Perkin, who had been appointed professor at [[Heriot-Watt University|Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh]]. In 1890, Kipping was appointed chief demonstrator in chemistry for the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]], where he worked for the chemist [[Henry Edward Armstrong]]. In 1897 he moved to [[Nottingham University|University College, Nottingham]] as professor of the chemistry department, and became the first newly endowed Sir [[Jesse Boot]] professor of chemistry at the university in 1928. He remained there until his retirement in 1936.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/34335}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Kipping undertook much of the pioneering work into the development of [[silicon]] [[polymers]] ([[silicone]]s) at  Nottingham. He pioneered the study of the [[organic compounds]] of silicon ([[organosilicon]]) and coined the term [[silicone]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0VJD6MzH9D8C&amp;amp;pg=PT27|page=27|title=Handbook of Sealant Technology|author=K.L. Mittal, A. Pizzi|publisher=CRC Press|year=2009|isbn=0-8493-9162-8}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;   His research formed the basis for the worldwide development of the synthetic [[rubber]] and silicone-based [[lubricant]] industries.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Asimov, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Asimov&amp;apos;s Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 2nd Revised edition&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  He also co-wrote, with Perkin, a standard textbook in organic chemistry (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Organic Chemistry&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Perkin and Kipping, 1899).

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in June, 1897.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;frs&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;amp;dsqPos=0&amp;amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27kipping%27%29 | title = Library and Archive catalogue|accessdate= 8 November 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was awarded their [[Davy Medal]] in 1918 and delivered their [[Bakerian Lecture]] in 1936.

He retired in 1936 and died in Criccieth, Wales. He had married in 1888 Lilian Holland, one of three sisters. Both his brothers-in-law were eminent scientists themselves ([[Arthur Lapworth]] and [[William Henry Perkin, Jr.]])
