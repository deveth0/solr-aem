&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Frank Heino Damrosch&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (June 22, 1859 – October 22, 1937) was a German-born American music conductor and educator.

==Life and career==
Damrosch was born on June 22, 1859 in [[Breslau]], the son of Helene von Heimburg, a former opera singer, and conductor [[Leopold Damrosch]]. He came to the United States with his father, brother, conductor [[Walter Damrosch]], and sister, music teacher [[Clara Mannes]], in 1871. His parents were Lutheran (his paternal grandfather was Jewish).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=fbQiAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;q=Helene+von+Heimburg++lutheran&amp;amp;dq=Helene+von+Heimburg++lutheran&amp;amp;hl=en]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=4fgJawIYjHwC&amp;amp;pg=PR9&amp;amp;dq=Leopold+Damrosch+lutheran&amp;amp;hl=en]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=rVLOhGt1BX0C&amp;amp;pg=RA1-PA490&amp;amp;dq=%22pianist+and+music+educator,+was+born+in+Breslau%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;redir_esc=y]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He had studied music in Germany under [[Dionys Pruckner]]. He studied in New York under [[Ferdinand von Inten]]. He also studied in Europe under [[Moritz Moszkowski]].

He originally intended to adopt a business career, and to that end went to [[Denver, Colorado]], but the musical impulse proved too strong, and in 1884 he was an organist, conductor of the [[Denver Chorus Club]], and supervisor of music in the [[Public education|public schools]].

For some years he was chorus master at the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]] in New York. He also conducted the [[Mendelssohn Glee Club]] from 1885 to 1887. In 1892 he organized the People&amp;apos;s Singing Classes, and he was also instrumental in founding the [[Musical Art Society of New York]].

In 1897 he became supervisor of music in the public schools in New York.

In 1898 Damrosch succeeded his brother [[Walter Johannes Damrosch|Walter]] as conductor of the [[Oratorio Society of New York|Oratorio Society]], which he directed until 1912.  Damrosch Park, part of New York&amp;apos;s [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]], is named in honor of the Damrosch family.

In 1905 he founded and became director of the [[New York Institute of Musical Art]].  One of Damrosch&amp;apos;s pupils was [[William Howland (musician)|William Howland]], who was head of the music department at the [[University of Michigan]] for many years. In 1926, the Institute of Musical Art merged with the Juilliard Graduate School to form what is today [[Juilliard School]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.juilliard.edu/about/history.php&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Damrosch died in New York City on October 22, 1937.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Founder of Musical Institute and Brother of Walter Is Heart Stroke Victim |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F3061FFD3959177A93C1AB178BD95F438385F9 |quote=Frank Heino Damrosch, founder of the Institute of Musical Art, a member of a great family of musicians and a man who did much for the spread of musical learning in New York, died early yesterday afternoon of a heart attack at his home, 120 East Seventy-fifth Street.
