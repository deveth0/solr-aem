[[Image:François Nicolas Leonard Buzot (1760-1794), French Revolutionary leader.jpg|thumb|François Buzot]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;François Nicolas Léonard Buzot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1 March 1760 &amp;amp;ndash; 18 June 1794) was a French politician and leader of the [[French Revolution]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born at [[Évreux]], [[Eure]], he studied [[Law]], and, at the outbreak of the Revolution was a [[lawyer]] in his home town. In 1789 he was elected deputy to the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] and there became known for his radical opinions. He demanded the [[nationalization]] of the possessions of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and the [[Right to arms|right of all citizens to bear arms]].

After the dissolution of the [[National Constituent Assembly]], Buzot returned to Évreux, where he was named president of the criminal tribunal.

===Convention===
In 1792 he was elected deputy to the [[National Convention]], and joined the [[Girondist]]s under the influence of his friend [[Madame Roland]]. Buzot entered a polemic with the main rival of the Girondists, [[Jean-Paul Marat]], and demanded the formation of a [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] from the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Département in France|départements]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to defend the Convention against the Paris crowds of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[sans-culotte]]s&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. His proposal was carried, but never put into force - the Parisians subsequently singled him out as a target of their hatred.

In the trial of [[List of French monarchs|King]] [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], Buzot voted in favour of the [[capital punishment]] death, but with [[Appeal|appeal to the people]] and postponement of sentence (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;sursis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). He had a sentence of death passed against the [[House of Bourbon|Royalist]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[émigré]]s&amp;apos;&amp;apos; who did not return to France, and against anyone who should demand the re-establishment of the monarchy. At the same time, he opposed [[Georges Danton]] and [[The Mountain]], and rejected the creation of a [[Committee of Public Safety]] and [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] (but [[Abstention|abstained]] when the question of Marat&amp;apos;s trial before the Tribunal was brought up by the Girondists).

===Flight and resistance===
Proscribed with the Girondists on 2 June 1793, he escaped, and took refuge to [[Calvados]] in [[Normandy]], where he contributed to organize a Girondist [[insurrection]] against the Convention, which was suppressed soon after.

The Convention prosecuted him, and decreed &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;that the house occupied by Buzot be demolished, and never to be rebuilt on this plot. [Instead,] a [[column]] shall be raised, on which there shall be written: «Here was the sanctuary of the villain Buzot who, while a representative of the people, [[Conspiracy (political)|conspired]] for the overthrow of the [[First French Republic|French Republic]]»&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;. He fled together with [[Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve]] to [[Saint-Émilion]], near [[Bordeaux]], and remained in hiding. Both of them committed [[suicide]] in the forest surrounding the area; their bodies were recovered a month later, half-eaten by wolves.

He left behind his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Memoirs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, first published in 1823.
