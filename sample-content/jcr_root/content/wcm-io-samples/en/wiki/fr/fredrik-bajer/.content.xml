&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fredrik Bajer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 21, 1837 – January 22, 1922) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] writer, teacher, and [[pacifism|pacifist]] [[politician]] who received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1908.

The son of a clergyman, Bajer served as an officer in the Danish army, fighting in the 1864 war against [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]] where he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. He was discharged in 1865, and moved to Copenhagen where he became a teacher, translator and writer.

He entered the [[Rigsdag|Danish Parliament]] in 1872 as a member of [[Parliament of Denmark|Folketinget]] and held a seat there for the following 23 years. As a member of parliament, he worked for the use of international arbitration to solve conflicts among nations, and it is due to Bajer&amp;apos;s efforts that foreign relations became part of the work of the Danish Parliament and that Denmark participated in the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] from the beginning and earned a distinguished position among its members.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Skou, Kaare R.

He supported many peace organizations, both inside Denmark and Europe-wide, and helped guide the passage of a bill to reach arbitration agreements with [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]].
