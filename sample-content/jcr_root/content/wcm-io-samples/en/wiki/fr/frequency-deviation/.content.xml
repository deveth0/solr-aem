        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Frequency deviation (Δf)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is used in [[Frequency modulation|FM radio]] to describe the maximum instantaneous difference between an FM modulated frequency and the [[Center frequency|nominal carrier frequency]]. The term is sometimes mistakenly used as synonymous with [[frequency drift]], which is an unintended offset of an oscillator from its nominal frequency.

The frequency deviation of a radio is of particular importance in relation to [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], because less deviation means that more channels can fit into the same amount of [[frequency spectrum]]. The [[FM broadcasting]] range (87.5–108 MHZ, NOTE: In some countries the 87.5-88.0 MHZ part of the band is not used) uses a channel spacing of 200 kHz, with a maximum frequency deviation of 75 kHz, leaving a 25 kHz buffer above the highest and below the lowest frequency to reduce interaction with other channels.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/audio/radio.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[AM broadcasting]] uses a channel spacing of 10 kHz, but with [[amplitude modulation]] frequency deviation is irrelevant.

FM applications use peak deviations of 75 kHz (200 kHz spacing), 5 kHz (25 kHz spacing), 2.25 kHz (12.5 kHz spacing), and 2 kHz (8.33 kHz spacing).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.rsgb-spectrumforum.org.uk/Papers/VHF/Davos%20C5%20Papers/DV05_C5_17%20SARL%20NBFM.pdf&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
