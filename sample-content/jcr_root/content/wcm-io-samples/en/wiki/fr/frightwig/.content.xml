&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Frightwig&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; originated as an all-female Feminist Punk Rock American band from [[San Francisco]], California. Deanna Ashley and Mia Levin formed Frightwig in 1982. After many years and many line-up changes, 1994 saw Frightwig retire from the stage to raise their children and focus on other career paths.

Frightwig came out from a long hibernation in 2012 and started playing together again. The current line-up is Deanna Mitchell, Mia d&amp;apos;Bruzzi, Cecilia Kuhn, Rebecca Sevrin and Eric Dew Feldman. Rachel Thoele performed with Frightwig in the fall of 2012.

==History==
When they first formed in 1982, Frightwig received a lot of attention for being female. Frightwig rose to the occasion and defended their right to be on stage with the men. Frightwig stood up to the catcalls and turned it into a stage show. On &amp;quot;A Man&amp;apos;s Gotta Do, What A Man&amp;apos;s Gotta Do&amp;quot;, Frightwig invited men onto the stage to strip. It was all in good fun, a sexist turnaround.

In San Francisco, Frightwig played at every venue in town, from the [[Valencia Tool &amp;amp; Die]] to [[The Fillmore]]. Frightwig was at home at the [[Mabuhay Gardens]] and eventually upstairs at the On Broadway. Frightwig also played many shows at [[The Farm (San Francisco)|The Farm]].

Frightwig toured coast to coast in the United States for over ten years. They toured British Columbia many times, and toured Europe in the fall of 1985, opening for [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]], and in 1994 for a spring Swiss tour.

Frightwig toured with [[Flipper]],[Funkyard], [[The Butthole Surfers]], D.O.A., [[Snakefinger]], GBH, [[Redd Kross]] and [[Nomeansno|No Means No]]. Frightwig played with [[The Dead Kennedys]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[Lydia Lunch]], [[L7 (band)|L7]], [[SWA (band)|SWA]] and [[Bikini Kill]] to name a few.
