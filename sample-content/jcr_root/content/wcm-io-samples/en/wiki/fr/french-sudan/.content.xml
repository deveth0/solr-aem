&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;French Sudan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-fr|Soudan Français}}) was a colony in [[French West Africa]] that had two separate periods of existence, first from 1890 to 1899, then from 1920 to 1960, when the territory became the independent nation of [[Mali]].

==Colonial establishment==
French Sudan was created as a French territory on 9 September 1880, as &amp;quot;Upper Senegal&amp;quot;, and was renamed the &amp;quot;French Sudan Territory&amp;quot; on 18 August 1890, with its capital at [[Kayes]]. [[Edgard de Trentinian]] was governor from 1895.

On 10 October 1899, French Sudan was broken up; 11 southern provinces went to [[French Guinea]], the [[Côte d&amp;apos;Ivoire]] and [[Dahomey]], although two were returned in the following year.

In 1902 the parts of the colony not organized into military districts became [[Senegambia and Niger]], then [[Upper Senegal and Niger]] in 1904, then the old name came back in a reorganization of 1920.

When the [[French Upper Volta]] was first abolished in 1933 (it was reestablished in 1947), French Sudan gained some of its provinces.

==Independence==
After the French constitutional referendum of 4 October 1958, the &amp;quot;République Soudanaise&amp;quot; became a member of the [[French Community]], once again with the name French Sudan, and gained complete internal autonomy 25 November 1958.

On 4 April 1959, French Sudan was joined with [[Senegal]] to form the [[Mali Federation]], which became fully independent within the French Community on 20 June 1960. The federation collapsed on 20 August 1960, when Senegal seceded. On 22 September, French Soudan proclaimed itself the [[Republic of Mali]] and withdrew from the French Community.
