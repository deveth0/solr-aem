&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the second [[Boroughs of Berlin|borough]] of [[Berlin]], formed in 2001 by merging the former [[East Berlin]] borough of [[Friedrichshain]] and the former [[West Berlin]] borough of [[Kreuzberg]]. The historic [[Oberbaum Bridge]], formerly a [[Berlin border crossings|Berlin border crossing]] for pedestrians, links both districts across the river [[Spree]] as the new borough&amp;apos;s [[landmark]] (as featured in the coat of arms).

==Overview==
[[File:Berlin Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg.svg|thumb|left|Subdivisions of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg]]
The [[counterculture]] tradition especially of Kreuzberg led to a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes for the Green Party, which is unique among all Berlin boroughs. The local [[Member of parliament|MP]] [[Hans-Christian Ströbele]] is the only Green [[politician]] directly elected to the federal [[Bundestag]]. While Kreuzberg is characterised by a high number of immigrants, the share of non-German citizens in Friedrichshain is much lower and the average age is higher. The merger between the distinct quarters is celebrated by an annual anarchic &amp;quot;vegetable fight&amp;quot; on the Oberbaumbrücke. Both parts have to deal with the consequences of [[gentrification]].

==Subdivision==
Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg is divided into 2 localities:
*[[Friedrichshain]];
*[[Kreuzberg]].

==Politics==
