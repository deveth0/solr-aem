&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;François-Alphonse Forel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 2, 1841 - August 7, 1912) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] scientist who pioneered the study of [[lake]]s, and is thus considered the founder of [[limnology]].

Born in [[Morges]] on [[Lake Geneva]], he worked as a professor of [[medicine]] at the [[University of Lausanne]].

But his real love was the lake; his investigations of [[biology]], [[chemistry]], water [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]], and [[sedimentation]], and most importantly their interactions, established the foundation of a new discipline.  In his chief work, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Le Léman]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, published in three volumes between 1892 and 1904, he named his activity &amp;apos;&amp;apos;limnology&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in analogy with [[oceanography]] (&amp;quot;limnography&amp;quot; could have been confused with the [[limnograph]], which measures water level in lakes).

He discovered the phenomenon of [[Density Current|density current]]s in lakes, and explained [[seiche]]s, the rhythmic oscillations observed in enclosed waters.

In collaboration with [[Wilhelm Ule]], developed the [[Forel-Ule scale]], used to evaluate the colour of a body of water. In a totally different field, in cooperation with the Italian seismologist [[Michele Stefano de Rossi]], he developed the [[Rossi-Forel scale]] to describe the intensity of an earthquake.

The [[Institute F.-A. Forel]] of the [[University of Geneva]] is named after Forel.
