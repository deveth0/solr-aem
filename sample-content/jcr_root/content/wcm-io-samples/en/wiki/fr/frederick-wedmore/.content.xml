His family were [[Quaker]]s, and he was educated at a Quaker private school and then in [[Lausanne]] and [[Paris]]. After a short experience of journalism in [[Bristol]] he came to [[London]] in 1868, and began to write for [[The Spectator (1828)|The Spectator]]. His early works included two [[novel]]s, but the best examples of his prose are perhaps to be found in his volumes of short stories, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pastorals of France&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1877), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Renunciations&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1893), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Orgeas and Miradou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1896), reprinted in 1905 as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Dream of Provence&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 1900 he published another novel, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Collapse of the Penitent&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. As early as 1878 he had begun a long connection with the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;London Standard&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as art critic. He began his studies on [[etching]] with a noteworthy paper in [[The Nineteenth Century (periodical)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Nineteenth Century&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] (1877–1878) on the etchings of [[Charles Méryon]]. This was followed by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Four Masters of Etching&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1883), with original etchings by [[Francis Seymour Haden|Sir FS Haden]], [[Jules Jacquemart]], [[James McNeill Whistler|JM Whistler]], and [[Alphonse Legros]]; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Etching in England&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1895); an English edition (1894) of [[François Émile Michel|E Michel]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Rembrandt (book)|Rembrandt]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; and a study and a catalogue of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Whistler&amp;apos;s Etchings&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1886, 2nd edition 1899). His other works include &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Studies in English Art&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2 vols., 1876–1880), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Masters of Genre Painting&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1880), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;English Water Colour&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1902), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Turner and Ruskin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ( 2 vols., 1900).

He was knighted in 1912. He published that year his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Memories&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a book of reminiscences, social and literary. He also published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Painters and Painting&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1913) and a novel, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Brenda Walks On&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1916). He died at [[Sevenoaks]].
