&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Francis Richard Lubbock&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (October 16, 1815 – June 22, 1905) was the [[List of Governors of Texas|ninth Governor of Texas]] and was in office during the [[American Civil War]].  He was the brother of [[Thomas Saltus Lubbock]], for whom [[Lubbock County, Texas]] and the [[Lubbock, Texas|City of Lubbock]] are named.

Born in [[Beaufort, South Carolina]], Lubbock was a businessman in [[South Carolina]] before moving to Texas in 1836.  During the [[Republic of Texas]] period, President [[Sam Houston]] appointed Lubbock to be [[Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts|comptroller]].

In 1857, Lubbock was elected [[lieutenant governor of Texas]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] but failed in his reelection bid in 1859.  Following the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] secession in 1861, Lubbock won the governorship of Texas. During his tenure, he supported Confederate [[conscription]], working to draft all able-bodied men, including resident aliens, into the [[Confederate States Army]].

When Lubbock&amp;apos;s term ended in 1863, he joined the Confederate Army and was appointed to a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]]&amp;apos;s position, serving under Major General [[John B. Magruder]]. By 1864, Lubbock was promoted to [[aide-de-camp]] for [[Jefferson Davis]]. Following the Confederacy&amp;apos;s military collapse Lubbock fled from [[Richmond, Virginia]] with Davis. They were soon caught by Union troops in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He was imprisoned at [[Fort Delaware]] for eight months before being paroled.

On his return to Texas, Lubbock continued to pursue business interests in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] and [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]].  From 1878 to 1891, he served as [[Texas State Treasurer]]. He died in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].
