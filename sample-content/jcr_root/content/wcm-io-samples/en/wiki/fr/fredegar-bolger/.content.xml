&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fredegar &amp;quot;Fatty&amp;quot; Bolger&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[fictional character]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]&amp;apos;s fantasy novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Lord of the Rings]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Profile==
Fredegar was one of the small group of [[Hobbit]]s who knew that [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] had the [[One Ring|Ring]]. &amp;apos;Fatty&amp;apos; was a descendant of Hildibrand Took ([[Third Age|T.A.]] 2849–2934), one of the many sons of the [[List of Hobbits#Gerontius|Old Took]]. He was the son of Odovacar Bolger and Rosamunda Took, part of the [[Bolger family]].

When [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] set out to take the Ring to [[Rivendell]], Fredegar stayed behind in Frodo&amp;apos;s house at [[Crickhollow]] in an attempt to keep up appearances and delay news of their departure, as well as give any message to [[Gandalf]] should he turn up. He was frightened half out of his wits by the arrival of the [[Nazgûl]] but escaped unharmed (although he failed to communicate with Gandalf). Fredegar could have gone with Frodo and his companions into the [[Old Forest]], but was terrified of the stories about it and too in love with the Shire to leave it, even for Frodo. Though Merry tried to persuade him that the Old Forest would be nothing compared to meeting the Ringwraiths, Fatty was adamant, so the other Hobbits went into the forest with only the knowledge of [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] to aid them.

Fatty was born in T.A. 2980. He had a younger sister, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Estella&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (T.A. 2985–?), who married [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]].

During [[Saruman]]&amp;apos;s rule of the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]] he led a group of partisans fighting against the Ruffians around the hills of Scary, before eventually being captured. He was imprisoned and starved, meaning that after his release nobody could call him Fatty any more.

In [[Peter Jackson]]&amp;apos;s film adaptation, the entire subplot of Frodo buying a house in Crickhollow was dropped to both keep Jackson&amp;apos;s portrayal focused and to avoid over-complicating the screenplay.

==Draft notes==
In earlier drafts of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Lord of the Rings&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Fatty Bolger played a much larger role, but this was later abandoned. He does, however, become one of the first and last heroes of the book. He leaves the other four hobbits at the gate to the Old Forest and goes back to Crickhollow to face the wrath of the Black Riders, possibly delaying them by several days by his deception. Then he is one of the last to be rescued from prison, having defied the gangs of Saruman, in the very last chapter of the book.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{ME-ref|RotK|&amp;quot;The Grey Havens&amp;quot;}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
