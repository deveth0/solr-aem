&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;François-Marie de Broglie, 1er duc de Broglie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (11 January 1671 – 22 May 1745)  was a French military leader.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Francois Marie de Broglie was the third son of [[Victor Maurice de Broglie, comte de Broglie]], named for his grandfather, [[François Marie de Broglie, comte de Broglie|François Marie]].  He entered the army at an early age, and had a varied career of active service before he was made, at the age of twenty-three, lieutenant-colonel of the king&amp;apos;s regiment of [[cavalry]].

===Career===
He served continuously in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and was present at [[battle of Malplaquet|Malplaquet]]. He was made lieutenant-general in 1710, and served with [[Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars|Villars]] in the last campaign of the war and at the [[Battle of Denain]]. During the peace he continued in military employment, and in 1719 he was made director-general of cavalry and [[dragoon]]s. He was also employed in [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] missions and was [[ambassador (diplomacy)|ambassador]] in [[England]] in 1724.

The war in [[Italy]] called him into the field again in 1733, and in the following year he was made [[marshal of France]]. In the campaign of 1734 he was one of the chief commanders on the French side, and he fought the Battles of [[Battle of San Pietro|Parma]] and [[battle of Guastalla|Guastalla]]. A famous episode was his narrow personal escape when his quarters on the [[Secchia]]  (battle of Quistello)   were raided by the enemy on the night of 14 September 1734.

In 1735 he directed a war of positions with credit, but he was soon replaced by [[Adrien-Maurice, 3rd duc de Noailles|Marshal de Noailles]]. He was governor-general of [[Alsace]] when [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] paid a secret visit to [[Strasbourg]] in 1740.

In 1742, during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], Broglie was appointed to command the French army in [[Germany]], but the only success obtained was in the action of [[Sahay]] (25 May 1742), for which he was created [[duc de Broglie]] and made a [[peer of France]]. He returned to France in 1743, and died two years later.

===Personal life===
He was the father of [[Victor-François, 2nd duc de Broglie]] and [[Charles-François de Broglie, marquis de Ruffec]].
