&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Francis Longworth Haszard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (November 20, 1849 &amp;amp;ndash; July 25, 1938) was a [[Prince Edward Island]] politician and jurist, the [[List of premiers of Prince Edward Island|tenth]] [[Premier of Prince Edward Island]]. Haszard&amp;apos;s family had been [[United Empire Loyalists]] moving to PEI from the [[United States]] after the [[American Revolution]].

Longworth was born at Bellevue, [[Lot 49, Prince Edward Island]]. He studied law, was called to the bar in 1872 and set up practice in [[Charlottetown]]. He had been a [[magistrate]] in Charlottetown before being elected to the provincial [[legislature]] for the first time in 1904 as a [[Prince Edward Island Liberal Party|Liberal]]. In 1908, he was asked by the [[List of lieutenant governors of Prince Edward Island|lieutenant governor]] to become premier after the death of [[Arthur Peters]].

The Liberals had been in power since 1891 and their [[majority government|majority]] in the legislature had eroded over time. By the time Haszard became premier the Liberals and [[parliamentary opposition|opposition]] [[Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island|Conservatives]] had almost equal strength in the house.

Haszard represented PEI at the Maritime and Inter-Provincial conferences held in 1910 and attempted to obtain a better deal for the province from the federal government.

Haszard left politics in 1911 to accept an appointment to the province&amp;apos;s [[Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island|Supreme Court]] and as [[Master of the Rolls]]. He retired from the bench in 1930.
