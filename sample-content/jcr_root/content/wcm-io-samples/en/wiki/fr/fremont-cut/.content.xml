The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fremont Cut&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a part of the [[Lake Washington Ship Canal]]—which passes through the [[United States|U.S.]] city of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], linking [[Lake Washington]] to [[Puget Sound]]—that connects [[Lake Union]] to the east with [[Salmon Bay]] to the west. It is {{convert|5800|ft|m}} long and {{convert|270|ft|m}} wide. The center channel is {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|30|ft|m}} deep. It is spanned by the [[Fremont Bridge (Seattle)|Fremont Bridge]], a [[bascule bridge|bascule]] [[drawbridge]]--which connects the neighborhoods of [[Fremont, Seattle, Washington|Fremont]] and [[Queen Anne, Seattle|Queen Anne]] via Fremont Avenue North. A campus of [[Adobe Systems]] and the headquarters for [[Tableau Software]] are located at the north-eastern quadrant of this intersection of [[bridge]] and [[canal]], and an office of [[Google]] is located on the north-western quadrant.
