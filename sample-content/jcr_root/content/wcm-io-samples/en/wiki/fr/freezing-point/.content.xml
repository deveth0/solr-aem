&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Freezing Point&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Chinese: 冰点, Bīngdiǎn)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Pinyin translated with [http://www.cozychinese.com/convert/ CozyChinese.COM]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; is a news journal in the [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China]] which has been the subject of controversy over its criticism of Communist Party officials and the sympathetic ear it lent to a Chinese historian who had criticized official history textbooks. A weekly supplement to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[China Youth Daily]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, it was temporarily closed down by officials 24 January 2006, but was allowed to reopen in March that year,&amp;lt;!-- exact date?--&amp;gt; though without its former editor [[Li Datong]] and without [[Taiwan]]-based columnist [[Lung Yingtai]].&amp;lt;ref name=IoC&amp;gt;Isabel Hilton, &amp;quot;Surfing the Dragon&amp;quot;, Index on Censorship, Volume 35, Number 4, 2006, p. 33–42. 42.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The official reason for the January 2006 shutdown of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Freezing Point&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an article by history professor [[Yuan Weishi]] of [[Sun Yat-sen University]] (Zhongshan University). The article dissented from the official view of the [[Boxer Rebellion]].&amp;lt;ref name=IoC/&amp;gt;
