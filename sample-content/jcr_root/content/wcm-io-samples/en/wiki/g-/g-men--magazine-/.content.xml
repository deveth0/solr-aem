{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;G-men&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|ジーメン|Jīmen}} is a monthly [[Japan]]ese [[magazine]] for [[gay]] men. Gay magazines in Japan, along with much gay culture, are segregated by &amp;apos;type&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book

Like most gay men&amp;apos;s general-interest magazines, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;G-men&amp;apos;&amp;apos; includes editorial and photographic material, as well as prose stories and manga. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;G-men&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was designed to encourage steady readership by presenting a more well-defined fantasy image, and by running serialized, continuing manga stories (as opposed to the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] stories standard in other in gay men&amp;apos;s magazines) which encouraged purchase of every issue.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book
  | last = McLelland
  | first = Mark

  | isbn = 0-7007-1300-X}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Gengoroh Tagame]]&amp;apos;s work was an important influence on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;G-men&amp;apos;s&amp;apos;&amp;apos; style; he provided the cover for the first 60+ issues, as well as manga stories for most issues. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;G-men&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was also one of the first gay men&amp;apos;s publishers to offer collections of manga bound into &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[tankōbon]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The manga published in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;G-men&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, particularly Tagame&amp;apos;s work, was influential in the development of [[Bara (genre)|manga for gay men]] as a marketable category.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;G-men&amp;apos;&amp;apos; usually has approximately 300-500 pages, including several pages of glossy colour and some black and white photographs and drawings of hairy, sometimes bearded, muscular men in their 20s and 30s (these photographs are censored in accordance with Japan&amp;apos;s rules; while they feature explicit depictions of sex, genitals &amp;amp;mdash; and most pubic hair &amp;amp;mdash; are obscured).  The photographs sometimes feature traditional themes, such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[fundoshi]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, traditional Japanese loincloths.  Despite the inclusion of pornographic pictures and stories, however, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;G-men&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is not considered a pornographic magazine.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;G-men&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has fewer general articles than other magazines such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Barazoku]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and more short fiction and serialized stories.  Each month there are community listings, several different stories &amp;amp;mdash; often pornographic &amp;amp;mdash; and several in comic form as well, and advertisements from gay-related and gay-friendly businesses such as spas, clubs and hotels, bars, cafes and restaurants, host bars (hustler bars), brothels, and so forth.

Readers can also place personal ads free of charge, and each month there are several pages of these, most from men in search of romantic attachments, friends or sex partners. Such ads have long been a popular way for gay men to meet each other in Japan, though text messaging and the internet are probably more popular now.

The magazine is printed in Japanese only, and currently sells for ¥1800.
