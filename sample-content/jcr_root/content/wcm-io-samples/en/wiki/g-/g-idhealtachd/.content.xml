The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gàidhealtachd&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-gd|kɛːəlˠ̪t̪əxk|}} {{Audio|Gaidhealtachd.ogg|listen}}, [[Scottish English|English]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gaeldom&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), sometimes known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;A&amp;apos; Ghàidhealtachd&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (English: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the Gàidhealtachd&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), usually refers to the Scottish [[highlands and islands]], and especially the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] culture of the area. The corresponding [[Irish language|Irish]] word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Gaeltacht]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refers strictly to an Irish-speaking area. The term is also used to apply to the Gaelic-speaking areas of [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]].

The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the Gàidhealtachd&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is not truly interchangeable with the term [[Highlands of Scotland|highlands]], as it refers to the [[language]] and not to the [[geography]]. Also, many parts of the highlands no longer have substantial Gaelic-speaking populations, and some parts of what is now thought of as the Highlands have long been [[Scots language|Scots-speaking]] or English speaking areas: [[Caithness]], [[Cromarty]], [[Grantown-on-Spey]], [[Campbeltown]] etc. Conversely, several Gaelic-speaking communities lie outwith the [[Highland (council area)|Highland]], [[Argyll and Bute]] and [[Western Isles]] council areas, for example [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] and parts of [[Perth and Kinross]]. For this reason, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the Gàidhealtachd&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also increasingly refers to the regions in [[Scotland]] where Scottish Gaelic is spoken as a [[native language]] by much of the population; it can also refer to areas of [[Nova Scotia]] and other communities in Canada, such as [[Glengarry County, Ontario]], where the language has historically been spoken.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Galldachd&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gall-dom&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gall&amp;apos;&amp;apos; referring to a non-[[Gael]]) is often used for the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]], although it is also notable that the [[Hebrides]] are known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Innse Gall&amp;apos;&amp;apos; due to the historical presence of [[Norsemen]].

==History==
Until a few centuries ago, the Gàidhealtachd would have included much of modern-day Scotland north of the [[Firth of Forth]] and [[Galloway]] (up until the 18th century, and maybe later), excepting the [[Northern Isles]], as evidenced by the prevalence of Gaelic-derived place names throughout most of Scotland and contemporary accounts. These include [[Dundee]] from the Gaelic &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dùn Deagh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Inverness]] from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Inbhir Nis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Argyll]] from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earra-Ghàidheal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Galloway]] from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gall-Ghaidhealaibh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and possibly [[Stirling]] from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sruighlea&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (though the etymology is uncertain; see article). Gaelic speakers from what would be considered traditionally English-speaking/non-Gaelic regions today included [[George Buchanan (humanist)|George Buchanan]] from Stirlingshire, and [[Robert the Bruce]] and [[Margaret McMurray]] from Galloway and [[Ayrshire]].

For historical reasons, including the influence of a [[Scots language|Scots]]-speaking [[royal court]] in [[Edinburgh]] and the [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantation]] of [[merchant]] [[burgh]]s in much of the south and east, the Gàidhealtachd has been reduced massively to the present region of the [[Western Isles]], and the [[North-West Highlands]], [[Isle of Skye|Skye]] and [[Lochalsh]]  and [[Argyll and Bute]], with small Gaelic populations existing in [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The [[Highland Clearances]] of the 18th and 19th centuries also contributed to the decline of the language, as they reduced the population of the Scottish Highlands, which were predominantly Gaelic-speaking at the time.

==Canadian Gàidhealtachd==
{{main|Canadian Gaelic}}[[File:Distribution-gd-CA.png|thumb|330px|right|The Gaelic speaking areas of Maritime Canada.]]
Scottish Gaelic has also survived among communities descended from immigrants in parts of [[Nova Scotia]] (especially [[Cape Breton Island]]), [[Glengarry County, Ontario|Glengarry County]] in present day [[Ontario]], [[Prince Edward Island]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] (although Newfoundland had an [[Newfoundland Irish|Irish Gaelic]]-speaking population) in eastern [[Canada]] and those areas where Gaelic is spoken can also be said to be &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gàidhealtachdan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
