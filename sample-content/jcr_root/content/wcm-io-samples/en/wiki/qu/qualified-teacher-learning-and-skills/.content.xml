        text="&lt;p&gt;N.B. QTLS is a status, not a &amp;apos;License to Practice&amp;apos;.

In September 2007 the [[UK Government]] introduced reforms to the [[training]] and qualifications of all teachers, tutors, trainers, lecturers and instructors working in the post-compulsory education and training sector (sometimes referred to as the [[lifelong learning]] sector). However the regulations requiring all FE teachers etc. to be members of IfL were repealed through revocation with effect from 1 September 2012 and membership of IfL is no longer required.

==Gaining QTLS==

Although no longer required since September 2012, QTLS is still offered by IfL for a fee of Â£485. In order to obtain QTLS, the candidate is required to register with the [[Institute for Learning]], undertake and record annual [[Continuing Professional Development]] (CPD) and complete IfL&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;professional formation process&amp;apos;.
