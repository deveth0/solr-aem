Quest&amp;apos;s products include model rockets powered by standard 18&amp;amp;nbsp;mm motors as well as smaller rockets powered by Micro Maxx motors. The company produces both 18&amp;amp;nbsp;mm motors and Micro Maxx motors for use in its model rocket kits.  Powered by compressed [[black powder]] motors, some of these rockets can achieve altitudes of over 2000 feet. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
