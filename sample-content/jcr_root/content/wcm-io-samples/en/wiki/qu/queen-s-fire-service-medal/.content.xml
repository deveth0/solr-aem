The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen&amp;apos;s Fire Service Medal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is awarded to members of the fire services in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations]] for distinguished service or gallantry. It was introduced on 19 May 1954 when it replaced the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;King&amp;apos;s Fire Service Medal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Recipients may use the [[post-nominal letters]] “QFSM.”

The most common form of the award is the Queen&amp;apos;s Fire Service Medal for Distinguished Service.  The equivalent medal for gallantry, the Queen&amp;apos;s Fire Service Medal for Gallantry, is now rarely awarded. Acts of gallantry in the fire service would, since 1977, normally attract the [[George Medal]] or [[Queen&amp;apos;s Gallantry Medal]].

==Design==
* The medal is silver and 36 millimetres in diameter, with the obverse having the profile of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]].
* The medal&amp;apos;s reverse is a standing figure with a sword and shield, with an inscription of &amp;quot;For Gallantry&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;For Distinguished Fire Service&amp;quot; around the face&amp;apos;s side.
* The ribbon is of red with three yellow stripes. The Queen&amp;apos;s Fire Service Medal for Gallantry has a single thin blue stripe running through the centre of each yellow stripe.
