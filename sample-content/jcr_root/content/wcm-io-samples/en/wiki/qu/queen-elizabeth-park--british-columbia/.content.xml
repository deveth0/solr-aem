&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen Elizabeth Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[municipal park]] located in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], on Little Mountain (elevation approximately 168 metres&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Greater Vancouver Regional District, [http://www.gvrd.bc.ca/water/pdfs/LittleMountainFactsheetSept-04.pdf &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Facts Update&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}, September 2004, accessed 28 March 2007.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; or 550&amp;amp;nbsp;feet above sea level).  Its surface was scarred at the turn of the twentieth century when it was quarried for its rock, which served to build Vancouver&amp;apos;s first roadways.

In 1930, the park&amp;apos;s floral future was somewhat revealed when the BC Tulip Association suggested the notion of transforming the quarries into sunken gardens. By the end of that decade, the site had been turned over to the Vancouver Park Board for park and recreation purposes, and was dedicated as such by [[George VI|King George VI]] and his consort, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] (the mother of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]) on their much lauded visit to Vancouver in 1939, as [[Monarchy in Canada|King and Queen of Canada]]. From that time, Park staff incrementally transformed the overgrown hillsides into Canada&amp;apos;s first civic [[arboretum]], with a generous donation from the [[Canadian Pulp and Paper Association]]. The popular quarry gardens were designed by Park Board Deputy Superintendent Bill Livingstone and were unveiled in the early 1960s.

Prentice Bloedel&amp;apos;s gift of $1.25 million funded the open reservoirs and built the country&amp;apos;s first [[geodesic]] conservatory, which is surrounded by covered walkways, lighted fountains and a sculpture, [[Henry Moore]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Knife Edge Two Piece 1962â€“65]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The [[Bloedel Floral Conservatory]] opened on December 6, 1969 amidst much jubilation. Its enclosed tropical garden houses 500 exotic plants and flowers and more than a hundred free-flying tropical birds.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/bloedel-conservatory.aspx |title=Bloedel Conservatory |publisher=City of Vancouver |accessdate=6 October 2012 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
