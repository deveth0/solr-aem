&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Qur&amp;apos;an reading&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the reading (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[tarteel]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[tajwid]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;taghbir&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) aloud, [[Recitation|reciting]], or [[chanting]] of portions of the [[Qur&amp;apos;an]]. The reciter is called a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;muqri&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;tālī&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;murattil&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;mujawwid&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or most commonly a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[qari]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. (Touma 1996, p.&amp;amp;nbsp;153-154)
Recitation should be done according to rules of [[pronunciation]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], and [[caesura]]s established by the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], though first recorded in the eighth century CE. The most popular reading is that of Hafs on the authority of &#x60;asim. Similarly, each melodic passage centers on a single tone level, but the melodic contour and melodic passages are largely shaped by the reading rules, creating passages of different lengths whose temporal expansion is defined through caesuras. Skilled readers may read professionally for [[mosque]]s in cities.

The Qur&amp;apos;an is marked with twenty-six symbols, circles, rectangles, dashes and letters, some in color. These are written above, below, or beside the letters of the alphabet. They indicate the pronunciation of [[consonant]]s, whether the blending of neighboring or adjacent consonants is allowed, and where recitation [[pause]]s and caesuras are forbidden and possible (ibid, p.&amp;amp;nbsp;155).
In this last respect their function is analogous to that of Biblical [[cantillation]] marks, but unlike these they do not constitute a word-for-word notation of musical motifs.

==Ways of recitation==

There are 7 Mutawatir (a transmission which has independent chains of authorities so wide as to rule out the possibility of any error and on which there is consensus) ways of reading (or [[Qira&amp;apos;at]]) and 3 Mashhur (these are slightly less wide in their transmission, but still so wide as to make error highly unlikely) as listed below:

Mutawatir

* Nafi&amp;apos; (d. 169/785)
* Ibn Kathir (d. 120/737)
* [[Abu &amp;apos;Amr ibn al-&amp;apos;Ala&amp;apos;]] (d. 154/770)
* Ibn &amp;apos;Amir (d. 154/762)
* &amp;apos;Asim (d. 127/744)
* Hamza (d. 156/772)
* al-Kisa&amp;apos;i (d. 189/904)

Mashhur

* Abu Ja&amp;apos;far (d. 130/747)
* Ya&amp;apos;qub (d. 205/820)
* Khalaf (d. 229/843)

However, the most common is Hafs on the authority of &amp;apos;Asim, which have been used all over the world of [[Islam]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Bewley, Aishah. [http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ABewley/Page6.html &amp;quot;The Seven Qira&amp;apos;at of the Qur&amp;apos;an&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aisha Bewley&amp;apos;s Islamic Home Page&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Learning to read online==
Recently there is a growing trend to &amp;apos;[http://www.qforquran.com/ &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Learn Quran Reading&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]&amp;apos; via Internet.
