        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quitline&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a telephone [[helpline]] offering treatment for [[Substance dependence|addiction]] and behavior change/issues. Presently most quitlines treat [[tobacco]] or [[alcohol]] addiction. Quitlines are treatment centres that offer advanced treatment and should not be confused with [[call centres]].

==Smoking cessation quitlines==

Tobacco  quitlines have proven to be comparable to cessation clinics in terms of proportion of smokers smoke free at follow-up [1-4] but are more [[cost effective]]. [5] In general quitlines have been reported to enhance 12-month abstinence rates from 7% to approximately 30%. [6-9]

The [[treatment protocol]] in most tobacco cessation quitlines is a mixture of [[motivational interviewing]], [[behaviour therapy]], and [[pharmacological]] consultation. Qutiline numbers are presently printed on cigarette packages in several countries as a part of the [[Tobacco packaging warning messages|health warning labels]]. Tobacco quitlines may offer a [[reactive]] service, meaning that counsellors initiate no contact but clients signing up for support are encouraged to call the service whenever they need. Or a [[proactive]] service where clients signing up for treatment are offered a call up service. Many quitlines offer both reactive and proactive treatments and leave it up to the client to choose.

==Alcohol quitlines==
Telephone based advice ([[call centres]]) for alcoholics and their relatives are relatively common and some are gradually developing into telephone based treatment centres. However, alcohol quitlines are still at their infancy. In Sweden where telephone-based treatment for tobacco addiction is well established, an advanced  alcohol treatment quitline (first of its kind) opened in January 2007. The service is run in close collaboration with the Swedish national tobacco quitline. The primary aim of the Swedish alcohol quitline is to support people who are starting to lose control over their alcohol consumption to regain control. The treatment protocol is based on [[motivational interviewing]] and [[cognitive behavior therapy]] offering support to excessive consumers of alcohol and relatives alike.
