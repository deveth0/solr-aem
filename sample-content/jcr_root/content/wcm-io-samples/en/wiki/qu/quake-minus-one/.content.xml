&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quake Minus One&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[real-time strategy]] video game published for the [[Commodore 64]] by Monolith/Beyond in 1985 and was written by Warren Foulkes and [[Mike Singleton]].

==Premise==
In the 1980s, the [[Western world]] constructed a large power plant named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Titan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; under the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in order to extract [[geothermal]] [[energy]] from the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] where the Earth&amp;apos;s crust is thinnest. The power plant is operated and maintained solely by [[robot]]s. Members of the Robot Liberation Front invade the power plant and seize control of the robots demanding equal rights for the machines, failing which they would use the power plant to trigger a massive [[earthquake]] which would severely threaten [[Americas|America]], [[Europe]] and [[Africa]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Titan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is under the control of five separate computers - &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Zeus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Poseidon]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ares]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hermes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and scientists have managed to regain control of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hermes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the robots it operates. It is up to these robots to regain control of the other four computers who are moving to regain control.

==Gameplay==
The action begins with the player in control with a randomly placed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hermes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; controlled robot. The [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] is maneuvering its robots to take control of Hermes so it is up to the player to maneuver their robots and formulate a [[strategy]] to retake control of the wayward computers. The player does have one advantage - he can enter into the map mode which will pause the game allowing a brief respite from the action and a chance to view a detailed map of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Titan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; installation.

As robots travel down roads, they may come to roads controlled by other computers where they will be attacked by fixed installations such as [[bunker]]s. Robots that have [[ion]] cannons can capture roads and junctions putting them under the control of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hermes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Once a computer is captured, all its remaining robots are passed to the control of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hermes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. There are also quake suppression buildings to protect which if destroyed, bring forward the game&amp;apos;s deadline.

==User reception==
Although a highly anticipated title, Quake Minus One wasn&amp;apos;t well received. Although it won praise for its clear graphics and the sophistication of the interface, users often felt overwhelmed by what was going on and many made little to no progress with the game. The robots were cumbersome to operate and the [[joystick]] interface was difficult to use.
