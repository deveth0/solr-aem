        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quintus Lucretius Vespillo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the
son of another Quintus Lucretius Vespillo who was an orator and jurist. The elder Lucretius was proscribed by [[Sulla]] and murdered.

Lucretius served in the [[Pompeian]] military in 48 BC. He was proscribed by the [[triumvirs]] in 43 BC. His good fortune
was that he was concealed by his wife [[Curia (wife of Quintus Lucretius)|Curia]] in their home at Rome. He hid out there in the ceiling until his friends could obtain his pardon. In 20 BC he was one of the people selected as a candidate to represent the people that the [[Roman Senate]] sent to [[Augustus]] in [[Athens]] to request for him to assume the consulship in 19 BC. Lucretius was ultimately appointed as the [[Roman consul]] with C. Sentius Saturninus in that year.

He is believed to be the author of the [[Laudatio Turiae]], a tombstone engraved with a carved epitaph that is a husband&amp;apos;s eulogy for his wife.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.dl.ket.org/latin2/mores/women/womenful.htm &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Private Lives and Public Personae&amp;apos;&amp;apos; University of Tennessee]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
