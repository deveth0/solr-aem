In [[ancient Rome]], the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;quindecimviri sacris faciundis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were the fifteen (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;quindecim&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) members of a [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|college (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;collegium&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)]] with priestly duties. Most notably they guarded the [[Sibylline Books]], scriptures which they consulted and interpreted at the request of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. This &amp;apos;&amp;apos;collegium&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also oversaw the worship of any foreign gods which were introduced to Rome.

Originally these duties had been performed by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;duumviri&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;duoviri&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), two men of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] status. Their number was increased to ten by a Licinio-Sextian law in 367 BCE, which also stipulated that half of these priests were to be [[plebs|plebeian]]. During the [[Roman Republic#Middle Republic|Middle Republic]], members of the college were admitted through [[cooption]]. At some point in the 3rd century BC, several priesthoods, probably including the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;quindecimviri&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, began to be elected through the [[Tribal Assembly|voting tribes]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Andrew Lintott]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Constitution of the Roman Republic&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Oxford University Press, 1999), pp. 183â€“184 [http://books.google.com/books?id=yaFPohP2lB8C&amp;amp;pg=PA183&amp;amp;dq=%22quindecimviri+sacris+faciundis%22&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;amp;as_miny_is=&amp;amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;amp;num=100&amp;amp;as_brr=3&amp;amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22quindecimviri%20sacris%20faciundis%22&amp;amp;f=false online.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
