&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[microbrewery]] located in [[Quidi Vidi]] village, a neighbourhood of [[St. John&amp;apos;s, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John&amp;apos;s]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Canada]].

Founded by David Rees and David Fong in 1996, Quidi Vidi is the third-largest brewer in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, after [[Labatt]] and [[Molson]]. Its products are available province-wide in liquor stores, corner stores and on draft, and it is the most popular microbrew in the province. It is also the largest microbrewery in [[Atlantic Canada]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The names of Quidi Vidi&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Northern Lager&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Northern Light&amp;quot; beers were changed in 2005 after legal action by [[Northern Breweries]].  They were rebranded as &amp;quot;QV&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;QV Light&amp;quot;. Quidi Vidi brews four other varieties: Eric&amp;apos;s Cream Ale, 1892 Traditional Ale, QV Honey Brown Lager, and QV Honey Brown Light. A seventh variety, Iceberg, was launched in 2007/2008, and is so called because it is be brewed from glacial water from the [[iceberg]]s that are commonly found off the Newfoundland coast.

Quidi Vidi brews all their beers with no [[adjuncts]]; that is, no [[maize|corn]] or [[rice]], only [[malt]].
