A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;quartz arenite&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;quartzarenite&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[sandstone]] composed  of greater than 90% [[detrital]] [[quartz]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Blatt, Harvey and Robert J. Tracy, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Petrology: Igneous, Sedimentary, and Metamorphic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Freeman 2nd ed., 1996, p. 518 ISBN 0-7167-2438-3&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; with limited amounts of other framework grains ([[feldspar]], [[lithic fragments]], etc.) and [[matrix (geology)|matrix]].  It can have higher-than-average amounts of resistant grains, like [[chert]] and minerals in the [[ZTR index]].

The term &amp;apos;quartz arenite&amp;apos; is derived from the main component (quartz) and [[arenite]], a [[Latin]] term for a rock with [[sand]]-sized grains.  In some literature, these can be called [[orthoquartzite]]s, a confusing term which usually refers to the [[metamorphic rock]] [[quartzite]], though most metamorphic quartzites are diagentically fused from quartz arenites.  The term &amp;quot;quartzose sandstone&amp;quot; can also be used for a quartz arenite.

Quartz arenites are the most [[maturity (sedimentology)|mature]] [[sedimentary rock]]s possible, and are often referred to as ultra- or super-mature, and are usually cemented by silica.  They often exhibit both textural and compositional maturity.  The two primary [[sedimentary depositional environment]]s that produce quartz arenites are [[beach]]es/[[upper shoreface]] and [[aeolian processes]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Prothero, D. R. and Schwab, F., 1996, Sedimentary Geology, pg. 96-98, ISBN 0-7167-2726-9&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; due to their high residence time, high transport distance, and/or high energy of the environment.  Most of the time, these sediments are reworked over and over, even being [[eroded]] out of a lithified rock and becoming a brand new sediment and rock.  This is known as a multicycle sand.
