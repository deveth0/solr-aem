The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queens Botanical Garden&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; began as part of the 1939 New York [[World&amp;apos;s Fair]] in [[Queens]].  After the fair, the garden expanded to take up a larger portion of [[Flushing Meadows Park]].  When work was begun on construction of the 1964 World&amp;apos;s Fair, the garden was moved to a site across the street from Flushing Meadows Park.

The Queens Botanical Garden now consists of 39 acres (158,000 m²) of rose, bee, herb, and perennial gardens.  It is open to the public. Wedding photography is popular on the lawns by appointment.   Among other attractions, the garden hosts a [http://www.queensbotanical.org/gardens_collections/gardens/BeeGarden Bee Garden].

In 2005, it was among 406 [[New York City]] arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation]], which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]].

On September 27, 2007, Mayor Bloomberg and other dignitaries attended the ribbon cutting of QBG&amp;apos;s new visitor center. The center, designed by [[BKSK Architects]] was the first building in New York City to achieve the &amp;quot;Platinum&amp;quot; [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] rating, effectively becoming New York&amp;apos;s greenest building.
