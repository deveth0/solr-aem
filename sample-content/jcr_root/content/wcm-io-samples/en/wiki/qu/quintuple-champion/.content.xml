{{See also|List of boxing quintuple champions}}
In [[boxing]], a quintuple champion is a boxer who has won world titles in at least five [[Weight class (boxing)|different weight classes]].

The first man in boxing to earn this distinction was [[Thomas Hearns]] on November 4, 1988. Hearns won first the Welterweight (147&amp;amp;nbsp;lbs) title, later annexed the Super Welterweight (154&amp;amp;nbsp;lbs) belt. Rather than win the next closest division in weight, the Middleweight (160&amp;amp;nbsp;lbs), he moved up to three divisions to earn the Light Heavyweight (175&amp;amp;nbsp;lbs) title. He moved down in weight to net the Middleweight (160&amp;amp;nbsp;lbs) crown and finally moving back in weight up to Super Middleweight (168&amp;amp;nbsp;lbs) to become the first Quintuple Champion in the history of boxing.

Since then some boxers have managed to win six titles and become the [[Sextuple Champion]]s.
