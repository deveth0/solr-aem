After the formation of the [[Colonial navies of Australia#Queensland|Queensland Maritime Defence Force]] in 1884, the colonial government purchased two gunboats and a torpedo boat to equip the new force.{{sfn|Gillett|1977|p=105}} However, given the number of ports along the Queensland coast it was realised that additional ships were required. Five ships had already been ordered for the Queensland Department of Harbours and Rivers when the decision was taken to convert them to also serve as auxiliary gunboats. This resulted in the fitting of a 5-inch gun and the relocation of the boilers below the waterline.The ships were as follows: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bonito&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bream&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dolphin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pumba&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stingaree&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.{{sfn|Gillett|1977|p=110}}

Steam-propelled twin screwed &amp;quot;hopper barges&amp;quot;,{{sfn|Pixley|1972|p=18}} these ships were built by [[EDI Rail#History|Walkers]] at [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]] and, at 450 tons, they were the largest warships built in the Australian colonies before [[Federation of Australia|Federation]]. The [[Depression (economics)|depression]] of the 1890s greatly curtailed operations with most of the vessels placed in reserve and being used as training vessles. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stingaree&amp;apos;&amp;apos; served until 1895 whilst &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pumba&amp;apos;&amp;apos; remained on strength at the time of Federation in 1901, before being sold to Pioneer Gravels (Queensland). She was rebuilt in 1958 and renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Enterprise&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, serving as a cargo vessel beyond the late 1970s.{{sfn|Gillett|1977|p=110}} &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bream&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1963), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dolphin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1963) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stingaree&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1966) were sunk off [[Tangalooma]], [[Moreton Bay]].{{sfn|Diving the Gold Coast| |p=}}
