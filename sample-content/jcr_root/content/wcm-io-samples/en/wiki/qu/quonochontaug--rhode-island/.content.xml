==History==
Quonochontaug was the site of an iron mining operation financed by Thomas A. Edison in the 1880s.    Iron particles existed in the form of black sand on the beach and they could be separated out with magnets  and melted to produce iron.    The venture failed after cheaper iron was later discovered.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://edison.rutgers.edu/NamesSearch/DocDetImage.php3&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;    and here &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://edison.rutgers.edu/NamesSearch/glocpage.php3?gloc=D8139&amp;amp;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
