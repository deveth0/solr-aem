==History==
Queen Elizabeth College was founded in 1906 as Palmerston North Technical School. However the school was 4 years in the making, from a public meeting held in the city in 1902, gauging public interest in technical classes.[http://www.qec.school.nz/cent/history.html] The first classes were held at the Palmerston North High School and also at Campbell Street School.

In 1903, the High School and the Technical School were separated.

In 1908, land was bought at Princess Street, when in 1909 a building was opened to house the school (this is now the main campus of UCOL).

The school recently held its Centennial with a celebration over Queen&amp;apos;s Birthday Weekend.

==Notable alumni==
* [[Jacqui Dean]] former television and radio host, now National MP for Otago

==Notable staff==
* Catherine Vautier, Netball player, teacher, sports administrator. Vautier Park in Roslyn is named for her.
