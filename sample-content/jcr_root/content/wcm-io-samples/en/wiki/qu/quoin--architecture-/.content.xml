Building Construction. Part&amp;amp;nbsp;1. First Stage or Elementary Course. Second Edition—Revised. Published by B.T. Batsford, 52 High Holborn. 1889. Page&amp;amp;nbsp;48.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and in other cases to make a feature of a corner, creating an impression of permanence and strength, and reinforcing the onlooker’s sense of a structure’s presence.

Stone quoins are used on stone or [[brick]] buildings. Brick quoins may appear on brick buildings extruding from the facing brickwork in such a way as to give the appearance of blocks. Where quoins are used for decoration and not for load-bearing, they may be made from a variety of materials including brick, stone or [[Lumber|timber]].

In one common form of decorative use, quoins wrap around the wall with their longest sides oriented horizontally, first left, then right about the corner. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;long and short&amp;apos;&amp;apos; quoining method places long stone blocks with their lengths oriented vertically, between smaller stone blocks that are laid flat. This load bearing quoining is common in Anglo-Saxon buildings such as that of [[St Bene&amp;apos;t&amp;apos;s Church]] in Cambridge, England.
