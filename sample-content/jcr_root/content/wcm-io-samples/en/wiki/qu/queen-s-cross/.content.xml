&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen&amp;apos;s Cross&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is area in the west-end of [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]]. It is located just west from the main Union Street and about {{convert|1.5|mi}} from the geographical town centre at Mercat Cross.

Queen&amp;apos;s Cross itself is the intersection of Fountainhall Road, Queen&amp;apos;s Road, St Swithins Street, Albyn Place and Carden Place. There is a roundabout with [[Queen Victoria]]&amp;apos;s bronze statue in the middle. She is facing west, looking up Queen&amp;apos;s Road towards [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]]- her summer residence. It was originally erected by the royal tradesmen of the city at the south-east corner of St Nicholas Street and [[Union Street, Aberdeen|Union Street]] in 1893, replacing an earlier (1866) marble sculpture by Alexander Brodie (removed to the Town House in 1888) but was moved to its present location in 1964.

There are two [[Church of Scotland]] churches, [[Queen&amp;apos;s Cross Church, Aberdeen|Queen&amp;apos;s Cross Church]] and [[Rubislaw Church]] at the intersection and also St Joseph&amp;apos;s Primary School.

The surrounding buildings and their streets are typical of the Victorian period it was built in. They are built of the local gray [[granite]].

The Queen&amp;apos;s Cross area, particularly Queen&amp;apos;s Road and Albyn Place is home to the offices of many finance businesses who have moved into the old Victorian mansion houses. There are also a number of exclusive restaurants and bars in the area.

This area is considered by many in the local area as the centre point of the West End of Aberdeen.

On 19 April 2012 63-year old Renee Slater was charged by [[Grampian Police]] under the [[Representation of the People Act]], for entering tailor&amp;apos;s dummy, named &amp;quot;Helena Torry&amp;quot;, as a candidate for the forthcoming council elections for Hazlehead, Ashley and Queens Cross ward.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2012/04/20/police-arrest-woman-after-dummy-is-put-up-for-local-council-elections-86908-23831250/ &amp;quot;Police arrest woman after dummy is put up as candidate for local council elections&amp;quot; at dailyrecord.co.uk]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
