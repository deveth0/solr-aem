&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quebec High School&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;QHS&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[high school]] belonging to the [[Central Quebec School Board]]. The School is located in [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec, Canada]], and is one of three English-language high schools that serve the Quebec region (the others being Saint-Patrick&amp;apos;s High School and Dollard-des-Ormeaux located on CFB Valcartier). The school is composed of three main floors. While the school once had a separate girls wing and boys wing, it is now is a mixed school integrating both sexes.

In 2006, QHS began a three year process to implement an initiative called the Community Learning Centre Project. This initiative was made possible through the Canada Entente agreement with the federal government and the Quebec Ministry of Education.
