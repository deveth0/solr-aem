&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the son of [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus]] and a [[Consul]] in 292 and 276 BC.
In 295 BC, as [[curule aedile]], he fined certain matrons of noble birth for their disorderly life and with the proceeds built a temple to [[Venus]] near the [[Circus Maximus]].

He was consul in 292 BC, with his father as a Legate. His Battle against the [[Pentrian Samnites]] ended with no victory to either side. In a second battle the consul retrieved his reputation, stormed several Samnite towns, and was rewarded with a [[Roman Triumph|triumph]] of which the most remarkable feature was old Fabius riding beside his son&amp;apos;s chariot.

In 291 BC, he was [[proconsul]] in [[Samnium]]. There he was besieging [[Cominium]] when the consul, [[Lucius Postumius Megellus]], arbitrarily and violently drove him from the army and the province (according to the Roman tradition). The [[Fasti]] ascribe a triumph to Fabius for his proconsulate.

He was consul for the second time in 276, when he obtained a second triumph (Samnium and Brutium). Shortly afterwards he went as [[legatus]] from [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] to [[Ptolemy Philadelphus]], king of [[Egypt]]. The presents which Fabius and his colleagues received from the Egyptian monarch they deposited in the public treasury on their return to Rome, but a decree of the [[Senate of Rome|Senate]] directed that the ambassadors should retain them.

At about 265, he succeeded his father as [[Princeps Senatus]].

His son [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges (consul 265 BC)|Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges]] was consul in 265 BC.
