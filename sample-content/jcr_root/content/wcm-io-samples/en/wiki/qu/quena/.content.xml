[[Image:Quena01.jpg|thumb|220px|The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;quena&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a South American wind instrument, mostly used by Andean musicians]]

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;quena&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-qu|qina}}, sometimes also written &amp;quot;kena&amp;quot; in English) is the traditional [[flute]] of the [[Andes]]. Traditionally made of [[bamboo]] or wood, it has 6 finger holes and one thumb hole, and is open on both ends or the bottom is half-closed (choked). To produce [[sound]], the player closes the top end of the pipe with the flesh between his chin and lower lip, and blows a stream of air downward, along the axis of the pipe, over an elliptical notch cut into the end. It is normally in the key of G, with G4 being the lowest note (all holes covered). It produces a very &amp;quot;textured&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dark&amp;quot; timbre because of the length-to-bore ratio of about 16 to 20, which is very unlike the tone of the [[Western concert flute]] with bore ratio about 38.

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;quenacho&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also &amp;quot;kenacho&amp;quot; in English) is a greater, lower-toned version of the quena and made the same way. It is in the key of D, with D4 being the lowest note, a perfect fourth lower than the quena. It produces a very &amp;quot;rich&amp;quot;  timbre because of the length-to-bore ratio of about 25, paradoxically brighter by comparison to the quena.

Quena is mostly used in traditional [[Andean music]]. In the 1960s and 1970s the quena was used by several [[Nueva Canción]] musicians, this use was in most cases for particular songs and not as a standard instrument but some groups such as [[Illapu]] have used it regularly. In the 1980s and 1990s some post-Nueva Canción rock groups have also incorporated the quena in some of their songs; notably [[Soda Stereo]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cuando Pase el Temblor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and [[Los Enanitos Verdes]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lamento Boliviano&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The quena is also relatively common in [[World music]].

==Other flutes and specific instruments similar to the flute==
Other Andean flutes include
*The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[pinkillo|pinquillo]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also pinkuyo or pinkiyo), has the same fingering as the quena, and is similar in appearance and operation to a [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]. Unlike the actual quena, it has an air channel or fipple to conduct the air;
*The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[tarka (flute)|tarka]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or tharqa), which also operates like a recorder but is comparatively shorter and quite angular in shape, requires greater breath, and has a darker, more penetrating sound;
*The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;moseño&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (originally mohoseño), is a long, dual-tube bamboo flute with a deep sound. The auxiliary tube acts as an aeroduct.

==In popular culture==
In most of [[Andes]]&amp;apos; towns &amp;quot;vamos a ir a la quena&amp;quot; (we will go to the quena) was a popular sentence to threaten little children, because the quena was made of bamboo, a hard material.
