&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen of the Broken Hearts&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; was a song released on the Canadian rock band [[Loverboy]]&amp;apos;s album titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Keep It Up]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1983. The band released as a single later that year, and it reached #34 on the charts. Despite being remembered as one of the band&amp;apos;s better hits, the song was not included on the main two compilation albums released by the band; [[Loverboy Classics]] and [[Big Ones (album)|Big Ones]]

The video for &amp;quot;Queen of the Broken Hearts&amp;quot; was the subject of an [[MTV]] contest in the summer of 1983, in which an MTV viewer won the chance to &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; in Loverboy&amp;apos;s next video. The contest was won by a woman named Bridget Magnesi, who appeared very briefly in one shot, behind a bank of computer monitors about 15 seconds into the video.
