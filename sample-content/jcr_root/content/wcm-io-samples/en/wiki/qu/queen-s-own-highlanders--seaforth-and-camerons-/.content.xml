The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen&amp;apos;s Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, officially abbreviated &amp;quot;QO HLDRS,&amp;quot; was an [[infantry]] [[regiment]] in the [[Scottish Division]] of the [[British Army]]. It was formed on 7 February 1961 at [[Redford Barracks]], [[Edinburgh]], with the amalgamation of 1st [[Battalion]], [[Seaforth Highlanders]] and 1st Battalion, [[Queen&amp;apos;s Own Cameron Highlanders]]. Due to the [[Options for Change]] defence review, however, 1st Battalion, Queen&amp;apos;s Own Highlanders was further amalgamated with 1st Battalion, [[Gordon Highlanders]] on 17 September 1994 to form 1st Battalion, [[The Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons)]].

The regiment wore the [[Clan Mackenzie|MacKenzie]] [[tartan]] [[kilt]] and [[Clan Cameron|Cameron]] [[trews]], with the reverse for the bandmembers.
