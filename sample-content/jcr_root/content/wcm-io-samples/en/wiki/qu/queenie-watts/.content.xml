&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queenie Watts&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (21 July 1926, [[London]], England&amp;amp;nbsp;– 25 January 1980 London, England) was an English actress and singer of film and television.

She appeared in many British films, including the [[Joan Littlewood]] production &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sparrers Can&amp;apos;t Sing]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1963) as herself in scenes set in the Iron Bridge Tavern, [[Millwall]], which she ran in real life and in which she starred in the TV series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Stars and Garters]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1963). She also appeared in the film version of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Up the Junction (film)|Up the Junction]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1968) and as a pub landlady in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;All Coppers Are..&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1972) and in television programmes through the 1960s and 1970s, including the successful, but critically panned, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Romany Jones]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1972–75) and its sequel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Yus, My Dear]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1976) in which [[Arthur Mullard]] featured as her husband. She appeared in three episodes of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Play for Today&amp;apos;&amp;apos; anthology series for the BBC, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Waterloo Sunset&amp;apos;&amp;apos; transmitted on 23 January 1979.

Watts appeared in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dad&amp;apos;s Army]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the role of Mrs Edna Peters, also in several episodes of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dixon of Dock Green]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in different roles, and in the comedy-drama &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Beryl&amp;apos;s Lot]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1973–75) and one episode of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Steptoe and Son]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1972).

Watts also appeared with Arthur Mullard, again as a married couple, and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[On the Buses]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; cast in the 1973 film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Holiday on the Buses]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as well as the popular [[sitcom]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[George and Mildred]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as the former neighbours of the characters played by [[Yootha Joyce]] and [[Brian Murphy (actor)|Brian Murphy]].

She ran pubs (including the Iron Bridge Tavern, East India Dock Road, London and the Rose and Crown, Pennyfields, Poplar) with her husband, &amp;quot;Slim Watts&amp;quot;, where she also sang and played piano with an eight-piece band to pull in more customers. She appeared in the 1966 film version of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, singing &amp;quot;[[Goodbye, Dolly Gray]]&amp;quot; in a memorable, riotous bar-room brawl sequence.

Queenie Watts died from cancer in 1980, aged 53.
