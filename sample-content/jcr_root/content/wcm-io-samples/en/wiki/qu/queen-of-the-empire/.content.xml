==Plot==
When a demonstration of a &amp;quot;decoy&amp;quot; Human Replica Droid of [[Princess Leia Organa|Leia]] goes wrong and the droid shoots a scientist, [[Han Solo|Han]] and Leia are forced to fly him to his home planet of Chad to get treatment. When they reach the planet&amp;apos;s hospital a [[hurricane]] is ravaging it. After Han is able to bring the scientist to the doctors, he is trapped by falling rubble caused by the storm. When Leia eventually saves him, he reveals that the experience scared him that he wouldn&amp;apos;t be able to reveal his big plans. Upon leaving the scientist in the doctors&amp;apos; care, Han proposes to Leia and they plan on eloping at Hologram Fun World, an amusement park. With the help of the new owner of the park, [[Lando Calrissian]], they plan a wedding and visit many [[hologram]] attractions, including a trip through the [[Alderaan]] of Leia&amp;apos;s memories.

While they are at the park, one of [[Zorba the Hutt]]&amp;apos;s spies in the park tells him that Leia is alive and he plans on capturing her and killing her on [[Tatooine]] as she did to his son. With some help, he manages to capture her during a magic show and take her to his ship, with the carbonite-frozen body of [[Jedi Prince#Trioculus|Trioculus]], for the trip to Tatooine. Zorba&amp;apos;s ship, however, is captured by the Moffship of [[Jedi Prince#Grand Moff Hissa|Grand Moff Hissa]]. When they discover Trioculus is still alive, he is quickly unfrozen and only spares Zorba&amp;apos;s life when Zorba reveals where Leia is. Hoping to turn Leia to his side, Trioculus drops Zorba into the [[Pit of Carkoon]] into the mouth of the Sarlacc. While Trioculus makes plans to marry Leia, Han and Lando, joined by Luke, Ken and the Human Replica Droid of Leia are able to infiltrate the Moffship and plan a rescue operation. They rescue Leia and are able to replace her with the Human Replica Droid, who goes to the wedding in Leia&amp;apos;s place. While the [[Millennium Falcon]] escapes, the droid&amp;apos;s lasers pierce Trioculus&amp;apos; heart. As he lay dying, unbeknownst to anyone, Zorba crawled out of the Sarlacc, as no creature in the universe can digest a Hutt.
