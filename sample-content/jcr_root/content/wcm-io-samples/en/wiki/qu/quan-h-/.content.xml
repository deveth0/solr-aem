&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quan họ&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; singing is a [[Music of Vietnam|Vietnamese]] [[folk music]] style characterized both by its [[antiphon]]al nature, with alternating groups of [[female]] and [[male]] [[singers]] issuing musical challenges and responses, and by the fact that most of the songs in the repertoire deal with topics of [[love]] and [[sentimentality]] as experienced by young [[adults]].&amp;lt;ref name=Le2002&amp;gt;{{cite web

Quan ho is recognised as the Intangible Cultural Heritage by the [[UNESCO]] in 2009.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=00183 UNESCO Culture Sector - Intangible Heritage - 2003 Convention :]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The quan họ style originated in what is now [[Bắc Ninh Province]] and was first recorded in the 13th century, and has traditionally been associated with the [[Spring (season)|spring]] [[festival]]s that follow the celebration of [[Tết]] (the Vietnamese [[New Year]]). Historically, the singing began on the evening before the festival, but today it is much more common for the singing to occur on the main day of the festival. In general, an initial &amp;quot;challenge phrase&amp;quot; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;câu ra&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) from the known body of songs is sung by a pair of female singers, following which a pair of male singers will respond by selecting and singing a &amp;quot;matching phrase&amp;quot; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;câu đối&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), which must repeat the [[melody]] of the challenge phrase. Once they are finished, the order is reversed, and the men will issue their own challenge phrase with a different melody. While in the past the singing was unaccompanied, it is common today for the singers to be [[accompaniment|accompanied]] by [[Musical instrument|instruments]], whether traditional Vietnamese instruments or modern ones such as electric keyboards.&amp;lt;ref name=Le2002/&amp;gt;

There are a huge number of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;quan họ&amp;apos;&amp;apos; melodies, with thousands of different songs having been recorded and written down in score form. A simpler variant of response song, allowing spoken responses and sung by boys and girls at village festivals is [[trống quân]] singing.
