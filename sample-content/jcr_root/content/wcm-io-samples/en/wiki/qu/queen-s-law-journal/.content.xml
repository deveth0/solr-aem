The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen&amp;apos;s Law Journal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a Canadian peer-reviewed law review. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Journal&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is published by [[Queen&amp;apos;s University]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]], [[Canada]]

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Journal&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was established in 1968 as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen&amp;apos;s Intramural Law Journal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The purpose of this periodical was to publish a selection of the best work written by law students at Queen&amp;apos;s. In 1971, the title was changed to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen&amp;apos;s Law Journal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, reflecting a change in editorial policy. While it continued to publish student work, the Journal began seeking contributions from academics and other members of the legal profession.

By the mid-1970s, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Journal&amp;apos;&amp;apos; had evolved into its present formâ€”a vehicle for scholarship by legal academics, practitioners, and law students. In time, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Journal&amp;apos;&amp;apos; became a fully refereed publication. All submissions that pass the internal review process are subject to a double-blind external assessment by at least two experts in the relevant subject area.
