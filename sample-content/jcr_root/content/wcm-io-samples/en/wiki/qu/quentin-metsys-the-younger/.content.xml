&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quentin Metsys the Younger&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (rarely &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quinten&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Massys&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (c.1543&amp;amp;ndash;1589)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Metsys&amp;quot; is the usual and preferred spelling for the grandson; see [http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=metsys&amp;amp;role=&amp;amp;nation=&amp;amp;prev_page=1&amp;amp;subjectid=500025949 Getty Union list]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was a [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[Renaissance]] painter, one of several of his countrymen active as [[artists of the Tudor court]] in the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England]].  He was the son of [[Flanders|Flemish]] painter [[Jan Matsys|Jan Massys, Matsys, or Metsys]] and the grandson and namesake of [[Quentin Massys|Quentin Massys or Metsys]].

The younger Quentin was born in [[Antwerp]], where he joined the Guild of St. Luke in 1574; by c. 1581 he was living in London, likely having fled religious persecution in Antwerp as his father and uncle had done.  He left England for Frankfurt in 1588 and died there the next year.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Hearn, p. 86&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He is best known for the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sieve Portrait&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of Elizabeth I, in which she is depicted as [[Tuccia]], a [[Vestal Virgin]] who proved her chastity by carrying water from the [[Tiber River]] to the [[Temple of Vesta]] without spilling a drop.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;See Hearn, p. 85.  Although [[Roy Strong]] attributed the painting to [[Cornelis Ketel]] in 1969 and again in 1987 (see Strong 1987 p. 101), closer examination has revealed that the painting is signed and dated on the base of the globe &amp;apos;&amp;apos;1583. Q. MASSYS | ANT&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (for &amp;quot;of Antwerp&amp;quot;).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
Elizabeth is surrounded by symbols of empire, including a [[column]] and a [[globe]], [[iconography]] that would appear again and again in her portraiture of the 1580s and 1590s, most notably in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Armada Portrait]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of 1588.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Hearn, p. 85; Strong 1987 p. 101&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
