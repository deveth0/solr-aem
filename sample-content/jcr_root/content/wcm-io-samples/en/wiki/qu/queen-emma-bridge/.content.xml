The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen Emma Bridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[pontoon bridge]] across [[Sint Anna Bay|St. Anna Bay]] in [[Curaçao]]. It connects the Punda and [[Otrobanda]] quarters of the capital city, [[Willemstad]]. The bridge is hinged and opens regularly to enable the passage of ocean going vessels. On the opposite end from the hinge is a small shelter where an operator controls two diesel engines turning propellers. The propellers are mounted perpendicular to the length of the bridge and allow it to swing parallel to the shore. The process only takes a few minutes to complete.

The bridge was built in 1888 and was completely renovated in 1939.  Originally it was a toll bridge. Individuals without shoes were permitted to cross the bridge without paying the toll; however, today, a toll is no longer applied. When the bridge swings open, two ferries spring into action to bring pedestrians across the water. The ferries are also free of charge.
