&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quicksand&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 2003 [[direct-to-video]] [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[France|French]]-[[Germany|German]] co-produced [[action film]] starring [[Michael Keaton]] and [[Michael Caine]]. It was released in [[Germany]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] in 2003, in [[United States]] on March 16, 2004 and in the [[United Kingdom]] on November 1, 2004. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quicksand&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was filmed in South France between December 2000 and January 2001, originally set for a 2002 release.

== Plot ==
Martin Raikes ([[Michael Keaton]]) is a bank investigator who is sent to [[Monaco]] to check up on the shady dealings of a movie production. After the business trip, he&amp;apos;ll then fly over to London to visit his daughter.

When Martin arrives in Monaco, he is met by the film company&amp;apos;s CFO, Lela Forin ([[Judith Godreche]]) and washed-up action star Jake Mellows ([[Michael Caine]]).

Something is rotten with the production, though, and Martin senses it. Unfortunately, he sticks his nose in a little too deep for the corrupt bankrollers&amp;apos; tastes, and is soon deemed a threat to them. Martin is first offered a mega-bribe, but he rejects it. As it turns out, the bankrollers are Russian mafia, led by Oleg Butraskaya ([[Rade Sherbedgia]]).

Suddenly, Martin finds himself framed for an assassination attempt, and the hostile authorities—on the payroll of the mob—want to kill him. The American authorities are also hot on his trail, investigating him for money laundering, among other false charges.

As Martin sifts through the mystery, he reveals the nefarious nature of Oleg&amp;apos;s rackets, which include illegal pornography and money laundering. Not knowing whom to trust, he turns to Lela. Soon, she, too, is marked for death, and the two go on the run, before meeting up with Jake, who joins the group.

They put their minds together, desperate to find a way to clear their names and survive.
