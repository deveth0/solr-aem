        text="&lt;p&gt;In [[neuroscience]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;quantum brain dynamics&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (QBD) is a hypothesis to explain the function of the [[brain]] within the framework of [[quantum field theory]].

Large systems, such as those studied biologically, have less symmetry than the idealized systems or single crystals often studied in physics.  [[Jeffrey Goldstone]] proved that where symmetry is broken, additional [[boson]]s, the [[Nambu-Goldstone boson]]s, will then be observed in the spectrum of possible states; one canonical example being the [[phonon]] in a [[crystal]].

Ricciardi and Umezawa proposed in 1967 a general theory of quanta of long-range [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] waves within and between brain cells, and showed a possible mechanism of memory storage and retrieval in terms of Nambu-Goldstone bosons.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Umezawa1967&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal
