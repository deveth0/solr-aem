The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen Anneâ€™s Railroad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[railroad]] that ran from [[Love Point, Maryland]] to [[Lewes, Delaware]] and was connected to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] via [[ferry]].  The Queen Anne&amp;apos;s Railroad [[railroad company|company]] was formed in Maryland in 1894, and received legislative authorization from Delaware in February 1895.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Archives&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web| url=http://archives.delaware.gov/markers/sc/QUEEN%20ANNES%20RAILROAD%20SC%20116.shtml| title=Queen Anne&amp;apos;s Railroad| publisher=State of Delaware, Delaware Public Archives| date=October 31, 2007}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The railroad&amp;apos;s original western terminus was in [[Queenstown, Maryland]], and was moved via a {{convert|13|mi|adj=on}} extension to Love Point in 1902,&amp;lt;ref name=StevensvilleDepot&amp;gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.historicqac.org/sites/StTrain.htm| title=Stevensville Train Depot| publisher=Historic Sites Consortium of Queen Anne&amp;apos;s County}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; which shortened the ferry trip to Baltimore.

The Queen Anne&amp;apos;s Railroad Company began operating a summer-only Cape May Express between Queenstown, Maryland and Lewes, Delaware in 1901 with a connecting steamer to [[Cape May, New Jersey]]. The company owned and operated the Queen Anne&amp;apos;s Ferry &amp;amp; Equipment Company which consisted of the steamers Endeavor, Queen Anne and Queen Caroline.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.scripophily.net/quanracoma19.html Queen Anne&amp;apos;s Railroad Company - Maryland 1902].

Through a complex series of acquisitions in 1905, Queen Anne&amp;apos;s Railroad ceased to exist and its assets became the property of the Maryland, Delaware and Virginia Railway Company (MD&amp;amp;V), a subsidiary of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Archives&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Parks&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.r2parks.net/B&amp;amp;E.html|title=History of the Baltimore and Eastern Railroad|author=Richard Parks|date=August 15, 2009|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Much of the rairload&amp;apos;s original track has been abandoned, but segments are still used for freight rail service by the [[Delaware Coast Line Railroad]].  In [[Queen Anne&amp;apos;s County, Maryland]], a project has converted much of the railroad right-of-way into part of the [[Cross Island Trail]], a [[rail trail]] which is in turn part of the [[American Discovery Trail]].  The path of the railroad is approximated today by the following roads:
*[[Maryland Route 18]]
*[[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|U.S. Route 50]]
*[[Maryland Route 404]]
*[[Maryland Route 16]]
*[[Delaware Route 16]]
*[[Delaware Route 1]]
*[[U.S. Route 9 in Delaware|U.S. Route 9]].

A Delaware state historical marker in Milton and another in Ellendale&amp;apos;s historic Railroad Square district commemorate the railroad. The original railroad stations in Stevensville and Sudlersville are both still in existence and serve as museums.&amp;lt;ref name=StevensvilleDepot /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- [http://www.abc2news.com/news/state/story.aspx?content_id=f0b65d66-a0d3-4924-8253-8c7e33d06f59] dead link 2008-10-23 --&amp;gt;
