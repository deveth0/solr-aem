&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quercus michauxii&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;swamp chestnut oak&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a species of [[oak]] in the [[List of Quercus species#Section Quercus|white oak section]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quercus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; section &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quercus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, native to bottomlands and wetlands in the southern and central [[United States]], from [[New Jersey]] south to northern [[Florida]], and west to [[Missouri]] and eastern [[Texas]]; it is rare north of the [[Ohio River]].

==Classification and nomenclature==
The swamp chestnut oak closely resembles the [[chestnut oak]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quercus prinus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and for that reason has sometimes been treated as a variety of that species.  However, the swamp chestnut oak is a larger tree which differs in preferred habitat, and the [[bark]] does not have the distinctive deep, rugged ridging of the chestnut oak, being thinner, scaly, and paler gray. It typically grows to around 65 ft (20 m) tall, though the tallest specimen currently known is over 42m tall.

The name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Q. prinus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was long used by many botanists and foresters for the swamp chestnut oak, even when treated as a species distinct from the chestnut oak, which was then called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Q. montana&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but the application of the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Q. prinus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to the chestnut oak is now often accepted,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The confusion arose from differing identifications of the [[type (biology)|type specimens]] for the [[Linnaeus|Linnaean]] name, by some (but not all) botanists considered resolved by close examination of the leaf pubescence, which differs in the two species.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; although sometimes that name is declared to be of uncertain position, unassignable to either species, with the chestnut oak then called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Q. montana&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Flora of North America&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;FNA Qmontana&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Quercus montana|url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;amp;taxon_id=233501064|work=Flora of North America|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Description==
The [[leaf|leaves]] of the swamp chestnut oak are simple, 4-11 in (10-28 cm) long and 2-7 in (5-18 cm) broad, with 15-20 lobe-like, rounded simple teeth on each side, similar to those of chestnut oak and [[Quercus muehlenbergii|chinkapin oak]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quercus muehlenbergii&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), although they generally do not achieve the more slender form that the leaves of those trees may exhibit at times. The [[fruit]] is an [[acorn]] 1-1½ in (2.5-3.5 cm) long and ¾-1 in (2-2.5) cm broad, borne on a ¾-1¼ nin (2-3 cm) peduncle, maturing in the fall, about 6 months after pollination.{{fact|date=October 2011}}

==Ecology==
{{empty section|date=October 2011}}

==Uses==
The [[wood]] of the swamp chestnut oak is similar to, and usually marketed mixed with, other white oaks.{{fact|date=October 2011}} The swamp chestnut oak&amp;apos;s wood can be sliced into flexible strips suitable for [[basket weaving]],{{fact|date=October 2011}} and for this reason the species is sometimes called the &amp;quot;basket oak&amp;quot;.

The swamp chestnut oak&amp;apos;s [[acorn]]s are large and relatively sweet.  They are readily eaten by [[livestock]],{{fact|date=October 2011}} and the species is sometimes called the &amp;quot;cow oak&amp;quot; for this reason.  However, swampchestnut oaks bear heavy crops of acorns only at intervals of several years.{{fact|date=October 2011}}

The swamp chestnut oak is sometimes cultivated as a large garden tree or street tree, and is quite easy to grow if it is not subject to extreme urban conditions.{{fact|date=October 2011}}
