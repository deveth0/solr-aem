        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen Anne&amp;apos;s Bounty&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a fund established in 1704 to augment the incomes of the poorer clergy of the [[Church of England]]. The bounty was funded by the tax (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[annates]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) on the incomes of all Church of England clergy, which was paid to the Pope until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and thereafter to the Crown.

In 1890, the total amount distributed was [[Pound sterling|Â£]]176,896.

On 2 April 1947, by the Church Commissioners Measure 1947, the functions and assets of Queen Anne&amp;apos;s Bounty were merged with the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] to form the [[Church Commissioners]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web
