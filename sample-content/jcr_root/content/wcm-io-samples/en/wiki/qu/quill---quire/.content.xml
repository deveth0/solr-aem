&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quill &amp;amp; Quire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a [[Canadian]] [[magazine]] about the book and publishing industry, was launched in 1935 and has an average circulation of 5,000 copies per issue, with a publisher-claimsed readership of 25,000. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quill &amp;amp; Quire&amp;apos;&amp;apos; reviews books and magazines and provides a forum for discussion of trends in the publishing industry.

Launched in 1935 by Wallace Seccombe&amp;apos;s Current Publications, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quill &amp;amp; Quire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s original editorial focus was on office supplies and stationery, with books taking on increasing importance only as Canada&amp;apos;s fledgling indigenous book publishing industry began to grow and flourish. In 1971, [[Michael de Pencier]] purchased the magazine from [[Southam Newspapers|Southam]] (who had bought it from Seccombe and owned it for just six months). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quill &amp;amp; Quire&amp;apos;&amp;apos; remained with de Pencier as part of the Key Publishers/Key Media stable for 30 years, until its sale in 2003 (as part of a larger transaction involving Key Media) to St. Josephs Corporation, a Canadian-owned and -controlled printing and media company based in Concord, Ontario.

The current editorial masthead includes Stuart Woods, editor-in-chief; Sue Carter Flinn, web editor; Steven Beattie, review editor; and Dory Cerny, Books for Young People editor. The publisher is Alison Jones and the associate publisher is Attila Berki, founder and former owner of the small publishing house Riverbank Press. Athena St. Jacques is the magazine&amp;apos;s art director and Chelsea Murray is the marketing manager.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.quillandquire.com/about.cfm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Previous editor-in-chief [[Derek Weiler]] died on April 12, 2009 as the result of a chronic heart condition. Other former staff editors include Ted Mumford, Scott Anderson, [[Kenneth Oppel]], [[Bert Archer]] and James Grainger.

The publication is considered a significant source of short reviews for new Canadian books.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/literaryarchives/027011-200.107-e.html | accessdate=2008-01-28 | title=Authors : An Exhibition of Photographs by Arnaud Maggs, Paul Orenstein and John Reeves, 1964-1983. | publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The magazine is currently published by [[St. Joseph Media]], which also publishes &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Toronto Life]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
