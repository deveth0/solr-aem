&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queer literary interpretation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a method of [[literary interpretation]] stemming from [[Marxism]], [[feminism]], [[psychoanalysis]] and the [[gay rights]] movement. It is an addition to [[literary theory]] in the 1980s.

Only partially based on [[gay]], [[lesbian]] and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] issues, a queer literary interpretation is largely concerned with sexual identity, especially &amp;quot;closeted&amp;quot; (hidden) sexual identity.  Other &amp;quot;closeted&amp;quot; aspects of works are often examined, as well.

There are opposing views of queer literary theory.  One view is that sexual identity is &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot;, and may be discerned by careful study.  The opposing view is that sexual identity is both fluid and socially constructed, and thus there is no &amp;quot;absolute&amp;quot; identity.

Questions that a queer literary interpretation might attempt to answer:
* What does the work tell the reader about the author&amp;apos;s sexual identity?
* Conversely, how might the author&amp;apos;s sexual identity affect different aspects of work?
* What doesn&amp;apos;t the author tell the reader about the sexual identities of his or her characters?  How this omission significant?
* What aspects of the work has the author silenced or closeted, in order to gain the approval of society?

A traditional work of literature can be &amp;quot;queered&amp;quot; by applying this type of interpretation.
