&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quintus Antistius Labeo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pacuvius Antistius Labeo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, died 42 BC) was an [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[jurist]].

He was one of those disciples of [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]], who are stated by [[Pomponius]] to have written books which were digested by [[Aufidius Namusa]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Pomponius]], Dig. 1. tit. 2. s. 2. ยง 44 (cited by Graves)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  He was the father of the more eminent jurist [[Marcus Antistius Labeo]], who lived under Augustus.

In his attachment to the ancient republican liberty, he joined the conspiracy of [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and was one of the murderers of [[Julius Caesar]]. Constant to the party he had espoused, he was present at the [[Battle of Philippi]], and, after the defeat, was unwilling to survive Brutus, who, he was told, had pronounced his name with a sigh before his death. Having dug in his tent a hole of the length of his body, he settled his worldly affairs, and sent messages to his wife and children. Then, taking the hand of his most faithful slave, he turned him round (as was usual in the ceremony of [[manumission]]), and, giving him his sword, presented his throat to be stabbed, and was buried in his tent in the hole which he had dug.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Schol. ad Horat. Sat. i. 3. 83; Plut. Brut. 12; Appian, B. C. iv. 135. (cited by Graves)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
