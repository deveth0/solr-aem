&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen Anne Cottage and Coach Barn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[National Register of Historic Places]] structure (site #80000804) and a [[California Historical Landmark]] (#367) on the grounds of the [[Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden]] in [[Arcadia, California]].  It was placed on the Register in 1980 for its significance as an example of [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne Style architecture]] and for the associated, largely intact Victorian landscape.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | title =California - Los Angeles County | work =National Register of Historic Places | publisher =National Park Service | url =http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/ca/Los+Angeles/state7.html | accessdate =2008-01-07}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The Cottage was constructed in 1885-1886 for [[Lucky Baldwin|Elias Jackson &amp;quot;Lucky&amp;quot; Baldwin]] and his fourth wife, Lillie Bennett, the daughter of the Cottage&amp;apos;s architect Albert A. Bennett.  Upon E.J.&amp;apos;s death in 1909, his daughter Anita closed the Cottage and disposed of all furnishings.  Some of the architectural elements of the Cottage, such as the stained glass windows, black walnut doors, and marble fireplace mantels were stored in the coach barn.  The stored items were reinstalled in the Cottage during the 1951-1953 restoration.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | title =Tour the Queen Anne Cottage | work =Los Angeles County Arboretum &amp;amp; Botanic Garden | url =http://www.arboretum.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=getFrontPageFeature&amp;amp;FeatureID=80a9b6c5-5f83-11d6-a274-00d0b76949cb | accessdate =2008-01-07}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The Cottage has been used for numerous films and television shows, most famously for the opening of [[Fantasy Island]] where the character of Tattoo can be seen ringing the bell in the cottage&amp;apos;s tower and Mr. Roarke is seen exiting from it.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | title =TV Locations | work =Seeing Stars | url =http://www.seeing-stars.com/Locations/TVlocations3.shtml | accessdate =2008-01-07}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1993 the &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;-pattern fencing around the Queen Anne Cottage was refurbished and repaired as part of an Eagle Scout project by Erik Wanson, a member of Boy Scout Troop 351 in San Marino, California.
