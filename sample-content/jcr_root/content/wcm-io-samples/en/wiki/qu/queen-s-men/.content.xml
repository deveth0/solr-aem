The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen&amp;apos;s Men&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an Elizabethan [[playing company]] that operated between 1583 and 1595. It was a popular company and its [[patron]] was [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. Among its actors was the famous clown [[Richard Tarlton]].

The Queen&amp;apos;s Men appear to have been formed at the request of [[Francis Walsingham]] partially in order to regularize the London acting companies (Chambers, 2.104-5); it is also possible that the court wished to protect the most successful players from the hostility of city officials (Gurr, 32).

The actors for the Queen&amp;apos;s Men were drawn from already-existing companies such as the [[Earl of Leicester]]&amp;apos;s Men.  They included, in addition to Tarleton, [[Robert Wilson (dramatist)|Robert Wilson]] and John Laneham (both from Leicester&amp;apos;s Men), as well as John Dutton, John Bentley, and John Singer.

In 2006 there was a Shakespeare and the Queen&amp;apos;s Men theatre project at the [[University of Toronto]], with an accompanying conference, publications, and performance.  The [http://thequeensmen.ca Performing the Queen&amp;apos;s Men website] was launched in 2008.  It includes videos from SQM productions of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;King Leir&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Famous Victories&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Friar Bacon &amp;amp; Friar Bungay&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; interviews with actors; information about the history of the Queen&amp;apos;s Men; and articles about the research-creation process.
