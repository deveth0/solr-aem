He supported [[Pope Symmachus]] in the schism over the Popes&amp;apos; election, and was executed with his son-in-law [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]] after being charged with treason.

== Biography ==
He belonged to the [[Symmachi]], one of the richest and most influential senatorial families in Rome; his father, [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus (consul 446)|Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]], had been consul in 446. Memmius Symmachus had three daughters (Rusticiana, [[Galla of Rome|Galla]] and Proba) and adopted the young Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius when his father died; later Boethius married Rusticiana, and the couple had two sons, [[Symmachus (consul 522)|Symmachus]] and [[Boethius (consul 522)|Boethius]], both consuls in 522. Memmius Symmachus civil offices included being appointed sole consul for 485, the third known member of his family to hold this office.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The first was his great-grandfather, [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]] in 391.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Although Symmachus was the head of a family with a long connection with Pagan tradition—his grandfather [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]] delivered a famous speech urging the return of the [[Altar of Victory]] to the [[Curia Julia|Roman Senate House]] -- he was an ardent Christian,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Both his daughters took religious vows.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; interested both in theological disputes and, more prosaically, in the struggles for the control of the Pope; during and after the disputed election of Pope Symmachus, he and [[Anicius Probus Faustus Niger]] were the only two Senators known to support the pope against his more popular rival, [[Antipope Laurentius|Laurentius]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Susan T. Stevens, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/27831119 &amp;quot;The Circle of Bishop Fulgentius&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos; Traditio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;38&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1982), p. 338&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Symmachus cultivated the ancient Roman culture, writing a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Roman history&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in seven volumes; this work has been lost except for a section quoted by [[Jordanes]] in his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Getica&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Symmachus&amp;apos; wealth enabled his [[patronage]]: he was involved in publication of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Commentarii in Somnium Scipionis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius]], and there is even a copy of the work corrected by his hand.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aurelius Memmius Symmachus v.c. emendabam vel distinguebam meum Ravennae cum Macrobio Plotino Euexodio&amp;apos;&amp;apos; -- &amp;quot;I, Aurelius Memmius Symmachus, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[vir clarissimus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, corrected and put punctuation to my copy in Ravenna together with Macrobius Plotinus Euxodius, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;vir clarissimus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; (Hedrick, Charles W., &amp;apos;&amp;apos;History and Silence&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, University of Texas Press, 2000, ISBN 0-292-73121-3, p. 183)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

For the most part, Symmachus maintained good relationships with the new rulers of Italy—both [[Odovacer]] and [[Theodoric the Great]] -- demonstrated by his appointment as  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[praefectus urbi]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; between 476 and 491, consul in 485, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Patrikios|patricius]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; within 510, and even reaching the influential rank of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;caput senatus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (president of the Senate). His visit to [[Constantinople]], after which [[Priscian]] dedicated him some poems, was likely on behalf of king Theodoric. However, Symmachus contradicted the Ostrogothic king, who condemned him to death for treason in 526, one year after the execution of Boethius.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Boethius, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Consolation of Philosophy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, trad.
