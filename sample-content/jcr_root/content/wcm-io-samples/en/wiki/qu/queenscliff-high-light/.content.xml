The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queenscliff High Light&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also variously known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Black Lighthouse&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fort Queenscliff Lighthouse&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shortland Bluff Light&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, stands in the grounds of [[Fort Queenscliff]] in [[Queenscliff, Victoria|Queenscliff]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].  It is one of three black [[lighthouse]]s in the world, and the only one in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Together with the nearby white [[Queenscliff Low Light]], it was built in 1862 to replace the former sandstone lighthouse of 1843 on the same site which was underpowered and deteriorating.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Lighth Inc.&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite loa|VIC|Queenscliff%20Black|The Black Lighthouse at Fort Queenscliff|url3=Black%20Lighthouse%20Queenscliff}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The lightsource is located 40 metres above sea level ([[focal plane]]). Depending on the tower&amp;apos;s [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] it emits either a fixed light or an occulting signal with an interval of 15 seconds. The black lighthouse is one of four in Queenscliff that are used as a [[Leading lights|leading line]] to guide ships through the notoriously dangerous mouth of [[Port Phillip|Port Phillip Bay]].&amp;lt;ref name=Rowlett&amp;gt;{{cite rowlett|vic}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
There are two conflicting legends about where the [[bluestone]] for the building came from.  One version states that it came from [[Scotland]] as a ships ballast.  In the other more likely version, the stone was quarried in Melbourne and shipped to Queenscliff.  The fact that the stone was shipped may have led to the former theory&amp;apos;s conception.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Lighth Inc.&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

[[Fort Queenscliff]] was built around the lighthouse during the [[Victorian Gold Rush|Australian Gold Rush]] after concerns that ships carrying gold might be susceptible to attack from [[privateer]]s.  The light was converted to gas in 1890, and then to electricity in 1924. It is supposed that the first [[payphone|public telephone]] service in Victoria was installed here.  Today the lighthouse is unmanned and [[Lighthouse#Automation|automated]], and is serviced by the [[Port of Melbourne Corporation]].

==Reference to The Lighthouse==
In [[Henry Handel Richardson|Henry Handel Richardson&amp;apos;s]] classic book,  &amp;quot;[[The Getting of Wisdom]]&amp;quot; a vivid description is given of a ferry trip that bypasses the lighthouse in the late 1800s.
&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3728/3728-h/3728-h.htm The Getting of Wisdom by Henry Handel Richardson. Chapter XIX ]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Then the boat stood to sea again and sailed past high, grass-grown cliffs, from which a few old cannons, pointing their noses at you, watched over the safety of the Bayâ€”in the event, say, of the Japanese or the Russians entering the Heads past the pretty township, and the beflagged bathing-enclosures on the beach below. They neared the tall, granite lighthouse at the point, with the flagstaff at its side where incoming steamers were signalled; and as soon as they had rounded this corner they were in view of the Heads themselves. From the distant cliffs there ran out, on either side, brown reefs, which made the inrushing water dance and foam, and the entrance to the Bay narrow and dangerous: on one side, there projected the portion of a wreck which had lain there as long as Laura had been in the world. Then, having made a sharp turn to the left, the boat crossed to the opposite coast, and steamed past barrack-like buildings lying asleep in the fierce sunshine of the afternoon; and, in due course, it stopped at Laura&amp;apos;s destination.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
