&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Cambridgeshire]], [[England]], is a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in [[the Fens]] about {{Convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]].  The [[River Great Ouse]] passes through it.

Close to the village is the junction of the [[Fen Line|Fen]], [[Breckland Line|Breckland]] and [[Ely to Peterborough Line|Ely to Peterborough]] railway lines. Consequently, three lines (and one of them twice, as there is a [[Balloon loop|loop]]!) pass through the village and cross the [[B1382 (road)|B1382]], meaning there are three [[level crossing]]s and one railway bridge in quick succession.
