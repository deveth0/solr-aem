        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quiet Sun&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were an [[England|English]] [[progressive rock]]/[[jazz fusion]] [[Band (music)|band]] from the [[Canterbury scene|Canterbury Scene]] consisting of [[Phil Manzanera]] (guitars), [[Bill MacCormick]] (bass), Dave Jarrett (keyboards) and [[Charles Hayward (musician)|Charles Hayward]] (drums).

==History==
Having originated from a Dulwich College band by the name of Pooh and the Ostrich Feather,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;allmusic-manzanera&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Allmusic|id=p4839|label=Phil Manzanera biography}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Quiet Sun was formed in 1970 after MacCormick had made friends with [[Robert Wyatt]],&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;allen_jones&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Wayback|url=http://www.manzanera.com/QuietSunarticles2.htm#Jones|title=Quiet Sun Interviews and Articles No.&amp;amp;nbsp;2: Allan Jones, Melody Maker|date=20070313061947}} from manzanera.com&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; the son of a friend of his mother&amp;apos;s.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;allmusic-maccormick&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Allmusic|id=p100390|label=Bill MacCormick biography}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The band integrated jazz elements and sparkling keyboard sounds into their complex music - similar to [[Soft Machine]] - but Manzanera&amp;apos;s energetic guitar made their music very different from the Softs&amp;apos; who had not been using any guitar (other than [[bass guitar]]) on their regular albums before the 1975 release of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bundles (album)|Bundles]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and had used reeds as the main other melody instruments aside of keyboards.

Quiet Sun split up in 1972, Manzanera to [[Roxy Music]], MacCormick to [[Matching Mole]], Hayward to [[This Heat]], and Jarrett began to teach mathematics.

In 1975, Manzanera booked a studio for 26 days to record his album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Diamond Head&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and got Quiet Sun together again to record an album from their old composed material in the studio at the same time.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;presspack&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Wayback|url=http://www.manzanera.com/QuietSunPR.htm#Press|title=Quiet Sun Press Pack|date=20080521030243}} from manzanera.com&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This first and only album of theirs, with participation of [[Brian Eno]] and the late [[Ian MacDonald|Ian MacCormick]], titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Mainstream (Quiet Sun album)|Mainstream]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was critically acclaimed and became the [[New Musical Express]]&amp;apos; album of the month. One of Quiet Sun&amp;apos;s songs appears on [[Robert Wyatt]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, under the name &amp;quot;Team Spirit&amp;quot;. Additionally, reworked versions of &amp;quot;Rongwrong&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Mummy was an asteroid, Daddy was a small non-stick kitchen utensil&amp;quot; both appear on the album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[801 Live]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the latter is consolidated with a track from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Diamond Head&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;East of Echo&amp;quot;, with the result titled &amp;quot;East of Asteroid&amp;quot;).
