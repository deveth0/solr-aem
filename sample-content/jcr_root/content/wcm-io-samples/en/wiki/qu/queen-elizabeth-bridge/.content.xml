The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen Elizabeth Bridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a road bridge just to the west of the town of [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], [[Berkshire]], [[England]].

The Elizabeth bridge carries the [[A332 road|A332]] Windsor By-pass across the [[River Thames]], on the reach between [[Romney Lock]] and [[Boveney Lock]]. The bridge was completed in 1966, and has formed the principal road route between the adjacent towns of Windsor and [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] since 1970, when structural cracks in the central [[Windsor Bridge]] forced that bridge&amp;apos;s closure to all but [[pedestrian]] traffic,
