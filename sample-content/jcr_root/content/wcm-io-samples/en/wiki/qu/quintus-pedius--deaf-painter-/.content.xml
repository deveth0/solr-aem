|quote=Q. Pedius ... had a grandson, who being dumb from his birth, the orator Messala, to whose family his grandmother belonged, recommended he should be brought up as a painter, a proposal which was also approved of by the late Emperor Augustus. He died, however, in his youth, after having made great progress in the art.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Pedius was the son of Roman Senator and orator [[Quintus Pedius Publicola]], while his mother was an unnamed Roman woman. Pedius&amp;apos; paternal grandfather was the consul [[Quintus Pedius]] and his paternal grandmother was Valeria, a relative (sister?) of Roman Senator and orator [[Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus]]. His paternal grandfather and [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]] were maternal cousins.

Pedius was born [[deafness|deaf]]. On the advice of his paternal great uncle (?) Messalla Corvinus, and with permission from Augustus, Pedius was taught to paint. The boy turned out to be a talented painter, but died in his youth.
