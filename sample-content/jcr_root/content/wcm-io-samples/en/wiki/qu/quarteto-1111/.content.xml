&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quarteto 1111&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was founded in 1967 in Estoril and is one of the most influential [[progressive rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]]  bands in [[Portugal]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Originally formed by Miguel Artur da Silveira (Drums), [[José Cid]] (Vocals and Keyboard), António Moniz Pereira (Guitar) and Jorge Moniz Pereira (Bass). Latter members included [[Tozé Brito]] and [[Mike Sargent]].

It was one of the many musical groups inspired in [[The Shadows]]. Originally called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mystery Group (Conjunto Mistério)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the name later changed to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;1111 Quartet (Quarteto 1111)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The name was inspired by phone number of the band&amp;apos;s rehearsal place, at the drummer&amp;apos;s house.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quarteto 1111&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the first [[symphonic rock]] band in Portugal. Since 1968-69 they got media attention through a hit single, &amp;quot;El Rei D. Sebastião&amp;quot;, actually with lyrics about the theme of the lost Portuguese king, who supposedly died in the fields of Morocco during the battle of [[Alcácer-Quibir]] (a loss that would eventually lead to Portugal losing its independence to Spain). All the myths related with the return of [[King Sebastian]] — a quite anchored Portuguese [[myth]] — were fairly treated in this song. The [[harpsichord]] made its first appearance in [[Portuguese rock]] music. A single with the English version of the song was published in Great Britain. José Cid was the band leader, composer, keyboard player and lead singer. The rest of the band had a classic formation influenced by the usual [[Beatles]] line-up, but with a sound and song structure that reminds the early [[Moody Blues]]. The following album continued in the same vein, combining melodic songs with newly progressive instruments, namely the [[Mellotron]]. Later on the band evolved to late 1970s pop sound.

The band (with Michel, Tozé Brito and Mike Sargent) briefly reunited in 24 November 2007, during a José Cid show, where the rest of the band joined him onstage and played four songs from their work.
