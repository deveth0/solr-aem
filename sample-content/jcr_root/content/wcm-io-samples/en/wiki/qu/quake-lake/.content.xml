&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quake Lake&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (officially &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earthquake Lake&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[lake]] in southwestern [[Montana]] in the [[United States]]. It was created after an [[earthquake]] struck on August 17, 1959, killing 28 people.&amp;lt;ref name=usgs&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Largest Earthquake in Montana|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/events/1959_08_18.php|work=Historic Earthquakes|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2012-04-01|date=October 21, 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Today, Quake Lake is {{convert|190|ft}} deep and {{convert|6|mi}} long. [[US 287]] follows the lake and offers glimpses of the effects of the earthquake and landslide and visitor center is just off the road. The lake is mostly within [[Gallatin National Forest]].

==The earthquake==
{{main|1959 Yellowstone earthquake}}

The earthquake measured 7.5 on the [[Richter scale]] (revised by USGS to 7.3) and caused an 80-million ton [[landslide]], which formed a [[landslide dam]] on the [[Madison River]]. The earthquake was the most powerful to hit the state of Montana in historic times. The landslide traveled down the south flank of Sheep Mountain, at an estimated {{convert|100|mph}}, killing 28 people who were camping along the shores of Hebgen Lake and downstream along the Madison River.  Upstream the faulting caused by the earthquake forced the waters of [[Hebgen Lake]] to shift violently. A [[seiche]], a wave effect of both [[wind]] and [[water]], crested over [[Hebgen Dam]], causing cracks and erosion.

The earthquake created [[Geologic fault|fault scarps]] up to {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} high in the area near Hebgen Lake and the lake bottom itself dropped the same distance. {{convert|32000|acres|km2|abbr=on}} of the area near Hebgen Lake subsided more than {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Several [[geysers]] in the northwestern sections in [[Yellowstone National Park]] erupted and numerous hot springs became temporarily muddied.&amp;lt;ref name=usgs/&amp;gt;

Within the immediate vicinity of the earthquake and resultant landslide, a few dozen cabins and homes were destroyed. Overall damages to buildings and roads were minor with damage costs placed at 11 million [[United States dollar|dollars]] in 1959. [[Aftershock]]s up to 6.5 on the Richter scale continued for several months.&amp;lt;ref name=usgs/&amp;gt;

==Hebgen Dam and creation of the lake==
[[Hebgen Dam]], built in 1917, is a [[concrete]] core and rock fill faced structure that sustained severe damage but continued to hold. Repairs were completed on the dam spillway in a few weeks. The landslide, which occurred downstream from the dam, blocked almost all the flow of the Madison River which began to fill in the void upstream from the slide. In less than a month, the waters had created what is now known as Quake Lake. The lack of a reliable water outlet for this new lake forced one of the largest mobilizations of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] ever commenced in the western U.S. Before the new landslide was breached by the quickly rising waters, a [[spillway]] was constructed to ensure erosion and potential failure of the natural dam would be minimized.
