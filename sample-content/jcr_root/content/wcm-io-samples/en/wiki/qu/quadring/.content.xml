The local school is the Quadring Cowley and Brown&amp;apos;s primary school.

Previously Quadring had two [[public house]]s, a butcher, fishmonger, blacksmith, a slaughterhouse, and several pig farms. However today all that remains is a village store (that serves as a post office) and a public house, The White Hart, on Town Drove.
