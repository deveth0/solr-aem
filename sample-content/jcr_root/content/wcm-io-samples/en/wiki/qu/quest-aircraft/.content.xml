&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quest Aircraft Company&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an American aircraft manufacturing company located in [[Sandpoint, Idaho]]. Quest was started in 2001 to design and provide aircraft suitable for domestic and international humanitarian applications.
==History==
Paul Schaller became CEO of the company in 2004, and by 2009 the employment force was 340 persons.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |last=Namowitz |first=Dan |url=http://www.aopa.org/aircraft/articles/2011/110610quest_aircraft_ceo_to_depart_other_changes_announced.html |title=Quest Aircraft CEO to Depart; Other Changes Announced |publisher=Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association |work=AOPA - Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association |date=2011-06-10 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Following a soft economy, in 2010 the workforce was reduced down to 155 employees, but 2011 saw a fresh infusion of capital and a change in executive leadership as Schaller migrated to a consulting role in the company.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?do=main.textpost&amp;amp;id=b57190da-ac4f-4ab1-b867-966e1f9d8866 |author=&amp;lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&amp;gt; |title=Changes: Quest Aircraft Shifts Management, Shows Progress |work=Aero-News Network |date=2011-06-12 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
