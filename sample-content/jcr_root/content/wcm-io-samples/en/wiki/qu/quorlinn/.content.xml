In many [[campaign setting]]s for the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quorlinn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the [[kenku]] deity of trickery, disguise, and thievery. His symbol is a mask with a large false nose.

==Publication history==
Quorlinn was first detailed in the book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Monster Mythology]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1992), including details about his priesthood.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Carl Sargent|Sargent, Carl]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Monster Mythology]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (TSR, 1992)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; His role in the cosmology of the [[Planescape]] campaign setting was described in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[On Hallowed Ground]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1996).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Colin McComb|McComb, Colin]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[On Hallowed Ground]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1996)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Description==
Quorlinn appears as a typical [[kenku]] wearing a black mask and fairly nondescript clothing. Quorlinn is a likable, roguish trickster. He has a tinge of malice about him at times, but he has also aided races other than his own. He spends much of his time whining about the responsibilities imposed upon him by a race he did not choose to have created in his image.

==Relationships==
Quorlinn is portrayed as the botched creation of a powerful non-lawful sky-god too embarrassed to admit his error. Quorlinn proved his worthiness in a series of wild and dubious adventures involving his present areas of concern, and in reward the deity created the kenku to keep him busy (much to Quorlinn&amp;apos;s dismay).

Quorlinn&amp;apos;s relationship with [[Pazuzu (Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons)|Pazuzu]], who is said to have transformed the kenku into their present humanoid form in order to save them from a suspicious plague, is unknown.

==Realm==
Quorlinn&amp;apos;s realm of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Filchnest&amp;apos;&amp;apos; can be found on the plane of the [[Beastlands]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

==Dogma==
Quorlinn teaches disguise, magic, and thievery to help the kenku survive, for he fears he is too weak to protect them himself.

==Worshipers==
Quorlinn is worshiped mainly by kenku.

===Clergy===
Quorlinn&amp;apos;s shamans and priests are devious and clever, masterminding abductions, ambushes, and traps. They are organized into secretive cells, and often serve as spies. They work to break other kenku out of jails and prisons.
