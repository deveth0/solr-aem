&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen Margaret College&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an independent Presbyterian all-girls high school/college in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]. The school was started in 1919 at 53 Hobson Street, [[Thorndon]], Wellington. It was previously the location of [[Scots College, Wellington]], now the school&amp;apos;s brother school. The land currently occupied by the school was previously occupied by Māori from the Pipitea Marae. Over the last 85 years, QMC has grown to over 600 students from Preps to year 13 and employs around 90 staff.

The School&amp;apos;s namesake is [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Queen Margaret]], who was married to King [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm]]. He features in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Macbeth]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, being one of [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan]]&amp;apos;s sons, who flees after his father was murdered.

Students are organized into five houses - [[Berwick Castle|Berwick]] (blue &amp;amp; silver), [[Braemar]] (blue &amp;amp; yellow), [[Glamis Castle|Glamis]] (red &amp;amp; blue), [[Loch Leven Castle|Lochleven]] (red, green and black), and [[Stirling Castle|Stirling]] (black &amp;amp; yellow). They are named after castles in [[Scotland]], a nod towards the Scottish heritage upon which the school was built.
