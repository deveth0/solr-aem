The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queens Gardens&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[heritage-listed]] park located on a city block between [[George Street, Brisbane|George Street]], [[Elizabeth Street, Brisbane|Elizabeth Street]] and [[William Street, Brisbane|William Street]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]]. [[Australia]]. On the opposite side of William Street is the old [[State Library of Queensland]] and on the opposite side of Elizabeth Street is the former [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]] (now [[Conrad Treasury Casino]]).

Queens Gardens was established in its present form in 1963, after the buildings which had occupied the area had been demolished.  Queens Gardens was named in honour of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. A statue of Queen Victoria, based on an original in [[Portsmouth, England|Portsmouth]] and created by English sculptor [[Thomas Brock]], was unveiled in 1906 in the gardens in front of the [[Lands Administration Building]].&amp;lt;ref name=thenandnow&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=Brisbane Then and Now |last=Gregory |first=Helen  |year=2007 |publisher=Salamander Books |location=Wingfield, South Australia |isbn=978-1-74173-011-1 |pages=26–27 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Also in the gardens is a statue of [[T. J. Ryan]], [[Premier of Queensland]] (1915–1919), and a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] memorial.

As an early penal colony the site was originally home to a cottage, lumber yard, engineer&amp;apos;s store and workshops.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;thenandnow&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
