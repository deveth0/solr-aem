&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quenton Harold Leach&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 20 August 1972) is a former [[Australian rules football]]er who played for the [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle Dockers]] between 1995 and 1998. He was drafted from [[Claremont Football Club|Claremont]] in the [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]] as a foundation selection in the [[1994 AFL Draft]] and played mainly as a defender.

Leach played most of his football in the backline, but is best remembered for kicking a goal after the siren to win a game against Brisbane in 1997.  Fremantle were behind by 1 point when Leach took a mark about 30 metres from goal, just seconds before the siren sounded to end the game.  His kick after the siren went straight through the goals and Fremantle won the game by 5 points.
