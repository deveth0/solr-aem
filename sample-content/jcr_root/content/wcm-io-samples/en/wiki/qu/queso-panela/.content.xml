&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queso panela&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (panela [[cheese]]), also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;queso canasta&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;queso de la canasta&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (basket cheese) because it carries the impression of the basket in which it is molded, is a white, fresh and smooth cheese of [[Pasteurization|pasteurized]] [[cow&amp;apos;s milk]], served most often as part of appetizer dishes such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[nopal]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[salads]] or [[quesadillas]].  It is derived from the Greek word for [[basket cheese]]. The cheese also has similarities to the [[India]]n cheese &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[paneer]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;gs&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-10-15|publisher=Gourmet Sleuth|title=Guide to Mexican Cheeses|url=http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/mexicancheeses.htm}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

It absorbs other flavors easily and is covered at times with a paste of [[garlic]] and [[chili pepper]]. Good, genuine, fresh panela inhabits a similar watery environment to mozzarella, and can be used in quite the same fashion.  It may also be fried, although it holds its shape and does not melt very easily.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;gs&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  It is used in many diverse [[Mexican food]]s, such as [[enchiladas]] or [[tacos]],&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;gs&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; as well as in some variant preparations of [[guacamole]].

Regional differences as well as different degrees of [[cheese ripening|maturation]] yield a diverse variety of cheeses within the panela family. One remarkable regional variety is that of the evergreen mountain town Tapalpa.
