&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quality Records&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a Canadian entertainment company which released music albums in Canada on behalf of American record labels, and also released recordings by Canadian artists. The company operated between 1950 and 1985, and from 1990 to 1997.

==History==

[[Bobby Gimby]]&amp;apos;s song &amp;quot;[[Canada (song)|Canada]]&amp;quot; as sung by the Young Canada Singers was released in 1967 as a 45 rpm single by Quality on behalf of Canada&amp;apos;s Centennial Commission.

[[Stompin&amp;apos; Tom Connors]]&amp;apos; recordings made by CKGB radio in 1967 were pressed by Quality Records and distributed by Connors himself.

The company won in the category of Best Company for Canadian Content at the [[Gold Leaf Awards of 1970]] and the [[Juno Awards of 1971]].

In the mid-80s, Quality Records replaced [[K-tel International]] as a distributor of various artist compilations in Canada, most notably with the Rock year series (Rock &amp;apos;85, Rock &amp;apos;86, etc.) and &amp;apos;This is Music&amp;apos; series.

It closed down in 1985. However, in 1990, it revived as Quality Music &amp;amp; Video for new recordings, notably [[Dan Hill]]&amp;apos;s 1991 album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dance of Love&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and [[Timmy T|Timmy T&amp;apos;s]] number 1 pop hit [[One More Try (Timmy T song)|One More Try]]. However, it folded again in 1997 &amp;amp; its catalog number was sold to [[Warlock Records]], a New York-based record label that acquired the catalog numbers of [[Sleeping Bag Records]].

In the 90&amp;apos;s Quality Records along with [[MuchMusic]] put out the Dance Mix series from 1990-1997. When Quality Records folded in 1997, the Dance Mix series was rebranded [[MuchDance]].
