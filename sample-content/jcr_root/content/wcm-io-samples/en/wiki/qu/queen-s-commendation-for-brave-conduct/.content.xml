Instituted in 1939 by King George VI as the King&amp;apos;s Commendation for Brave Conduct, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen&amp;apos;s Commendation for Brave Conduct&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; acknowledged brave acts by civilians and members of the military in non-warlike circumstances during a time of war or in peacetime where the action would not otherwise be recognised by an existing award. In 1954 it became the Queen&amp;apos;s Commendation for Brave Conduct. The award was replaced in 1994 by the [[Queen&amp;apos;s Commendation for Bravery]]

There is no entitlement to [[Post-nominal letters|post-nominals]].

==Description==
* There is no ribbon, but the award was evidenced by a certificate and at first by a gold and red coloured badge bearing the design of a sword in a wreath, surmounted by a crown.
* The badge was replaced at a later stage by another badge - in the form a silver laurel leaf for civilians and a bronze oak leaf for the military equivalent, the [[Mentioned in Despatches|Mention in Despatches]] - the leaves being attached to the ribbon of the War Medal or Defence Medal if held by the recipient, or appropriate campaign medal in other circumstances.
