&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Qutb-ud-din Aibak&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ar|{{Nastaliq|قطب الدين أيبك}}}}, {{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|قطب الدین ایبک}}}}; lit. &amp;quot;Axis of the Faith&amp;quot;) was a Turkic king of Northwest India who ruled from his capital in [[Delhi]] where he built the [[Qutub Minar]] and the [[Qutb complex|Quwwat Al Islam mosque]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Francis Robinson, The Mughal Emperors and the Islamic Dynasties of India, Iran and Central Asia, Page 77&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was of Turkic descent from central Asia(modern day Aybak, [[Samangan]], Afghanistan), the first [[Sultanate of Delhi|Sultan of Delhi]] and founder of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Delhi)|Ghulam dynasty]] (Mamluk Sultanate) of India. He ruled for only four years, from 1206 to 1210 AD. He died while playing [[polo]] in [[Lahore]].&amp;lt;ref name=imp&amp;gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V02_403.gif Dynastic Chart] [[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]], v. 2, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;p. 368.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Qutb-ud-din Aibak ruled for four years until he had a fatal accident while playing &amp;apos;&amp;apos;chaugan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (polo). His horse fell and he was impaled on the pommel of his saddle.  His early death prevented him completing his plans for organizing his kingdom and establishing a sound administration. He built the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque in Delhi&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Mark M. Jarzombek, Vikramaditya Prakash, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Global History of Architecture&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (Wiley, 2010), [http://books.google.com/books?id=HL2I_t_ZyQoC&amp;amp;pg=PT1057&amp;amp;dq=mosque+Qutub+Aibak+Quwwat-ul-Islam&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=qYmOUY-OLYKNrgG8l4HoAg&amp;amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBDgK]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and the Adhai-din-ka-Jhonpra mosque in Ajmer.
He started the construction of [[Qutb Minar]] in Delhi, which is dedicated to a famous Sufi Saint of the time, [[Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki]]. After he died, the [[minar]] was completed by his successor, [[Iltutmish]]. He is also remembered as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;lakhbaksh&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or giver of [[lakhs]], because of his generosity.
