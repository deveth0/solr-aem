        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Qutb ad-Din Mawdud&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (died 6 September 1170) was the [[Zengid dynasty|Zengid]] [[List of Emirs of Mosul|Emir of Mosul]] from  1149 to 1169. He was a brother and successor of [[Saif ad-Din Ghazi I]].

==Biography==
At the death of [[Zangi]], his possessions were divided between his sons: [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]] received [[Aleppo]] and Saif ad-Din Ghazi [[Mosul]], while Qutb ad-Din Mawdud received the emirate of [[Homs]]. After the death of Saif ad-Din Ghazi in 1149, Qutb ad-Din Mawdud was the first to arrive in Mosul, being able to have himself recognized as emir; Nur ad-Din, who desired to add the city to his lands, occupied Homs and [[Sinjar]], preparing to attack his brother. Only the intervetion of veterans of the Aleppo army, who refused to take part in the fratricide war which would weaken the effort against the Crusaders and the [[emirate of Damascus]], forced Nur ad-Din to renounce to the expedition and to reconcile with his brother.

In 1164, [[Shirkuh]], a general of Nur ad-Din, fought King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] for the control of [[Egypt]]. When he found himself in a weak situation, Nur ad-Din launched an expedition against the [[Principality of Antioch]] to divert the Christian forces. The [[Artuqid]] emirs of [[Mardin]] and [[Diyarbakır]], as well as Mawdud, joined him in the attack, which turned to be successful: the towns of [[Harim]] and [[Banias]] were captured, and Amalric had to abandon Egypt. For the same reason, Mawdud helped his brother in the [[County of Tripoli]] in 1167.

At the beginning of 1168, [[Kara Arslan]], the Artuqid emir of [[Hasankeyf]], died, and Qutb ad-Din Mawdud tried to conquer that city; but he was pushed back by Nur ad-Din, who had promised to defend Arslan&amp;apos;s successors.

Qutb ad-Din Mawdud died in September 1170. He had designed as successor his second son [[Ghazi II Saif ud-Din]].
