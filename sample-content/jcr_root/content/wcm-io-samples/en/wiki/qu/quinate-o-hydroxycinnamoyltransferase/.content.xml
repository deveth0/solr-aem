In [[enzymology]], a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;quinate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{EC number|2.3.1.99}}) is an [[enzyme]] that [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the [[chemical reaction]]

:feruloyl-CoA + quinate &amp;lt;math&amp;gt;\rightleftharpoons&amp;lt;/math&amp;gt; CoA + O-feruloylquinate

Thus, the two [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] of this enzyme are [[feruloyl-CoA]] and [[quinate]], whereas its two [[product (chemistry)|products]] are [[coenzyme A|CoA]] and [[O-feruloylquinate]].

This enzyme belongs to the family of [[transferase]]s, specifically those [[acyltransferase]]s transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;feruloyl-CoA:quinate O-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This enzyme is also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hydroxycinnamoyl coenzyme A-quinate transferase&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  This enzyme participates in [[phenylpropanoid biosynthesis]].
