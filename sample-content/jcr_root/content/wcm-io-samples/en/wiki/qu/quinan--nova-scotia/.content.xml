&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quinan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (located on Highway 308) is a small French [[Acadian]] village in [[Yarmouth County]], [[Nova Scotia]], about 20 minutes inland from the town of [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]] and has approximately 320 inhabitants. This village is named after Father [[John J. Quinan]], of Irish descent, who served as parish priest from 1860 - 1867. It used to be called &amp;quot;The Forks&amp;quot;, in plural, because the Tusket River, which passes through the village stretches out in three branches, the Upper Tusket River, the Lower Tusket River and the Quinan River.

Every year, during the [[Labour Day]] weekend in September, the community welcomes people from everywhere for their Annual Labour Day Picnic. In 2008, Quinan celebrated its 125th Annual Picnic. There are activities like bingo, rose tables and rides.

Each Spring, the community hosts a Wild Game Evening that includes a supper and auction that attracts more people than can be served.
