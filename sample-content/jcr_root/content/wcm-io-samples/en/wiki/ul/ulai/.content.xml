        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ulai&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name for a [[river]] near the city of [[Susa]]. It is mentioned twice in the [[Bible]]:
*[[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 8:2 &amp;amp;ndash; &amp;quot;In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal.&amp;quot; ([[New International Version]])
*Daniel 8:16 &amp;amp;ndash; &amp;quot;And I heard a manâ€™s voice from the Ulai calling, &amp;apos;Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision.&amp;apos; &amp;quot;

There are three watercourses near Susa, and scholars are divided on which is indicated, although archaeology by [[William Loftus|Loftus]] in 1851 and [[Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy|Dieulafoy]] in 1885 helped shed some light. The Ulai may have been the eastern branch of the [[Karkheh River]] (alternately called the Choaspes or the Eulaus), which at one time divided into two branches some 20 miles north-west of the city.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=A dictionary of the Bible |editor1-first=Wiliam |editor1-last=Smith |year=1863 |location=London |volume=3 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KTtbAAAAQAAJ |page= 1300 |quote=it appears that the Choaspes (Kerkhah) originally bifurcated at Pai Pul, 20 miles above Susa, the right arm keeping its present course, while the left flowed a little to the east of Sus}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Another possible location of this river is the [[Dez River|Coprates]] tributary of the [[Karun River]]. Finally, some claim an artificial canal&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=The book of Daniel |editor1-last=Kirkpatrick |year=1900 |location=London |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YC82AAAAMAAJ |page= 112 |quote=the Eulaeus was a large artificial canal some 900 feet broad, of which traces remain, though it is now dry, which left the Choaspes at Pai Pul, about 20 miles N.-W. of Susa, passed close by the town of Susa on the N. or N.-E., and afterwards joined the Coprates}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; which ran close by Susa and connected the two rivers mentioned above.
