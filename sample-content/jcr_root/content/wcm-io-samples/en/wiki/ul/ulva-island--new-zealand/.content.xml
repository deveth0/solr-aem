&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ulva Island&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ( from {{lang-gd|Eilean na Ulbha}}) is a small [[island]] about {{convert|3.5|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} long lying within [[Paterson Inlet, New Zealand|Paterson Inlet]], which is part of [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]] in [[New Zealand]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;New Zealand Department of Conservation. 2008. [http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/PlaceProfile.aspx?id=35674 Ulva Island Open Sanctuary: Southern Islands places to visit]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It has an area of about {{convert|270|ha|acre}}, the majority of which is public land.  It was named after [[Ulva|Ulva Island]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]] of [[Scotland]], and was formerly called Coopers Island.

Ulva Island&amp;apos;s relative isolation, but easy access from Stewart Island has allowed it to become an important natural resource area. It is a sanctuary for both birds and plants, holding species that on the mainland of New Zealand are rare or have died out.  In 1997, the island was declared rat-free, following an eradication program, and [[Local extinction|extirpated]] birds have been reintroduced to the island. The birds include the [[Tieke|South Island saddleback]] (tieke), [[yellowhead (bird)|yellowhead]] (mohua) and [[New Zealand Robin|Stewart Island robin]] (toutouwai).  Other birds on the island that are rare on the mainland include the Stewart Island [[Brown Kiwi]] (tokoeka), [[Rifleman (bird)|Rifleman]] (Tītitipounamu), [[Yellow-crowned Parakeet|Yellow-crowned]] and [[Red-fronted Parakeet]], and South Island [[Kākā]] or forest parrot, as well as several other species. The [[endangered]] [[Yellow-eyed penguin]] uses the island for breeding sites.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=222 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yellow-eyed Penguin: Megadypes antipodes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Occasionally rats make their way to the island but are caught in a network of traps. In 2010 twelve rats were found on the island, including a juvenile indicating that there is now a breeding colony present.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://doc.govt.nz/about-doc/news/media-releases/rodents-invade-rat-free-ulva-island/|title=Rodents invade ‘rat-free’ Ulva Island|date=10 January 2011|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] currently maintains the public portion of the island including its predator free status.  A small portion of the island (approximately {{convert|8|ha|acre|0|disp=or}} between [[Sydney Cove (New Zealand)|Sydney Cove]] and Post Office Bay) is privately owned.
