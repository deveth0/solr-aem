&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ultra Large Format&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ULF) photography refers to [[photography]] using [[camera]]s producing [[Negative (photography)|negatives]] larger than 8x10&amp;quot; (20x25cm).

The ULF photography &amp;apos;movement&amp;apos; has known a revival in the last few years, and is still expanding, along with film photography which, despite the very large market share of [[digital photography]], still has many practitioners.

== Origins ==
In the 19th century and early 20th century, [[photographic material]]s were not sensitive enough to light to allow for enlarging. All prints were contact prints, which meant a large negative was needed if one wanted a large picture. This can only be achieved by using a large camera.

== Advantages ==
*The sheer size of the negative allows for very precise detail reproduction.
*Large negatives can be used to make [[contact print]]s, which is a method used with many alternative photographic processes.
*Images produced have a presence that is difficult to obtain through any other means - mostly the quality of a contact print instead of enlargement

==Trade-Offs==
*Very heavy and costly cameras
*Costly lenses with image coverage for large film sizes
*Film holders are custom built by fine wood workers - very costly
*High cost of film - most films must be special cut
*Cumbersome manipulation, which slows down the photographic process significantly
*Absence of international standards for film holders beyond 11&amp;quot; x 14&amp;quot; (30&amp;amp;nbsp;cm x 40&amp;amp;nbsp;cm) - this is rarely an issue as film holders are custom built to match cameras.
*Note that 14&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot; - the size of X-Ray and MRI films - is indeed an international standard.
