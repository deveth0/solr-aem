Zeb Aslam from comixfan.com rated the series 3.5 out of 5. The writing is considered &amp;quot;pretty lackluster and average at best&amp;quot; and that the writer Carey is using an &amp;quot;accepted formula&amp;quot; without taking any risks. The artwork was praised however &amp;quot;some panels the figures appear distorted&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | last = Aslam | first = Zeb | url=http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?p=885198 | title=Ultimate Elektra #1 Review | publisher=comixfan.com | accessdate=2008-07-21}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
