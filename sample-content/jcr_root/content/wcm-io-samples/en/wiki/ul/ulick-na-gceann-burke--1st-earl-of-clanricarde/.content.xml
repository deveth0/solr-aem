&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ulick na gCeann Burke&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (died 1544), 12th [[Clanricarde]] and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;1st Earl of Clanricarde&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (styled MacWilliam, and na-gCeann, meaning &amp;quot;of the Heads,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;having made a mount of the heads of men slain in battle which he covered up with earth&amp;quot;), was the son of [[Richard Mór Burke]] the 9th [[Clanricarde]].

==Biography==
Born to [[Richard Mór Burke]] by a daughter of Madden of Portumna, Ulick succeeded to the headship of his clan, and held vast estates in [[County Galway]].

In March 1541 he wrote to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], lamenting the degeneracy of his family, which had rebelled against [[England]] in the mid-14th century. The same year he was present at [[Dublin]], when an act was passed making [[Henry VIII]] [[King of Ireland]].

In 1543, in company with other Irish chiefs, he visited the King at [[Greenwich]] and made full submission in accordance with the King&amp;apos;s policy of &amp;quot;[[surrender and regrant]]&amp;quot;. He was confirmed in the captainship and rule of [[Clanricarde]], and on 1 July 1543, he was created [[Earl of Clanricarde]] and Baron of Dunkellin in the [[peerage of Ireland]]. He was regranted the greater part of his former estates, with the addition of other lands. The grant of the English titles was conditional upon the abandonment of native titles, the adoptation of English customs and laws, the pledging of allegiance to the English crown, [[apostasy]] from the Roman Catholic Church, and conversion to the [[Anglican Church]].

He did not live long to enjoy his new English dignities, but died shortly after returning to Ireland about March 1544. He is called by the [[annalist of Loch Cé]] &amp;quot;a haughty and proud lord,&amp;quot; who reduced many under his yoke, and by the Four Masters &amp;quot;the most illustrious of the English in Connaught.&amp;quot;

==Marriages==
Burke married three times, first to Grany or Grace, daughtor of Mulrone O&amp;apos;Carroll, by whom he had [[Richard Sassanach Burke, 2nd Earl of Clanricarde|Richard]], who eventually succeeded him as Second [[Earl of Clanricarde]].  This marriage was the only one declared valid.

He eventually divorced Grace and then married Honora, sister of Ulick de Burgh, but divorced her as well, marrying [[Maire Lynch]], by whom he had John, who claimed the earldom in 1568.

According the [[Burke&amp;apos;s Peerage]], he had several other sons, Thomas &amp;quot;the Athlete&amp;quot;, shot in 1545, Redmond &amp;quot;of the Broom&amp;quot;, died 1595, and Edmund, died 1597.

==Legacy==
As a result of his marriages and relationships there were a number of candidates contending for the titles of Clanricarde and Earl. The eventual successor was Ulick&amp;apos;s eldest legitimate son, [[Richard Sassanach Burke]], 2nd Earl of Clanricarde.
