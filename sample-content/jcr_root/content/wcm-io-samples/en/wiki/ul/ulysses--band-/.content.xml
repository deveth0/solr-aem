        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ulysses&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[indie rock]] [[musical band|band]] formed by [[Robert Schneider]] (lead vocalist of [[The Apples in Stereo]]) along with [[John Ferguson (musician)|John Ferguson]] and [[Ben Fulton]] in the [[spring (season)|spring]] of 2003. [[Robert Beatty]] (of [[Hair Police]]) joined later that year. They released their first album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[010 (Ulysses album)|010]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, on October 26, 2004 through [[Eenie Meenie Records]]. The album was released in mono.

==Band history==
While touring Spain with The Apples in stereo, Schneider was inspired to write &amp;quot;Push You Away&amp;quot;, the first song written for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;010&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Schneider began writing other songs for the album as well.

Schneider&amp;apos;s main influences for the band&amp;apos;s songs were [[The Velvet Underground]] and [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]].

In [[Lexington, Kentucky]], the band formed by impulse when Schneider invited Ferguson and Fulton to organize songs for Schneider&amp;apos;s other side project, [[Marbles (band)| Marbles]]. Schneider asked them to first play his set of 10 songs, and Ulysses was born. The band recorded the album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;010&amp;apos;&amp;apos; live in Schneider&amp;apos;s garage studio, in mono with the drums and amplifiers situated symmetrically around a single microphone. The album was released on Eenie Meenie Records.

In the process of writing and recording &amp;apos;&amp;apos;010&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Schneider&amp;apos;s marriage with Apples in Stereo bandmate [[Hilarie Sidney]] ended.
