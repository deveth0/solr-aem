&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ulricehamn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Urban areas in Sweden|locality]] and the seat of [[Ulricehamn Municipality]], [[Västra Götaland County]], [[Sweden]], with 9,787 inhabitants in 2010.&amp;lt;ref name=scb /&amp;gt;

==History==
Ulricehamn, originally known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bogesund&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has been populated at least since the Middle Ages. The town has had [[City status in Sweden|city privileges]] since at least the 15th century. There are still several old buildings from the 17th and 18th century and the picturesque main street &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Storgatan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has existed in its present form for centuries. Among other historical structures, there is the [[city hall]], located at the market square, a yellowish [[rococo]] building from 1789.

The town is situated on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ätranstigen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;The Ätran path&amp;quot;), a trail following the river [[Ätran (river)|Ätran]], stretching from the [[Kattegat]] strait in the west an inwards the country, connecting with other roads leading eventually to the eastern cities [[Sigtuna]] and [[Uppsala]]. In 1520, the [[Battle of Bogesund]] took place on the ice of the lake [[Åsunden (Västergötland)|Åsunden]].

In 1741, it was renamed Ulricehamn in honour of Queen [[Ulrike Eleonora of Sweden|Ulrica Eleonora]]. Following a fire in 1788 it encountered a recession, but several textile industries were established in the 19th century. Together with its first railroad in 1874 the town&amp;apos;s importance as a center of trade increased.

==Geography==
The town is located on the slopes of a lakeside, where the river [[Ätran (river)|Ätran]] flows into lake [[Åsunden (Västergötland)|Åsunden]]. The geography is signified by the scenic nature of trees and water, which offers popular activities such as bicycling, inlining and boat trips.

In the winter, Ulricehamn has become something of the Ski centre of Western Sweden. For [[alpine skiing]], there are 7 lifts and 6 slopes; while for [[cross-country skiing]] there are some 210 kilometers of prepared courses.
