        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ulf the Quarrelsome&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ulf Hreda&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is described in  [[Njals Saga]] as a brother (or sometimes identified as stepson) to [[Brian Boru]],  [[High King of Ireland]] from 1002 to 1014.  He is primarily mentioned in Njals saga&amp;apos;s account of the [[Battle of Clontarf]] of [[1014 in Ireland|1014]], in the aftermath of which he gruesomely killed [[Brodir and Ospak of Man|Brodir]] of the [[Isle of Man]] to avenge his brother&amp;apos;s death at the hands of the invaders:

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ulf the Quarrelsome cut open his belly, and led him round and round the trunk of a tree, and so wound all his entrails out of him, and he did not die before they were all drawn out of him.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Some have identified Ulf as a brother of Brian named Cuiduligh.
