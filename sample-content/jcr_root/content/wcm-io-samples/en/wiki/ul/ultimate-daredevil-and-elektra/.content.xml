&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ultimate Daredevil and Elektra&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a four-issue [[comic book]] [[limited series|mini-series]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] written by [[Greg Rucka]] with art by [[Salvador Larroca]]. Marvel characters [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] are introduced to the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] universe in the series in October 2001.

==Plot==
{{more plot|date=November 2012}}
In this story, Matt Murdock and Elektra Natchios are both students in [[Columbia University]], where they meet and start dating. Murdock is [[blindness|blind]] and studying [[law]]. During the course of the story, Elektra and her roommates are harassed by a rich boy, Trey Langstrom, until Elektra, a [[martial arts|martial artist]] fights back. In response, Langstrom and a group of thugs destroys Elektra&amp;apos;s father&amp;apos;s business. Murdock, also a martial artist and possessor of enhanced [[senses]] (which compensate for his blindness), forces the thugs to confess, but couldn&amp;apos;t stop Elektra from seriously wounding Langstrom. While Matt reveals his identity to Elektra, she forces him to choose between their love and his sense of duty. He chooses the second and they apparently part ways.

Reviewer Iain Duncan rated the series 6 out of 10 noting he was &amp;quot;let down by this series&amp;quot;. He is critical of the pacing considering it slow and &amp;quot;rather boring&amp;quot;. He comments that Larroca&amp;apos;s art is exceptional however poor inking and colouring makes it subpar.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | last = Duncan | first = Iain | url=http://www.southside.za.net/reviews/may03/ultmateddelktra1.htm | title=Ultimate Daredevil &amp;amp; Elektra | publisher=southside.za.net | accessdate=2008-07-21}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
