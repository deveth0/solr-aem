        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Regulation 17&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-fr|Règlement 17}}) was a regulation of the [[Ontario]] [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)|Ministry of Education]], issued in July 1912 by the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Conservative]] government of [[Premier of Ontario|premier]] Sir [[James P. Whitney]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;tce&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Barber, Marilyn. &amp;quot;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;amp;Params=A1ARTA0005945 Ontario Schools Question]&amp;quot;, in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Canadian Encyclopedia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, retrieved November 20, 2008&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It restricted the use of [[French language|French]] as a language of instruction to the first two years of schooling. It was amended in 1913, and it is that version that was applied throughout Ontario.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;tce&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;slmc&amp;quot;&amp;gt;SLMC. &amp;quot;[http://www.salic-slmc.ca/showpage.asp?file=legislations_ling/documents_hist/1912_reglement_17&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;updatemenu=false&amp;amp;noprevnext Regulation 17: Circular of Instruction No. 17 for Ontario Separate Schools for the School Year 1912–1913]&amp;quot;, in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Site for Language Management in Canada&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, retrieved November 20, 2008&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[French Canada]] reacted with outrage. [[Quebec]] journalist [[Henri Bourassa]] denounced the &amp;quot;Prussians of Ontario&amp;quot; (see [[French-German enmity#French.E2.80.93Prussian enmity|French-Prussian enmity]]). It was strongly opposed by [[Franco-Ontarian]]s, particularly in the national capital of [[Ottawa]] where the [[École Guigues]] was at the centre of the controversy. The newspaper &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Le Droit]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which is still published today as the province&amp;apos;s only francophone daily newspaper, was established by the [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate]] in 1913 to oppose the ban. Faced with separate school boards&amp;apos; resistance and defiance of the new regulation, the Ministry of Education issued Regulation 18 in August 1913 to coerce the school boards&amp;apos; employees into compliance.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Leclerc, Jacques. &amp;quot;[http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/amnord/ontario_reglement18.htm Circular of Instructions No. 18]&amp;quot;, in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;L&amp;apos;aménagement linguistique dans le monde&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, retrieved November 20, 2008&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1915, the provincial government of Sir [[William Howard Hearst|William Hearst]] replaced Ottawa&amp;apos;s elected [[separate school]] board with a government-appointed commission. After years of litigation from [[AFO (Canada)|ACFÉO]], however, the directive was never fully implemented.

The regulation was eventually repealed in 1927 by the government of [[Howard Ferguson]] following the recommendations of the Merchant-Scott-Côté report.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;slmc&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; Ferguson was an opponent of [[bilingualism]], but repealed the law because he needed to form a political alliance with Quebec premier [[Louis-Alexandre Taschereau]] against the [[Government of Canada|federal government]]. The Conservative government reluctantly recognized bilingual schools, but the directive worsened relations between Ontario and Quebec for many years and is still keenly remembered by the French-speaking minority of Ontario.

Despite the repeal of Regulation 17, however, French language schools in Ontario were not officially recognized under the provincial Education Act until 1968.

The [[Ontario Heritage Trust]] erected a plaque for L’École Guigues and Regulation 17 in front of the former school building, 159 Murray Street, Ottawa. &amp;quot;L’École Guigues became the centre of minority-rights agitation in Ontario when in 1912 the provincial government issued a directive, commonly called Regulation 17, restricting French-language education. Mounting protests forced the government to moderate its policy and in 1927 bilingual schools were officially recognized.&amp;quot;
