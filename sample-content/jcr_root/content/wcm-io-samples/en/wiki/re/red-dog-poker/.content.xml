        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Red dog&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;red dog poker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;yablon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a [[game of chance]] played with [[card game|cards]]. It is a variation of [[Acey Deucey (cards)|acey-deucey]] or [[Acey Deucey (cards)|in-between]]. While found in some land [[casino]]s, its popularity has declined, although it is featured at many [[Online casino|casinos online]]. Confusingly, there are other card-based games of chance by the same name that are unrelated to the rules described here.

The deck used to play red dog is the standard, fifty-two-card variety. The game may be played with anywhere from one to eight decks, with an increasing number of decks decreasing the house edge â€” the house&amp;apos;s advantage begins at 3.155% with one deck, but falls to 2.751% when eight decks are used. This is in contrast with some other casino card games, such as blackjack, where a higher number of decks used will increase the house edge.

The game only uses three cards at a time, which are ranked as in [[poker]], with aces high. Suit is irrelevant. A wager is placed, and two cards are placed face up on the table, with three possible outcomes:

*If the cards are &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;consecutive in number&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (for example, a four and a five, or a jack and a queen), the hand is a push and the player&amp;apos;s wager is returned.

*If the two cards are &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;of equal value&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a third card is dealt. If the third card is of the same value, then the payout for the player is 11:1, otherwise the hand is a push.

*If neither of the above is the case (for example, a three and an eight), then a spread is announced which determines the payoff (a 4-card spread, in this example), and a third card  will be dealt. Before dealing the third card, the player has the option to double his bet. If the third card&amp;apos;s value falls between the first two, the player will receive a payoff according to the spread; otherwise the bet is lost.

The spread table is as follows:

{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;
|-
!Spread
!Payout
|-
|1-card
|5 to 1
|-
|2-card
|4 to 1
|-
|3-card
|2 to 1
|-
|4-to-11-card
|1 to 1 (even money)
|}

==Strategies==
Even when using eight decks, red dog does not offer favorable odds for the player in comparison with other games of chance common to casinos. There is little strategy involved; raises should only be made when a spread statistically favors a player (which is at seven cards or more, regardless of the number of decks used).
