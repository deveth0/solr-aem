A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;reflecting pool&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;reflection pool&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a water feature found in gardens, parks, and at memorial sites.  It usually consists of a shallow pool of                                                                                           [[water]], undisturbed by fountain jets, for a calm, reflective surface.

==Design==
Reflecting pools are often designed with the outer basin floor at the rim slightly deeper than the central area to suppress wave formation. They can be as small as a bird bath, to as large as a major civic element. Their origins are from ancient [[Persian gardens]].
