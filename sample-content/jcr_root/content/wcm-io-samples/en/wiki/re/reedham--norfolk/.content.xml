&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reedham&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[England|English]] [[county]] of [[Norfolk]] and within [[The Broads]]. It is situated on the north bank of the [[River Yare]], some {{convert|20|km}} east of the city of [[Norwich]], {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} south-west of the town of [[Great Yarmouth]] and the same distance north-west of the [[Suffolk]] town of [[Lowestoft]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ordnance Survey (2005). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;OS Explorer Map OL40 - The Broads&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. ISBN 0-319-23769-9.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The Romans had a settlement there, and King [[Edmund of East Anglia]] is said to have lived here. The Fastolf family, whose most celebrated member was [[Sir John Fastolf]], are recorded here from the thirteenth century.

The civil parish includes a significant area of nearby marshland, together with the famously isolated settlement of [[Berney Arms]]. It has an area of {{convert|12.45|km2|abbr=on}} and in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]] had a population of 925 in 406 households. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the [[Non-metropolitan district|district]] of [[Broadland]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Office for National Statistics &amp;amp; Norfolk County Council (2001). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://www.norfolk.gov.uk/consumption/groups/public/documents/general_resources/ncc017867.xls Census population and household counts for unparished urban areas and all parishes]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Retrieved December 2, 2005.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Reedham Ferry]], a [[cable ferry|chain ferry]] just outside the village, is the only road crossing point on the River Yare between Norwich and Great Yarmouth. The [[Wherry Lines|railway line]] between Norwich and Lowestoft crosses the river on [[Reedham Swing Bridge]].
