In [[semantics]], a [[grammatical modifier|modifier]] is said to be &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;restrictive&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;defining&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) if it restricts the [[reference#Semantics|reference]] of its [[head (linguistics)|head]]. For example, in &amp;quot;the red car is fancier than the blue one&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;red&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;blue&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are restrictive, because they restrict which cars &amp;apos;&amp;apos;car&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;one&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are referring to. (&amp;quot;The car is fancier than the one&amp;quot; would make little sense.) By contrast, in &amp;quot;John&amp;apos;s beautiful mother&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;beautiful&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is [[non-restrictive]]; &amp;quot;John&amp;apos;s mother&amp;quot; identifies her sufficiently, while &amp;quot;beautiful&amp;quot; only serves to add more information.

Restrictive modifiers are also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;defining&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;identifying&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;essential&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;necessary&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; non-restrictive ones are also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;non-defining&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;non-identifying&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;descriptive&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;unnecessary&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (though this last term can be misleading). In certain cases, generally when restrictiveness is marked [[syntax|syntactically]] through the lack of commas,{{Clarify me|date=April 2009}} restrictive modifiers are called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;integrated&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and non-restrictive ones are called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;non-integrated&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;supplementary&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Restrictiveness in English==
{{main|English relative clauses}}
English does not generally mark modifiers for restrictiveness. The only modifiers that are consistently marked for restrictiveness are [[relative clause]]s: non-restrictive ones are set off in writing by using commas, and in speech through [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] (with a pause beforehand and an uninterrupted melody), while restrictive ones are not. Further, while restrictive clauses are often headed by the [[relative pronoun]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;that&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or by a [[zero (linguistics)|zero relative pronoun]], non-restrictive clauses are not. For example:

*Restrictive: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;We saw two puppies this morning: one that was born yesterday and one that was born last week. The one &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;that (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;or&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;which*) was born yesterday&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is tiny.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
*Non-restrictive: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;We saw a puppy and a kitty this morning. The puppy, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;which was born yesterday&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was tiny.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

(*In formal [[American English]], the use of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;which&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as a restrictive pronoun is often considered to be incorrect. See [[English relative clauses#That or which|That or which]].)

While English does not consistently mark ordinary [[adjective]]s for restrictiveness, they can be marked by moving them into relative clauses. For example, &amp;quot;the red car is fancier than the blue one&amp;quot; can be rewritten as &amp;quot;the car that&amp;apos;s red is fancier than the one that&amp;apos;s blue.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;John&amp;apos;s beautiful wife&amp;quot; can be rewritten as &amp;quot;John&amp;apos;s wife, who is beautiful,&amp;quot; to avoid the suggestion of disambiguation between John&amp;apos;s various wives. English speakers do not generally find such locutions necessary, however.
