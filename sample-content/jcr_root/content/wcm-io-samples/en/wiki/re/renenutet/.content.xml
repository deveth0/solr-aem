&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Renenutet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ernutet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Renenet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was a goddess of nourishment and the harvest in [[ancient Egyptian religion]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Pinch|first=Geraldine|title=Egyptian mythology: a guide to the gods, goddesses, and traditions of ancient Egypt|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195170245}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The importance of the harvest caused people to make many offerings to Renenutet during harvest time.
Initially, her cult was centered in [[Terenuthis]]. Renenutet was envisioned, particularly in art, as a [[cobra]], or as a woman with the head of a cobra.

Sometimes, as the goddess of nourishment, Renenutet was seen as having a husband, [[Sobek]]. He was represented as the Nile River, the annual flooding of which deposited the fertile silt that enabled abundant harvests. More usually, Renenutet was seen as the mother of [[Nehebkau]], who occasionally was represented as a snake also. When considered the mother of Nehebkau, Renenutet was seen as having a husband, [[Geb]], who represented the Earth.

Later, as a snake-goddess worshiped over the whole of [[Lower Egypt]], Renenutet was increasingly associated with [[Wadjet]], Lower Egypt&amp;apos;s powerful protector and another snake goddess represented as a cobra. Eventually Renenutet was identified as an alternate form of Wadjet, whose gaze was said to slaughter enemies. Wadjet is the cobra on the crown of the pharaohs.

==Hymn==
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hymn of Renenutet&amp;apos;&amp;apos; says:
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;I will make the Nile swell for you&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;without there being a year of lack and exhaustion in the whole land&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;so the plants will flourish, bending under their fruit&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The land of Egypt is beginning to stir again&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;the shores are shining wonderfully&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;and wealth and well-being dwell with them&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;as it had been before&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
