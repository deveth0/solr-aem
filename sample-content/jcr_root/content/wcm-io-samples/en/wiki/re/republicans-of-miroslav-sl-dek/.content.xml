The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Republicans of Miroslav Sládek&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-cs|Republikáni Miroslava Sládka}}, abbreviated to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Republikáni&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;RMS&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a tiny political party in the [[Czech Republic]]. They are strongly opposed to the [[European Union|EU]], [[NATO]] and immigration.
The party was founded by [[Miroslav Sládek]] as a successor of [[Coalition for Republic - Republican Party of Czechoslovakia]] (SPR-RSČ, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sdružení pro republiku - Republikánská strana Československa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). The SPR-RSČ peaked in [[Czech legislative election, 1996]] with 8% of votes but declined since then and in 2001 it was disbanded due to financial irregularities.

Sládek, the leader of the SPR-RSČ, immediately set up a new party; to distinguish it from the other &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;republican&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; parties his name was added.

The new party failed to attract significant number of votes (0.9% during [[Czech legislative election, 2002]] was the highest). During [[Czech legislative election, 2006]] RMS joined the [[National Party (Czech Republic)|National Party]] which obtained 0.1% of votes.
Number of active members is estimated to be dozens.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://zpravy.idnes.cz/domaci.asp?r=domaci&amp;amp;c=A060319_081941_domaci_jan IDNES.cz]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Ideology==
RMS tries to continue in politics of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;SPR-RSČ&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, whose main aims were following:
* To reduce immigration into the [[Czech Republic]].
* To disband [[Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic]] in order to save money.
* To keep education free of charge
* To cancel a [[Progressive tax|Progressive income tax]] and introduce features of [[Direct democracy]] (such as direct presidential elections)
* To support national pride in cultural life
* They strongly criticised the [[European Union|EU]] and [[NATO]] and wanted to recover national sovereignty by leaving these organizations.
* They are known for a very negative attitude towards ethnic minorities in the [[Czech Republic]] - especially [[Romani people|Roma]] population.
