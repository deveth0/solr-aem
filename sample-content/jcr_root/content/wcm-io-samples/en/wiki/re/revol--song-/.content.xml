&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Revol&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; is a song by the Welsh [[Rock Music|rock]] band [[Manic Street Preachers]]. It was released on 1 August 1994 as the second single from their third studio album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which was released later in the month.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holy_Bible_(album)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It reached number 22 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 13 August 1994.
==Music and lyrics==

The song&amp;apos;s lyrics were written by rhythm guitarist [[Richey Edwards]] and bass guitarist [[Nicky Wire]]. The verses list famous and controversial names in history, each being dismissed one-by-one in short and often insulting [[staccato]] lines (such as &amp;apos;[[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]], you see God in you&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;[[Pol Pot]], withdrawn traces, bye-bye&amp;apos; ... &amp;apos;[[Che Guevara]], you&amp;apos;re all target now&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;[[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]], celibate self-importance&amp;apos;).

The track may be considered an autobiographical account of Edwards&amp;apos; attempts to hold down any meaningful relationships. &amp;quot;Revol&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;lover&amp;quot; spelt backwards. The lyric also places the names of famous political figures next to images of failure in sexual and emotional relationships. Wire, however, has said not even he knows exactly what the song is about.

[[James Dean Bradfield]] has previously been critical of the song, saying that he hates the UK version. He is, however, a fan of the US Mix by [[Tom Lord-Alge]], which can be found on the 10th Anniversary re-issue edition of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Holy Bible&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
