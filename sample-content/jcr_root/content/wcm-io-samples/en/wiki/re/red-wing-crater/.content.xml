&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;{{rp|335}}  The age of the structure is estimated at 200 ± 25 million years ([[Triassic]]).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;EID&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==History==

The Red Wing Creek structure shows up well in seismic studies.  The underlying [[Ordovician]] rocks are overlain by disturbed [[Devonian]] and [[Mississippian]] rocks.  The structural disturbance is filled by thick rocks of [[Jurassic]] age, suggesting that the impact took place during the [[Triassic]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;K1996&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;{{rp|336}}

[[Shell Oil Company]] drilled exploratory wells on the Red Wing Creek structure in 1965 and 1968.  These wells did not find oil, but did indicate very thick sections of [[Mississippian]] and [[Pennsylvanian]] rocks.  In 1972, True Oil Company drilled a well that discovered oil.  This discovery had an oil column that was about {{convert|870|m|abbr=on}} thick instead of the normal {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}}.  This thick oil column was because the rocks were tilted on their sides.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;K1996&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;{{rp|336}}

The discovery of oil led to intense geological and geophysical studies of the Red Wing Creek area.  In 1996, Christian Koeberl and his colleagues discovered [[planar deformation features]] (PDFs) in samples from two oil wells at the center of the structure.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;K1996&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;{{rp|335}}.  This provided unambiguous evidence for shock metamorphism, and confirmed the impact origin of the Red Wing Creek structure.

==Hypothetical multiple impact event==
{{main|Manicouagan crater#Hypothetical multiple impact event}}

It has been suggested by [[Geophysicist]] David Rowley of the [[University of Chicago]], working with John Spray of the [[University of New Brunswick]] and Simon Kelley of the [[Open University]], that the Red Wing crater may have been part of a hypothetical multiple impact event which also formed the [[Manicouagan crater]] in northern [[Quebec]], [[Rochechouart crater]] in France, [[Saint Martin crater]] in [[Manitoba]], and [[Obolon&amp;apos; crater]] in [[Ukraine]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Spray-1998&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Spray, J.G., Kelley, S.P. and Rowley, D.B. (1998). &amp;quot;Evidence for a late Triassic multiple impact event on Earth&amp;quot;. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, v. 392, pp. 171-173. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v392/n6672/abs/392171a0.html Abstract]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; All of the craters had previously been known and studied, but their paleoalignment had never before been demonstrated. Rowley has said that the chance that these craters could be aligned like this due to chance are nearly zero.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite news | last = Steele | first = Diana | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Crater chain points to impact of fragmented comet | newspaper = University of Chicago Chronicle | pages = | year = | date = 19 March 1998 | url = http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/980319/craters.shtml}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
