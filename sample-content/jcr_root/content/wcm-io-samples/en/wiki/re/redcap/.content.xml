A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Red Cap&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Redcap,&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also known as a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;powrie&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;dunter&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a type of malevolent murderous [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]], [[goblin]], [[elf]] or [[fairy]] found in [[English_Folklore#Folklore_of_Yorkshire_and_the_North_East|Border Folklore]]. They are said to inhabit ruined castles found along the border between [[England]] and [[Scotland]]. Redcaps are said to murder travellers who stray into their homes and dye their hats with their victims&amp;apos; blood (from which they get their name).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;K. M. Briggs, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p 57 University of Chicago Press, London, 1967&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Redcaps must kill regularly, for if the blood staining their hats dries out, they die.  Redcaps are very fast in spite of the heavy iron pikes they wield and the iron-shod boots they wear. Outrunning a redcap is supposedly impossible.

They are depicted as sturdy old men with red eyes, taloned hands and large teeth, wearing a red cap and bearing a [[pikestaff]] in the left hand.&amp;lt;ref name=BriggsFairies&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=Katherine M. |title=A Dictionary of Fairies|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex|date=1976|pages=339|isbn=0-14-004753-0}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The tale of one in [[Perthshire]] has him as more benign; living in a room in Grantully Castle, he bestows good fortune on those who see or hear him.&amp;lt;ref name=BriggsFairies/&amp;gt;

The [[Kabouter]], or redcaps of [[Dutch folklore]], are very different, and more akin to [[Brownie (folklore)|brownies]].&amp;lt;ref name=BriggsFairies/&amp;gt;

As the familiar of Lord [[William de Soulis]], a certain Robin Redcap wrought much harm and ruin in the lands of his master&amp;apos;s dwelling, [[Hermitage Castle]]. Ultimately, he was taken to the Nine Stane Rigg, a circle of stones hard by the castle, wrapped in lead, and boiled to death.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Mack146&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Mack, James Logan (1926). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Border Line&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Oliver &amp;amp; Boyd. Edinburgh.P. 146.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In reality William De Soulis was imprisoned in Dumbarton castle and died there, following his confessed complicity in the conspiracy against [[Robert the Bruce]] in 1320.
