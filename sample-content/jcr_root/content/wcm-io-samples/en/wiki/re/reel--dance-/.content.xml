The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;reel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[folk dance]] type as well as the accompanying [[dance music|dance tune type]]. In [[Scottish country dancing]], the reel is one of the four traditional dances, the others being the [[jig]], the [[strathspey (dance)|strathspey]] and the [[waltz]], and is also the name of a dance figure (see below).

In [[Irish dance]], a reel is any dance danced to music in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;reel time&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (see below). In [[Irish stepdance]], the reel is danced in soft shoes and is one of the first dances taught to students. There is also a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;treble reel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, danced in hard shoes to reel music.

==Reel music==

Reel music is notated in simple meter, either as 2/2 or 4/4. For example the same reel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rakish Paddy&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is notated in 2/2 time with an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;alla breve&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;cut time&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) [[Image:mensural proportion1.gif]] [[time signature]] in Miles Krassen, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;O&amp;apos;Neill&amp;apos;s Music of Ireland, New &amp;amp; Revisited&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p. 158, (1976), whereas in 4/4 time in Robin Williamson, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;English, Welsh, Scottish &amp;amp; Irish Fiddle Tunes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p. 69, (1976), each measure in both cases spanning the same part of the melody.

All reels have the same structure, consisting largely of [[quaver]] (eighth note) movement with an accent on the first and third beats of the bar. A reel is distinguished from a [[hornpipe]] by consisting primarily of even beats. Reels usually have two parts (A and B); in most reels each part is repeated (AABB), but in others it is not (ABAB). Each part (A and B) typically has eight bars, which in turn are divisible into four-bar and two-bar phrases. (An exception is the &amp;quot;auld reel&amp;quot; of [[Shetland]] which tends to irregular structure and may have been influenced by the Norwegian [[Halling (dance)|halling]].) The example of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCptMS8IZvA Johh Shand] performing [[Mairi&amp;apos;s Wedding]] follows the pattern ABABB, giving a pattern of 40 bars. The group of thirty-two bars (four times eight) is itself repeated three or four times before a second reel is introduced.  The grouping of two or more [[tune (folk music)|tunes]] in [[medley (music)|medleys]] or &amp;quot;[[set (folk music)|sets]]&amp;quot; is typical in [[Celtic music|Celtic]] [[dance music]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Today many Irish reels are supplemented with new compositions and by tunes from other traditions which are easily adapted as reels. It is the most popular [[tune (folk music)|tune]]-type within [[Irish traditional music|the Irish dance music tradition]].

Reels are popular in the [[folk music]] of South West [[England]]. It crossed the [[Atlantic]] ocean with Irish and British immigration and thus entered the musical tradition of Atlantic and French-speaking [[Canada]] including that of [[Music of Quebec|Quebecers]] and [[Acadians]].  Reels are featured in many pieces of [[Quebec]] singers and bands; for example: [[La Bolduc]], [[La Bottine Souriante]] and even the more modern &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[nÃ©o-trad]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; group [[Les Cowboys Fringants]] (like the song &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Les Cowboys Fringants#Mon Pays|Mon Pays suivi du Reel des aristocrates]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).
