In the [[United Kingdom]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reform Act&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a generic term used for legislation concerning electoral matters. It is most commonly used for laws passed to enfranchise new groups of voters and to redistribute seats in the [[British House of Commons]]. The periodic redrawing of constituency boundaries is now dealt with by a permanent [[Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Commission]] in each part of the United Kingdom, rather than by a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reform Act&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Some people in Britain, mostly associated with the [[Liberal Democrats]], have called for a new &amp;quot;Great Reform Act&amp;quot; to introduce electoral changes they favour. These would include lowering the minimum voting age to 16 and introducing [[proportional representation]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reform Act&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; may refer to:
*  [[Reform Act 1832]] (England and Wales), which gave representation to previously underrepresented urban areas and extended the qualifications for voting
* [[Scottish Reform Act 1832]], a similar reform applying to Scotland
* [[Irish Reform Act 1832]], a similar reform applying to Ireland
* [[Reform Act 1867]], which widened the franchise and adjusted representation to be more equitable
* [[Ballot Act 1872]] (sometimes called the &amp;quot;Reform Act of 1872&amp;quot;), which introduced the secret ballot

*  [[Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883]] (sometimes called the &amp;quot;Reform Act of 1883&amp;quot;), which introduced campaign spending limits
*[[Reform Act 1884]], which allowed people in counties to vote on the same basis as those in towns.  Home ownership was the only qualification
*  [[Reform Act 1885]], which split most multi-member constituencies into multiple single-member ones
*  [[Representation of the People Act 1918|Reform Act 1918]], which abolished property qualifications for men and introduced limited female suffrage
*  [[Reform Act 1928]], which widened suffrage by giving women electoral equality with men
