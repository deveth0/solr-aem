{{Programming evaluation}}
In [[computer science]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;remote evaluation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a general term for any technology that involves the transmission of executable software code from a [[client computer]] to a [[server computer]] for subsequent execution at the server. After the code has finished executing, the results of its execution are sent back to the client.

Remote evaluation belongs to the family of [[mobile code]], within the field of [[code mobility]]. An example for remote evaluation is [[grid computing]]: An executable task may be sent to a specific computer in the grid. After the execution has terminated, the result is sent back to the client. The client in turn may have to reassemble the different results of multiple concurrently calculated subtasks into one single result.
