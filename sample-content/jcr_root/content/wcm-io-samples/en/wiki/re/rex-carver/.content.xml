&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rex Carver&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a fictional [[United Kingdom|British]] [[private detective|private eye]] created by the prolific writer [[Victor Canning]]. He appeared in 5 fast-paced, irreverently narrated novels in the 1960s. Although strictly a private eye, Carver knows a number of people who work for a shadowy British undercover agency and he frequently runs into both enemy agents and hostile British agents during his adventures. It is by no means a stretch to call his adventures spy thrillers or to consider Carver himself a [[secret agent]] of sorts.
