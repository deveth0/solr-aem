        text="&lt;p&gt;[[Image:SCR-270-set-up.jpg|thumb|Reflective array &amp;apos;billboard&amp;apos; antenna of the AN-270 radar, an early radar system used in 1941 at Pearl Harbor.  It consists of 32 horizontal [[half wave dipole]]s mounted in front of a 55 ft. high screen reflector.  With an operating frequency of 106 MHz and a wavelength of 3 meters this large antenna was required to generate a sufficiently narrow beamwidth to locate enemy aircraft.]]

In [[telecommunication]] and [[radar]], a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;reflective array antenna&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a class of [[directional antenna|directive]] [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]]s  in which multiple [[driven element]]s are mounted in front of a flat surface designed to reflect the [[radio waves]] in a desired direction.  They are often used in the [[Very high frequency|VHF]] frequency band, and these versions often resemble a highway [[billboard]], so they are sometimes called &amp;quot;billboard antennas&amp;quot;.  The [[curtain array]] is a larger version used by [[shortwave]] radio stations.

Reflective array antennas usually have a number of identical driven elements, fed in phase, in front of a flat, electrically large [[reflector (antenna)|reflecting surface]] to produce a [[directional antenna|unidirectional]] [[Light beam|beam]],  increasing [[antenna gain]] and  reducing  [[radiation]] in unwanted directions.   The individual elements are most commonly [[half wave dipole]]s, although they sometimes contain [[parasitic element]]s as well as driven elements.  The reflector may be a metal sheet or more commonly a wire screen.   A metal screen reflects radio waves as well as a solid metal sheet as long as the holes in the screen are smaller than about one-tenth of a wavelength, so screens are often used to reduce weight and wind loads on the antenna.  They usually consist of a grill of parallel wires or rods, oriented parallel to the axis of the dipole elements.

Since the 1980s, versions for use at [[microwave]] frequencies have been made with [[patch antenna]] elements mounted in front of a metal surface.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Huang|first=john|title=Reflectarray antennas}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

This example has two dipole driven elements in front of a grill reflector oriented for [[vertical polarization]].  The &amp;quot;bow-tie&amp;quot; dipoles, consisting of two V-shaped elements, have a larger bandwidth, allowing the antenna to cover the wide UHF television band.
