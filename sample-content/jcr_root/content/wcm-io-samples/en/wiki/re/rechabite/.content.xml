        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rechabites&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|i:|k|ə|b|aɪ|t|s}} are the descendants of [[Rechab]] through [[Jonadab]] or [[Jehonadab]]. They belonged to the [[Kenites]] who accompanied the [[children of Israel]] into the [[holy land]], and dwelt among them. [[Moses]] married a Kenite wife,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Judges 1:16&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and [[Jael]] was the wife of &amp;quot;Heber the Kenite&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Judges 4:17&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Saul the King|Saul]] also showed kindness to the Kenites.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;1 Sam. 15:6&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The main body of the Kenites dwelt in cities, and adopted settled habits of life;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;1 Sam. 30:29&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; but Jehonadab forbade his descendants to drink wine or to live in cities.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Rechab and the Rechabites}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; They were commanded to lead always a nomad life. They adhered to the law laid down by Jonadab, and were noted for their fidelity to the old-established custom of their family in the days of [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]] (35); and this feature of their character is referred to by God for the purpose of giving point to his message to Judah.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Jer 35.14&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;They are referred to in Neh. 3:14 and 1 Chr. 2:55&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1839 the Reverend [[Joseph Wolff]], who later went to [[Bokhara]] to attempt to save Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Stoddart]] and Captain [[Arthur Conolly]], found in [[Yemen]], near [[Sana&amp;apos;a]], a tribe claiming to be descendants of Jehonadab; and in the late nineteenth century a [[Bedouin]] tribe was found near the [[Dead Sea]] who also professed to be descendants of Jehonadab.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/easton/ebd2.html?term=Rechabites Rechabites] - [[Easton&amp;apos;s Bible Dictionary]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rechabites&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also refers to a religious order, similar in some ways to the [[Nazarites]], and are mentioned by [[Eusebius of Emesa]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;H. E. ii. 23&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In more recent times, the name has been used by [[Christian]] groups keen to promote [[Christianity and alcohol|total abstinence from alcohol]], such as the [[Independent Order of Rechabites]]. Many Muslims still claim descent from Rechab, among the nearly-universal claim of [[Arabs]] to descend from [[Abraham]] through [[Ishmael]] (Ismail).
