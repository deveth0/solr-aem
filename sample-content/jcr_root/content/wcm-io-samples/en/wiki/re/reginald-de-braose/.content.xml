&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reginald de Braose&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (died June 1228) was one of the sons of [[William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber]] and Matilda, also known as [[Maud de Braose|Maud de St. Valery]] and Lady de la Haie. Her other children included William and Giles.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography under &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Briouze  [Braose], William (III) de&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The de Braoses were loyal to King [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] but grew in power under [[King]] [[John of England]]. The dynasty was in conflict with King John towards the end of his reign and almost lost everything.

Reginald de Braose was a scion of the powerful [[Welsh Marches|Marcher]] family of de Braose, helped manage its survival and was also related by marriage to the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[Princes of Wales]].

== Magna Carta ==

He supported his brother [[Giles de Braose]] in his rebellions against King John. Both brothers were active against the King in the Baron&amp;apos;s War. Neither was present at the signing of [[Magna Carta]] in June 1215 because at this time they were still rebels who refused to compromise.

== Restoration of royal favour ==

King John acquiesced to Reginald&amp;apos;s claims to the de Braose estates in Wales in May 1216. Reginald became Lord of [[Brecon]], [[Abergavenny]], [[Builth]] and held other Marcher Lordships but was also very much a vassal of the Welsh leader [[Llywelyn the Great|Llewelyn Fawr]], Prince of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] who became his father-in-law in 1215 &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Brut y Tywysogion&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; when Reginald married Llywelyn&amp;apos;s daughter, [[Gwladus Ddu]].

[[Henry III of England|Henry III]] restored Reginald to favour and the Bramber estates (confiscated by King John) in 1217.

== Welsh wars ==

At this seeming betrayal, Rhys and Owain, Reginald&amp;apos;s Welsh nephews who were Princes of [[Deheubarth]], were incensed and took [[Builth]], except the castle. [[Llywelyn Fawr]] also became angry and his forces besieged [[Brecon]]. Reginald eventually surrendered to Llewelyn and gave up Seinhenydd ([[Swansea]]).

By 1221 they were at war again, with Llewelyn again laying siege to [[Builth]]. The siege was relieved by King Henry III&amp;apos;s forces. From this time on Llewelyn tended to support the claims of Reginald&amp;apos;s nephew [[John de Braose]] concerning the de Braose lands in Wales.

Reginald was a witness to the re-issue of [[Magna Carta]] by King Henry III in 1225.

He died two or three years later in 1227 or 1228 in [[Brecon]] and was succeeded by his son by his first wife, Grecia Briwere, the ill-fated [[William de Braose (died 1230)|William de Braose, Lord Abergavenny]]. He is buried at [[Brecon Cathedral]].

It may be that the [[Matilda de Braose (Deheubarth)|Matilda de Braose]] who was the wife of [[Rhys Mechyll]], [[Prince of Deheubarth]] was the daughter of Reginald.
