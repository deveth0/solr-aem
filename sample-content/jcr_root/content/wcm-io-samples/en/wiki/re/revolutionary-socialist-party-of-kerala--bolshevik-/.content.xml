        text="&lt;p&gt;[[Image:Rspb.JPG|thumb|2006 Kerala state legislative election poster of RSP(B), calling for a vote for LDF candidates]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Revolutionary Socialist Party of Kerala (Bolshevik)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [&amp;apos;&amp;apos;RSP(B)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;] was formed as a splinter-group from [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)|Revolutionary Socialist Party]] in [[Kerala]] in 2001. The party leader at the time of its formation was [[Baby John]], formerly an important RSP leader in Kerala.

RSP(B) joined the [[United Democratic Front (India)|United Democratic Front]], the alliance in Kerala which is led by the [[Indian National Congress]]. The party won two seats in the Kerala Legislative Assembly, Shibu Baby John (Baby John&amp;apos;s son) and Babu Divakaran, in the 2001 state election. In total the party had put up four candidates in the state elections that year. Together the four candidates got 215 562 votes (1,37% of the votes in the state). After the 2001 elections, the RSP(B) became part of the state government. Babu Divakaran became the Minister of Labour in the state government.

In 2005 RSP(B) left UDF, a decision largely attributed to the party general secretary AV Thamaraksan. Babu Divakaran split away and formed the [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (Marxist)]].

In other constituencies the party supported the [[Left Democratic Front (Kerala)|Left Democratic Front]].

Currently RSP(B) is led by party general secretary AV Thamaraksan.
