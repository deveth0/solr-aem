&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reform&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; means the improvement or amendment of what is wrong, corrupt, unsatisfactory, etc.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;dictionary definition http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reform?s=t&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The use of the word in this way emerges in the late 1700’s and is believed to originate from Christopher Wyvill’s Association movement which identified “Parliamentary Reform” as its primary aim. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Reform in English Public Life: the fortunes of a word. Joanna Innes 2003&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Reform is generally distinguished from [[revolution]]. The latter means basic or radical change; whereas reform may be no more than fine tuning, or at most redressing serious wrongs without altering the fundamentals of the system.  Reform seeks to improve the system as it stands, never to overthrow it wholesale. Radicals on the other hand, seek to improve the system, but try to overthrow whether it be the government or a group of people themselves.

[[Rotation in office]] or [[term limits]] would, by contrast, be more revolutionary, in altering basic political connections between incumbents and constituents.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;On term limits reform see, [http://www.ustl.org/index.html U.S. Term Limits].  On more radical/revolutionary changes, including term limits, see, for example, Robert Struble, Jr., [http://www.tell-usa.org  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Treatise on Twelve Lights: To Restore America the Beautiful under God and the Written Constitution&amp;apos;&amp;apos;], 2007-08 edition.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Developing countries]] may carry out a wide range of reforms to improve their living standards, often with support from [[international financial institutions]] and [[aid agencies]]. This can include reforms to [[macroeconomic policy]], the [[civil service reform in developing countries|civil service]], and [[Public finance|public financial management]].

==Re-form==
A note about [[spelling]]: when used to describe something which is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;physically&amp;apos;&amp;apos; formed again, such as re-[[casting]] it in a [[molding (process)|mold/mould]], or a [[band (music)|band]] that gets back together, the proper term is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;re-form&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (with a [[hyphen]]), not &amp;quot;reform&amp;quot;.
