        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Redbone&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a term historically used in much of the [[southern United States]], particularly in [[Louisiana]], to refer to a [[Métis|Métis or Mestee]] ethnic group of mixed racial heritage.

==Definition==
The term had various meanings according to locality, most implying [[multiracial]] people.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;everett&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Everett, C.S. &amp;quot;Brass Ankles/Red Bones,&amp;quot; Vol. Ed. Celeste Ray, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;6 Encyclopedia of Southern Culture&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (University of North Carolina Press 2007), pp. 102-104&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  In Louisiana, the Redbones were migrants to the state from [[South Carolina]] following the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;everett&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; They settled primarily in the western areas and were distinguished by surnames of English origin (in contrast to the French and Spanish names of the [[Louisiana Creole people]]), as well as by following Protestant rather than Catholic religion, which predominated in much of Louisiana.

== Redbones==
The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Redbone&amp;apos;&amp;apos; became disfavored in the late 1960s, as it was a pejorative nickname applied by others to the geographically and socially isolated multi-racial populations in most western Louisiana parishes, from [[Sabine Parish]] in the northwest and [[Rapides Parish]] near the center of the state down to [[Calcasieu Parish]] in the southwest.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;everett&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  This area is roughly coextensive with what was once known as the [[Neutral Ground (Louisiana)|Neutral Ground]] or [[Sabine Free State]], when no US state exercised jurisdiction over the area from the [[Calcasieu River]] on the east to the [[Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)|Sabine River]] on the west.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;See&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Adams-Onís Treaty]].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Families ancestral to the Louisiana Redbones came primarily from [[South Carolina]] (where they were generally classified in census records as &amp;quot;[[free people of color|other free persons]]&amp;quot;, in other words, non-white.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;everett&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; They settled in the hills and prairies of western Louisiana following the [[Louisiana Purchase]] by the United States in 1803.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;everett&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; In this frontier area, the settlers successfully resisted classification as non-white. In addition, Louisiana in New Orleans and associated areas, had a strong tradition of a free class of multi-racial people who developed during the colonial period.

But, enough discrimination existed so Redbones typically established their own communities with churches, stores, and schools.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;everett&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Public schools were first established following the [[American Civil War]] by the [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]] legislature; they were segregated  until the United States Supreme Court ruling in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Brown v. Board of Education]] (1954)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Though their descendants now number over 20,000 and are dispersed to other states, especially eastern [[Texas]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;See&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Regulator-Moderator War]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; academically the group has been termed &amp;quot;largely unstudied.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;everett&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
