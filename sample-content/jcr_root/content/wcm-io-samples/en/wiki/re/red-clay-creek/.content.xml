        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Red Clay Creek&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a {{convert|13.6|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[tributary]] of [[White Clay Creek]], running through southeastern [[Pennsylvania]] and northern [[Delaware]] in the [[United States]].&amp;lt;ref name=NHD/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=courseconflict/&amp;gt;  As of 2000, portions of the creek are under wildlife habitat protection.

==Course==
The East and West branches both rise in [[West Marlborough Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania]], near the hamlet of Upland, and flow south through [[Kennett Square, Pennsylvania|Kennett Square]] before uniting just north of the Delaware border. The stream enters Delaware near the town of [[Yorklyn, Delaware|Yorklyn]] and flows southward through [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]], passing through [[Marshallton, Delaware|Marshallton]].  [[White Clay Creek]] empties into Red Clay Creek near [[Stanton, Delaware|Stanton]],&amp;lt;ref name=boyd1874/&amp;gt; approximately {{convert|5|mi}} southwest of [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]].  Ultimately, Red Clay Creek enters the Christiana River, also near Stanton.&amp;lt;ref name=boyd1874/&amp;gt;

==Tributaries==
* Calf Run, located in the southeast of [[Mill Creek Hundred]]&amp;lt;ref name=boyd1874/&amp;gt;
* Pyle&amp;apos;s Run, located in [[Christiana Hundred]]&amp;lt;ref name=boyd1874/&amp;gt;

==History==
The creek serves as a boundary between the [[Hundred (county subdivision)|Hundreds]] of [[Mill Creek Hundred|Mill Creek]] and [[Christiana Hundred|Christiana]].&amp;lt;ref name=boyd1874/&amp;gt;  The [[Wilmington and Western Railroad]] follows the creek south from [[Yorklyn, Delaware|Yorklyn]] as far as [[Greenbank, Delaware|Greenbank]].

In the late 19&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;th&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; Century, several factories were located along Red Clay Creek, including those for the manufacture of [[Gristmill|flour]], [[wool]] and [[Ironworks|iron]].&amp;lt;ref name=boyd1874/&amp;gt;

The creek suffered from severe flooding in 1999 due to [[Hurricane Floyd]] and in 2003 due to [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Henri|Tropical Storm Henri]].

Since 2000, portions of the river, along with other tributaries of White Clay Creek, have been protected as part of the [[White Clay Creek Wild and Scenic River]].

==Bridges==
* [[Ashland Covered Bridge]], in New Castle County, Delaware&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nris&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
* [[Wooddale Bridge]], in New Castle County, Delaware&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nris&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

The text of the article reflects the U.S. Geological Survey information; Boyd indicates that White Clay Creek is a tributary of Red Clay Creek and that it is Red Clay Creek which flows into the Christina (Christiana) River.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
