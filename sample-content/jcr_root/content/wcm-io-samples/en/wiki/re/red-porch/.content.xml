[[File:Bow to the People.JPG|thumb|250px|Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] bows to his people from the Kremlin&amp;apos;s Red Porch.]]

The splendid &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Red Porch&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Red Staircase&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Lang-ru|Красное крыльцо}}, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Krasnoe Kryltso&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), decorated with stone lions, leads into the [[Palace of Facets]] in the Kremlin, [[Moscow]].

In old Russian the word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;krasny&amp;apos;&amp;apos; meant &amp;quot;beautiful&amp;quot;, but today it means &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;.  This is the same word used for &amp;quot;[[Red Square]]&amp;quot;.

On the morning of his [[Coronation of the Russian monarch|coronation]], the [[Tsar]] was met at the Red Porch, where he took his place beneath a large [[Baldachin|canopy]] held by thirty-two Russian generals, with other officers providing additional support. Accompanied by his [[queen consort|consort]] (under a separate canopy) and the [[Russian Imperial Crown|imperial regalia]], he proceeded slowly toward the Cathedral of the Dormition, where his [[coronation|crowning]] and [[anointing]] would take place. After the service, the Emperor and Empress proceeded under canopies back to the Red Porch of the Kremlin, where they rested and prepared for a great ceremonial meal at the Kremlin&amp;apos;s Hall of Facets. During their procession back to their Kremlin palace, later rulers (starting with [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]) stopped on the Red Staircase and bowed three times to the assembled people in the courtyard, symbolizing what one historian has called &amp;quot;an unspoken bond of devotion&amp;quot; between ruler and subjects.&amp;quot;

In the 1930s the porch was destroyed, and its place was taken by an unimpressive Kremlin canteen. In 1994 the Red Porch was the first of [[Moscow]]’s monuments to be restored.
