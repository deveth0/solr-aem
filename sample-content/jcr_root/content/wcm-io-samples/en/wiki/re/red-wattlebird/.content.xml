The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Red Wattlebird&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anthochaera carunculata&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Barkingbird&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gillbird&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a [[honeyeater]]; a group of birds found mainly in [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]] which have highly developed brush-tipped tongues adapted for [[nectar]] feeding. The tongue is flicked rapidly and repeatedly into a flower, the upper mandible then compressing any liquid out when the bill is closed.

Although honeyeaters look and behave very much like other nectar-feeding [[passerine]]s around the world (such as the [[sunbird]]s and [[flowerpecker]]s), they are unrelated, and the similarities are the consequence of [[convergent evolution]]. The Red Wattlebird is a large (up to 35&amp;amp;nbsp;cm) grey-brown honeyeater with red eyes, distinctive red [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattles]] either side of the neck and white streaks on the chest and belly, which reveals a bright yellow patch towards the tail. Juveniles are generally less flamboyant, with less prominent wattles and browner eyes.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://ozwildlife.awardspace.com/wildlifedetail.php?genus=Anthochaera&amp;amp;species=carunculata Entry at Oz Wildlife&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The species is found in SE [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] and southwest [[Western Australia]] in open forest, woodland, and near human habitation. The nest is formed from sticks and leaves lined with bark and hair, between 2 and 16 meters above ground, usually in the forked branches of a tree or shrub, in which two or three, pale brown-spotted pink [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s are normally laid.

In addition to nectar, it takes insects and other small creatures, usually by [[hawking (birds)|hawking]], and also [[berry|berries]] and other fruit.

This bird was first described by [[John White (surgeon)|John White]] in his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1790).&amp;lt;ref name=IUCN2012/&amp;gt;
