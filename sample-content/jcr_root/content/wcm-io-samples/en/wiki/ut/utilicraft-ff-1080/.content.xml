The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;FF-1080&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[aircraft]] design by [[Utilicraft Aerospace Industries]] of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] for a twin [[tubroprop]] aircraft fitted to carry [[Unit Load Device|LD3]] aircraft cargo containers between large airports and smaller airports.

Twin Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney PW-150C [[turbine]]s turn propellers with eight blades, to power the [[STOL]] aircraft for takeoff runs as short of less than 3,000 feet (1&amp;amp;nbsp;km). The aircraft is designed to carry as much as {{convert|20000|lb|abbr=on}} for a {{convert|3200|nmi|km|sing=on}} range carrying beneath its {{convert|1315|sqft|m2}} of high-mounted wings.

American Utilicraft, the predecessor of Utilicraft Aerospace Industries, patented the design for the FF-1080 in 1991. Prototype engineering began in 2000 at Aircraft Design Services Incorporated in San Antonio, Texas. A company called Micro Craft was chosen to build the prototype, with plans to build subassemblies at a factory in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], [[Alabama]]  and to assemble the prototype at [[Gwinnett Airport]] in [[Atlanta]].

On February 13, American Utilicraft entered a memorandum of understanding with the [[Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico|San Juan Pueblo]] (now known as the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo) to build a production aircraft assembly plant in northern [[New Mexico]]. The Ohkay Owingeh Indian pueblo is the owner of [[Ohkay Owingeh Airport]]. State officials encouraged the companies and the pueblo to seek state loans to begin production of the aircraft.
