        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Odisha Communist Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[political party]] in the [[India]]n state of [[Odisha]]. OCP was formed in the beginning of the 1990s as a splinter-group of [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]]. The party is led by Ajeya Rout.[http://www.broadleft.org/in.htm] When the split occurred the dissidents tried to capture the trade union structure of CPI(M) in the mining areas in northern Odisha. This led to violent conflict. But the OCP-ers themselves came from southern Odisha, and they were not able to convince the northern grassroots to follow them. In the end the OCP-ers had to leave the mining areas. Today OCP is more or less defunct. It has good relations with the [[Indian National Congress]], who gave OCP an office in the state capital [[Bhubaneshwar]].

Radhakanta Sethi, who was elected to the Odisha legislative assembly as a CPI(M)-candidate, joined OCP in 1992 after a period as an independent.[http://164.100.140.22/ola/brief3.htm]

OCP participates in the [[Confederation of Indian Communists and Democratic Socialists]].[http://www.hindu.com/2005/02/09/stories/2005020906330400.htm]
