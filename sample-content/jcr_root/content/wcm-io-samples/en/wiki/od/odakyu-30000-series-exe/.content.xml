The {{Nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Odakyu 30000 series EXE&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|小田急30000形|Odakyū 30000-gata}} (Excellent Express) is an [[electric multiple unit]] operated by  the [[Odakyu Electric Railway]], in Japan.

==Design==
The 30000 series EXE has a mostly boxy shape. The nose of the front car is usually slanted, however it could also be flat. On the slant-nosed power car, the headlights are above the cab&amp;apos;s front windshield. Below the front window is an [[LED]] display showing the train service name. Below that there is a broad red stripe going vertically down the front, with small black &amp;quot;EXE&amp;quot; letters in the middle of it.

On the sides of the cars, there is another vertical red stripe going down the middle of the cars.

==Operations==
The 30000 EXE operates mainly between [[Shinjuku Station]] (Tokyo) and [[Hakone-Yumoto Station]] (about 88&amp;amp;nbsp;km), and also on [[Odakyū Enoshima Line]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Enoshima (train)|Enoshima]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; services from Shinjuku to [[Katase-Enoshima Station]].
