{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oda Nobuhide&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|織田 信秀|extra=1510 &amp;amp;ndash; April 8, 1551}} was a warlord and magistrate of lower [[Owari Province]] during the [[Sengoku period]] of [[Japan]]. His father was [[Oda Nobusada]] and Nobuhide was the father of [[Oda Nobunaga]].

==Ruling the clan==
As the head of the [[Oda clan]], Nobuhide was involved in open warfare as he was fronted to the north by [[Saitō Dōsan]], [[daimyo]] of [[Mino Province]], and to the east by [[Imagawa Yoshimoto]], the daimyo of [[Mikawa Province|Mikawa]], [[Suruga Province|Suruga]], and [[Tōtōmi Province|Tōtōmi]] provinces. However, he was never able to fully unite [[Owari Province]]. Though he managed to hold his own against any of the opponents, constant internal struggles within Oda clan prevented him from achieving a complete victory.  In 1549, Nobuhide made peace with Saitō Dōsan by arranging a political marriage between his eldest son, Nobunaga, and Saitō&amp;apos;s daughter, [[Nōhime]]. Supported by Dōsan, Nobuhide focused on facing Imagawa. In one of his moments of glory, he managed to capture [[Matsudaira Motoyasu]] en route to Imagawa as a hostage. He was thus able to gain some footholds into Mikawa.  His remains are interred in a little known alley near Osu Kannon temple in [[Nagoya]].

==Succession controversy==
When Nobuhide died in 1551 in Owari,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Annales des empereurs du japon, &amp;apos;&amp;apos; p. 381.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; he had designated young Nobunaga to succeed him as the head of the Oda clan and its small domain. Nobunaga, who hardly even knew his father and already had a bad reputation as a delinquent, arrived inappropriately dressed at Nobuhide&amp;apos;s funeral and threw incense at the altar of the temple as he cursed his fate. Almost all support that Nobuhide&amp;apos;s retainers would have given Nobunaga went to younger brother [[Oda Nobuyuki]], instead. For support, Nobunaga was left with [[Hirate Masahide]] and his father-in-law Saitō Dōsan, whom he had never met before. From that point forward, it would take a seven years for Nobunaga to consolidate his power within the clan and finally unite Owari Province.
