&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Odo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eudes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (c. 852 &amp;amp;ndash; 1 January 898) was a King of [[Western Francia]], reigning from 888 to 898. He was a son of [[Robert the Strong]], [[count of Anjou]], whose branch of the family is known as the [[Robertians]]. Odo is also known as the [[Duke of France]] and [[Count of Paris]].

==Origins==
Odo was the eldest son of Robert the Great, Duke of the [[Franks]] and Marquis of [[Neustria]], belonging to the branch known as the Robertians. After his father&amp;apos;s death in 866, Odo inherited his father&amp;apos;s title of Marquis of Neustria. Odo lost this title in 895 when [[Charles the Bald|King Charles the Bald]] appointed Hugh the Abbot to the title, but regained it following the death of Hugh. In the interim, between 890 and 894, he held the post of Count of Paris. Odo was also the lay abbot of St. Martin of Tours.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Ernest Lavisse]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Histoire de France&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, tome ii. (Paris, 1903)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;E. Favre, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eudes, comte de Paris et roi de France&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Paris, 1893)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Odo married [[Théodrate of Troyes]] and had two known sons, Arnulf (born probably about 885) and Guy (born probably about 888), neither of whom lived past the age of fifteen.

For his skill and bravery in resisting the attacks of the [[Vikings]] at the [[Siege of Paris (885-886)|Siege of Paris]], Odo was chosen by the western Franks to be their king following the removal of emperor [[Charles the Fat]]. He was crowned at [[Compiègne]] in February 888 by Walter, Archbishop of Sens.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Gwatking, H. M., Whitney, J. P., et al. Cambridge Medieval History: Volume III—Germany and the Western Empire. Cambridge University Press:London(1930)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Odo continued to battle against the Vikings and defeated them at [[Montfaucon-d&amp;apos;Argonne|Montfaucon]], but he was soon involved in a struggle with powerful nobles who supported the claim of [[Charles the Simple]] to the Frankish throne.

In 889 and 890 Odo granted special privileges to the [[County of Manresa]] in [[County of Osona|Osona]]. Because of its position on the front line against [[Moors|Moorish]] aggression, Manresa was given the right to build towers of defence known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;manresanas&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;manresanes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This privilege was responsible for giving Manresa its unique character, distinct from the rest of Osona, for the next two centuries.

To gain prestige and support, Odo paid homage to the [[East Francia|Eastern Frankish]] King [[Arnulf of Carinthia]]. But in 894 Arnulf declared his support for Charles, and after a conflict which lasted three years, Odo was compelled to come to terms with his rival and surrender a district north of the Seine to him.

Odo died in [[La Fère]] on 1 January 898.
