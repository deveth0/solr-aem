The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oddballs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Comedy show were formed in 1980 by [[Danny Blue (Comedian)|Danny Blue]] and Richard Welsh.
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Oddballs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are a [[comedy]] act in the [[United Kingdom]]. They are best known for their &amp;quot;Naked Balloon Dance&amp;quot;.  They have caused controversy, including an attempt to ban the show from [[Bury St Edmunds]], [[Suffolk]].  Saved only by Robert Everitt, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[councillor]] for the Risbygate Ward, who called it &amp;quot;extremely funny - not at all rude, just risquÃ©&amp;quot;. During the 1980&amp;apos;s the Oddballs founder Danny Blue introduced the outrageous sport of Dwarf Throwing and later went on to win the World Title in Australia (1986)

Adrian Doughty], from the Oddballs, comments &amp;quot;It never ceases to amaze me the bizarre to the ridiculous places we are booked to perform this, so very funny act. A good example I will never forget was a guy in East London whose mother always wished for a toy boy. So it came to pass whilst lying in her coffin, in the crematorium, the Oddballs were confronted with all her loving family, tears and all. As the last beat of the famous instrumental &amp;quot;Wheels&amp;quot; came to an end, so I pushed the button, the curtain closed and to my amazement the tears before me had turned to smile&amp;apos;s...&amp;quot;

Television appearances include &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[EastEnders]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Taggart]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The [[Des O&amp;apos;Connor]] Show&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Big Breakfast]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Salon]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sextasy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Trisha Goddard (TV series)|Trisha]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vanessa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Broker&amp;apos;s Man&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and Portugal&amp;apos;s top television comedy show [[:pt:Levanta-te e ri|Levanta-te E Ri]].

They have also appeared theaters in the London&amp;apos;s [[West End theater|West End]] and across the country touring with [[Jim Davidson (comedian)|Jim Davidson]] in the adult [[pantomime]]s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sinderella&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sinderella Comes Again&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
