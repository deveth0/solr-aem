        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ode Records&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[record label]], started by [[Lou Adler]] in [[1967 in music|1967]] after he sold [[Dunhill Records]] to [[ABC Records]]. It was distributed by [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] until 1969. Between 1970 and 1976 the label was distributed by [[A&amp;amp;M Records]], from 1976 onward it was again distributed by CBS Records.

Adler deactivated the label several times including another short run with A&amp;amp;M in 1989 as Ode Sounds. It was disbanded when A&amp;amp;M was sold to [[PolyGram]] in late [[1989 in music|1989]].

Ode is now part of [[Sony Music Entertainment]] (now the owner of A&amp;amp;M&amp;apos;s one-time distributor [[RCA Records]]), but the [[Cheech &amp;amp; Chong]] catalogue is controlled by [[Warner Music Group]] and the soundtrack to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is still owned by Adler.
