* Although the recording of &amp;quot;Suicyco Mania&amp;quot; is the same one featured on [[How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can&amp;apos;t Even Smile Today]], the mix differs in that all vocals sans the title chant are not present - this original version was the b-side to the [[Trip at the Brain]] single and was added to CD reissues of the album complete with more conventional verse/chorus vocals.
