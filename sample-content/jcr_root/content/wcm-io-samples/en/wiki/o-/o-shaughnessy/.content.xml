[[File:The O&amp;apos;Shaughnessy.jpg|thumb|Sir [[Roger Gilla Dubh Ó Seachnasaigh]]]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ó Seachnasaigh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;O&amp;apos;Shaughnessy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, collectively &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Uí Sheachnasaigh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, clan name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cinél nAedha na hEchtghe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a family surname of Irish origin.

The name is found primarily in [[County Galway]] and [[County Limerick]]. The town of [[Gort]], Ireland, was the main [[house|residence]] of the family since at least the time of their ancestor, King [[Guaire Aidne mac Colmáin]] of the [[Ui Fiachrach Aidhne]] dynasty. Up until the late 17th century the Ó Seachnasaigh&amp;apos;s held the sub district of [[Uí Fiachrach Aidhne]] known as [[Cinéal nAedha na hEchtghe]] meaning &amp;quot;kindred of Aedh of the [[Slieve Aughty]]&amp;quot;, which was also their clan name. Cinéal nAedha na hEchtghe / [[Kinelea]] consisted roughly of the [[civil parish]]es of Beagh, [[Kilmacduagh]] and [[Kiltartan]] and also parts of the civil parishes of Kibeacanty and Kilthomas. Their closest related kinsmen were the [[Ó Cathail]] / O Cahill clan, originally chiefs of eastern [[Kinelea]], and the other clans of Uí Fhiachrach Aidhne the most prominent of which were the [[Ó hEidhin]] / O Hynes, [[Ó Cléirigh]] / O Cleary and [[Mac Giolla Cheallaigh]] / Kilkelly septs. Up until the mid 17th century the O&amp;apos;Hynes clan were still styled lords of Uí Fhiachrach Aidhne even though the Ó Seachnasaigh&amp;apos;s had become more powerful than their kinsmen during this century. In the 1690s Captain [[Roger O&amp;apos;Shaughnessy]] had his lands confiscated for supporting the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause against [[William III of England|William of Orange]] with the lands going to [[Sir Thomas Prendergast, 1st Baronet]]. A legal battle raged on into the first half of the 18th century between the Ó Seachnasaigh and the Prendergasts, the family who were granted the lands, with the Ó Seachnasaigh eventually losing the case. The senior line of the Ó Seachnasaigh&amp;apos;s may have died out in the 1780s.

The last &amp;quot;de facto&amp;quot; Ó Seachnasaigh lord of Kinelea died at [[Gort]] after returning home from the [[Battle of Aughrim]] on 12 July 1691. Thousands of bearers of the name still survive both in their homeland and further abroad.
