&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;O Cortiço&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (titled in {{lang-en|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Slum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}) is an influential Brazilian novel written in 1890 by [[Aluísio Azevedo]]. The novel depicts a part of Brazil&amp;apos;s culture in the late Nineteenth century, represented by a variety of colorful characters living in a single [[Rio de Janeiro]] slum. It is written with the intention of belonging to the [[Literary realism|Realism]] movement leaning towards [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]], much like [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert&amp;apos;s]] [[Madame Bovary]].

Azevedo&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Slum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; tells the stories of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and other European immigrants, [[mulatto]]s, and former [[Slavery in Brazil|African slaves]] living and working together in a single community. It explores the author&amp;apos;s intensely [[Naturalism (literature)#Literature|naturalistic]] beliefs, having various characters being defined and changed by their environment, race and social position.

Examples are: the division between the lackadaisical, yet passionate, mulattos and the hard-working, driven Portuguese immigrants, how the climate and culture of Brazil can slowly transform these immigrants&amp;apos; behavior in atavistic ways. In addition the role of women is a key theme, with all female characters in one way or another revealing their purpose in the slum.
