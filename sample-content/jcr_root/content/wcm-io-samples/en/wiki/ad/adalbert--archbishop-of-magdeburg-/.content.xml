&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Saint Adalbert of Magdeburg&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Saint Albert of Magdeburg&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (died 20 June 981), sometimes known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Apostle of the Slavs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was the first [[Archbishop of Magdeburg]] (from 968)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title= Chambers Biographical Dictionary|last1=Thorne|first1=John|last2=Collocott|first2=T. C.|year=1990|publisher= Chambers|location= Edinburgh|isbn=0-550-16041-8|page= 7|oclc=502219677|origyear=1964}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and a successful missionary to the [[Polabian Slavs|Slavic peoples]] to the east of Germany. He was later [[canonised]]; his feast day is June 20.

==Life==
Adalbert, possibly born in [[Alsace]], was a [[Germany|German]] [[monk]] at the [[Benedictine]] Monastery of Saint Maximinus in [[Trier]]. He was consecrated a [[bishop]] and in 961 he was sent to [[Kievan Rus]]. Princess [[Olga of Kiev]] had asked Emperor [[Otto I the Great|Otto the Great]] to provide her with a [[missionary]] from the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church of Rome]]. Her son, [[Svyatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatoslav]] opposed her and took her [[The Crown|crown]] from her as soon as Adalbert arrived in Kievan Rus. Adalbert&amp;apos;s mission companions were slain and Adalbert was barely able to escape. Kievan Rus subsequently accepted conversion from [[Constantinople]] and [[Eastern Christianity|Byzantine Christianity]].

Upon escaping, Adalbert traveled to [[Mainz]], where he became abbot of [[Wissembourg]] in [[Alsace]]. Once there, he worked to improve the education of the monks. He later became [[archbishop of Magdeburg]], a city in [[Saxony-Anhalt]].

The archbishoprics of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Hamburg]] and [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen]] had been created with the intent that they would act as bases for missionary activity in northern and eastern Europe. The [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]] was now designated to provide missionary programs for the eastern European [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]]. Adalbert also established dioceses at [[Diocese of Naumburg|Naumburg]], [[Diocese of Meissen|Meissen]], [[Diocese of Merseburg|Merseburg]], [[Bishopric of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], [[Diocese of Havelberg|Havelberg]] and [[Diocese of Poznań|Poznań]] in [[Poland]]. A student in Adalbert&amp;apos;s time who went on to do important work among the Slavs was Vojtěch of Prague, later canonized as Saint [[Adalbert of Prague]].
