{{Politics of Serbia_and_Montenegro}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Serbia and Montenegro]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; consisted of two republics, the [[Republic of Serbia (federal)|Republic of Serbia]] and the [[Republic of Montenegro (federal)|Republic of Montenegro]].

==Serbia==
{{main|Subdivisions of Serbia}}
[[Serbia]] had two autonomous provinces:
* [[Vojvodina]] with its capital in [[Novi Sad]] and
* [[Kosovo]] with its capital in [[Priština]] (under [[UN]] 1999-2006)

The part of Serbia that was in neither (often called &amp;quot;[[Central Serbia]]&amp;quot;) was not a province and had no special status. It had no capital nor a governing body.

Independently of this division, Serbia was further divided into 29 [[district]]s (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[okrug]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and the city of [[Belgrade]]. Each of districts (and the city) was further divided into [[municipality|municipalities]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;opština&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

==Montenegro==
{{main|Municipalities of Montenegro}}
[[Montenegro]] was divided into 21 municipalities.
