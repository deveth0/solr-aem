&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ada &amp;quot;Ace&amp;quot; Vélez&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born September 15, 1970) is a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] female professional boxer who lives in [[Hollywood, Florida]]. Vélez was brought into boxing by former [[women&amp;apos;s boxing]] world champion [[Bonnie Canino]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenboxing.com/biog/avelez.htm|title=Ada Velez Biography|publisher=Women Boxing Archive Network|accessdate=2009-01-18}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

After a successful undefeated amateur career that included a national title, Vélez became the first Puerto Rican to win a women&amp;apos;s world boxing championship on January 19, 2001, when she defeated Kathy Williams on a unanimous decision over 10 rounds to win the IBA bantamweight title. Ten months later, she moved up in weight and challenged undefeated [[Mary Elizabeth Ortega]] for the [[Women&amp;apos;s International Boxing Association|WIBA]] super bantamweight title, again winning a 10-round unanimous decision.

Vélez won her first 10 pro fights before suffering her first loss as a professional, in her first defense of the WIBA title. On June 21, 2002, [[Melissa Del Valle]] decisioned Vélez in [[Waco, Texas]] in the featured bout on an all-women&amp;apos;s card featuring world champions [[Anne Wolfe]], [[Sumya Anani]], [[Delia Gonzalez]] and [[Kelsey Jeffries]].

On December 21, she bounced back to reclaim the [[International Boxing Association|IBA]] version of the world bantamweight title by decisioning [[Lakeysha Williams]] over 10 rounds.

Vélez has added the WIBA bantamweight title to her IBA belt on June 28, 2003, when she beat Gonzalez on a seventh-round disqualification.

Vélez traveled to Denmark to defend her WIBA bantamweight title against Anita Christensen. on January 17, 2004, Vélez lost a highly controversial 10 round split decision to Christensen.
Vélez had knocked down Christensen in the 9th round, and looked to be the obvious winner of their encounter. The Danish press strongly criticized this decision, saying on record that Vélez was robbed of her title.

Vélez&amp;apos; current record is 14 wins, 2 loss and 2 draws, with six [[knockout]] wins.
