&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Adrianus Turnebus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-fr|Adrien Turnèbe}} or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tournebeuf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; 1512 &amp;amp;ndash; 12 June 1565) was a French classical scholar.

==Life==
Turnebus was born at [[Les Andelys]] in [[Normandy]]. At the age of twelve he was sent to Paris to study, and attracted great notice by his remarkable abilities. After having held the post of professor of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;belles-lettres&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the [[University of Toulouse]], in 1547 he returned to Paris as professor (or royal reader) of [[Greek literature|Greek]] at the [[Collège de France|College Royal]].  In 1562 he exchanged this post for a professorship in [[Greek philosophy]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Adrian Turnebus}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1552 he was entrusted with the printing of the Greek books at the royal press, in which he was assisted by his friend, [[Guillaume Morel]]. [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] was his pupil. He died of [[tuberculosis]] on 12 June 1565 in Paris.

[[Montaigne]] wrote that he &amp;quot;knew more and better, what he knew, than any man in his age or of many ages past&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Essays&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, book II, ch. 17 (Florio translation)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He was the father of [[Odet de Turnèbe]].

==Works==
His works chiefly consist of [[philology|philological]] dissertations, commentaries (on [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], [[Theophrastus]], [[Philo Judaeus|Philo]] and portions of [[Cicero]]), and translations of Greek authors into [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]]. His son Étienne published his complete works in three volumes (Strassburg, 1600), and his son Adrien published his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Adversaria&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, containing explanations and emendations of numerous passages by classical authors.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2010/2010-02-62.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
