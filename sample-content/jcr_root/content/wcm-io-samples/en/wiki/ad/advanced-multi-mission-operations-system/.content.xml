The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Advanced Multi-Mission Operations System&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AMMOS&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a common set of services and tools created by the [[Interplanetary Network Directorate]], a division of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], for use in JPL&amp;apos;s operation of spacecraft. These tools include a means by which mission planning and analysis can be undertaken, as well as developing pre-planned command sequences for the [[spacecraft]]. AMMOS also provides a means by which downlinked data can be displayed and manipulated, including key mission [[telemetry]] such as readings of temperature, pressure, power, and other critical indicators. This common toolset allows space missions to minimize the cost of developing operations [[infrastructure]], which is very important in light of recent restricted spending by [[outer space|space]] agencies.
