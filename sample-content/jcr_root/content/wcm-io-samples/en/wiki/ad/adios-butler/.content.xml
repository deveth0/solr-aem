The horse &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Adios Butler&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as &amp;quot;The Butler&amp;quot; (1956â€“1983), was a [[North America]]n [[harness racing]] champion.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,895435,00.html |title=Sport: The Butler |accessdate=2010-08-12 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date=1961-06-30 |work= |publisher=TIME Magazine |pages= |quote= }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Father|Sired]] by the great [[Standardbred]] [[Adios (racehorse)|Adios]]  with an obscure broodmare named Debby Hanover, Adios Butler was trained and driven by Clint Hodgins. In [[1959 in sports|1959]], Adios Butler won the [[Cane Pace]], then the [[Little Brown Jug (horse racing)|Little Brown Jug]] where he was the first horse to win with a sub-two-minute mile and finally the [[Messenger Stakes]], doing it in track and stake record time to become the first pacer to ever capture the [[Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers]].

The following year he lost only one race on a muddy track but later would go on to record a 1:54.3 mile, the then fastest time in harness racing history. Adios Butler was named &amp;quot;[[Harness Horse of the Year]]&amp;quot; in 1960 and 1961 by the U.S. Trotting Association and the U.S. Harness Writers Association. After his racing career he would be retired to [[Stud (animal)|stud]].
