&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marco Antonio Silva&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; a.k.a. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;DJ Marky&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Brazil]]ian [[drum and bass]] [[Disc jockey|DJ]].

Together with [[DJ Patife]], [[XRS|XRS Land]] and [[Drumagick]], Brazilians were forging a new sound in drum and bass that became popular around the world with releases such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;LK&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Só Tinha Que Ser Com Você&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Career==
He was brought to the attention of the [[English people|English]] DJ Bryan Gee, head of [[V Recordings]], who saw Marky playing in a club in [[São Paulo]] in 1998. He invited the DJ to play in [[London]].  This experience resulted in a residency at the club Movement, a subsequent residency at [[The End (club)|The End]] club, work for the UK&amp;apos;s [[BBC Radio 1]], and global popularity.

Marky got started in drum and bass in 1992, but by 1997, he went to [[London]] and met [[DJ Hype]] and [[Goldie]]. In 1999, he was awarded &amp;quot;Best New DJ&amp;quot; by the UK music critics. The recording sessions of his album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Working the Mix&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, happened in his house, with two pick ups, one mixer and vinyl albums. His appeal became more widespread after a two hour set on [[BBC Radio 1]]&amp;apos;s [[Essential Mix]] in March 2004, and his album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;In Rotation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 2006, DJ Marky played the [[Lovebox Festival]] in Victoria Park, east London as one of the headline acts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
