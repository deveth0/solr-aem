&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;QI News&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[internet television]] show produced by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quite Interesting Limited&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the company which produces the British [[panel game]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[QI]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It i
was broadcast on [[ComedyBox.tv]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedybox.tv/show-qi|title=QI News|publisher=ComedyBox.tv|accessdate=21 September 2007}}{{Dead link|date=January 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was a mock news programme, which instead of broadcasting news stories, broadcast &amp;quot;quite interesting&amp;quot; stories. Other than the stories, the show also played on the characters in it, mainly the two news readers.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;E1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite episode | url = http://www.comedybox.tv/show-qi-10193 | title = Episode 1 | series = QI News | airdate = 17 September 2007 | number = 1 }}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Show==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;QI News&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a five-minute long show which reported &amp;quot;quite interesting&amp;quot; things from around the world. It was presented by two newsreaders, brash American Bob Squire ([[Glenn Wrage]]) and female Cambridge British co-anchor Sophie Langton ([[Katherine Jakeways]]). Other contributions were sometimes provided by correspondent Graham Prince ([[Robert Meakin]]). Off-screen, the Producer (Voice of [[Alexander McConnell (producer)|Alexander McConnell]]) tried to keep Squire and Langton in order.

Each programme ended with one of the characters mentioning a final fact. The other would say, &amp;quot;Is that news?&amp;quot; to which the first responded, &amp;quot;It&amp;apos;s news to me&amp;quot;. As the credits roll, a disclaimer appeared which read, &amp;quot;All the information in this programme is believed to be true&amp;quot;, followed by humorous comments swearing that it is true.

==Production==
The script for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;QI News&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was written by Meakin and [[Justin Gayner]]. The research for the show was carried out by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;QI&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/nowiki&amp;gt;s &amp;quot;Question Wranglers&amp;quot;, [[John Mitchinson]] and [[Piers Fletcher]], among others. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;QI&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/nowiki&amp;gt;s creator [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] was the [[executive producer]] and it was directed by [[Geoff Posner]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedybox.tv/show-qi|title=QI News|publisher=ComedyBox.tv|date=17 September 2007|accessdate=21 September 2007}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
