According to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Calendars ({{lang-ar|السالنامات العثمانية }}), , the Qishla   was built in 1863 to be the headquarters of the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] army in [[Kirkuk]]. The building is located in the city centre, occupying about {{convert|6|acre|m2}}. The word Qishla is a [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word means the place where the army stay at the winter.
