==At Eurovision==

The increased interest in participating in Eurovision meant that, with the exception of hosts Norway, all other countries had to present their song in an audio only semi-final held in late March. Gina G was placed third with 153 points.[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/national_finals_90s_00s/Presel1996.html&amp;amp;date=2009-10-26+02:40:22]

At the Eurovision final in Oslo things were not so rosy and Gina had to contend with an eighth place, scoring 77 points.

Despite this result, &amp;apos;Just a Little Bit&amp;apos; is one of the most successful of the UK&amp;apos;s entries at Eurovision, not only topping the [[UK singles chart]] but also finding success in America, where the song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording in 1998.
