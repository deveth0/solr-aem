&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ungava Bay&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (French: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;baie d&amp;apos;Ungava&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Inuktitut]] (syllabics/Roman) ᐅᖓᕙ ᑲᖏᖅᓗᒃ/&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ungava kangiqluk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a large [[headlands and bays|bay]] in northeastern [[Canada]] separating [[Nunavik]] (far northern [[Quebec]]) from [[Baffin Island]]. The bay is roughly oval-shaped, about {{convert|260|km|abbr=on}} at its widest point and about {{convert|320|km|abbr=on}} in length; it has an area of approximately {{convert|50000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It is generally fairly shallow, under {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}}, though at its border with the [[Atlantic Ocean]] depths of almost {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} are reached.

==Geography==
There are a number of islands within Ungava Bay. The largest, [[Akpatok Island]], and others north of [[60th parallel north|60°N]] are part of the territory of [[Nunavut]], while smaller islands south of 60°N belong to Quebec.

Although it is quite close to the open Atlantic (separated only by [[Hudson Strait]]), Ungava Bay is generally considered part of the [[Arctic Ocean]] because the land surrounding it has an exceedingly cold climate. Ungava Bay is separated from [[Hudson Bay]] by the [[Ungava Peninsula]]. [[Bathymetry|Bathymetric]] studies suggest Ungava Bay may be the remnant of an [[impact crater]] (age unknown) approximately 225 km in diameter.

The southwestern corner of Ungava Bay, along with [[Bay of Fundy]], has either the highest or second-highest [[tide|tidal ranges]] in the world.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Charles T. O&amp;apos;reilly, Ron Solvason, and Christian Solomon. [http://www.bofep.org/PDFfiles/BoFEP6thProceedings.pdf &amp;quot;Resolving the World&amp;apos;s largest tides&amp;quot;], in J.A Percy, A.J. Evans, P.G. Wells, and S.J. Rolston (Editors) 2005: The Changing Bay of Fundy-Beyond 400 years, Proceedings of the 6th Bay of Fundy Workshop, Cornwallis, Nova Scotia, Sept. 29, 2004 to October 2, 2004. Environment Canada-Atlantic Region, Occasional Report no. 23. Dartmouth, NS and Sackville, NB.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Some sources estimate the [[spring tide]] range at the mouth of the [[Leaf River (Quebec)|Leaf River]] as being as high as {{convert|17|m|abbr=on}}. Attempts have been made to develop tidal power in the bay, but this is made difficult by the harsh climate and the fact that the bay is ice-free for only a small part of the year.

==Climate==
Due to the influence of the [[Labrador Current]], summers are too cold for [[tree]] growth and all the land surrounding the bay is treeless [[tundra]]. Typically, temperatures in summer at [[Kuujjuaq]] about twenty kilometres up the [[Koksoak River]] are about {{convert|7|C}}, while winter temperatures are about {{convert|−20|C}}. [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] averages around {{convert|400|–|450|mm|abbr=on}} per year, most of it falling in the summer.

==Human development==
Ungava Bay is surrounded by numerous [[Inuit]] villages, the largest of which is [[Kuujjuaq, Quebec]], at the mouth of the [[Koksoak River]]. [[Iron ore]] has been mined in the past, but despite the high grade of the ores the impossibility of cheap transportation meant that mining was discontinued in 1980. Traditional Inuit hunting activities still dominate the region&amp;apos;s life, along with expensive adventure [[tourism]].
