The name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;United Rhodesia Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the acronym, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;URP&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, refer to two [[political parties]] in [[Southern Rhodesia]].

The first was the party, led by Sir [[Godfrey Martin Huggins]], and which in 1933 came to power in the colony. It was informally known as the United Party, later formally known as the [[United Federal Party]] (UFP).

The second is the party founded and led by former UFP premier of Southern Rhodesia, Sir [[Garfield Todd]], during the time in which Southern Rhodesia was one of three territories within the [[Central African Federation]] (CAF). This revived URP, which stood to the left of the more centrist UFP, merged with the latter in 1958 following Todd&amp;apos;s defeat in the Territorial elections and the victory of the UFP, led at the time by Sir [[Edgar Whitehead]].
