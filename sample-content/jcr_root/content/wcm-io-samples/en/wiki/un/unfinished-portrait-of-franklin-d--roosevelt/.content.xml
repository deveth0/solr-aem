The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Unfinished Portrait&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[watercolor]] of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] that was in progress at the time of his collapse and subsequent death.

==History==
In 1943, painter [[Elizabeth Shoumatoff]] was told by her friend and client [[Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd]] &amp;quot;You should really paint the President. He has such a remarkable face. There is no painting of him that gives his true expression. I think you could do a wonderful portrait, and he would be such an interesting person to paint! Would you do a portrait of him if it was arranged?&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Museum Announcement 2006&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=MAJOR FDR CENTER MUSEUM ANNOUNCEMENT: APRIL, 2006|url=http://www.fdrheritage.org/shoumatoff.htm|work=FDR CENTER MUSEUM|publisher=FDR CENTER MUSEUM|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Rutherfurd would go on to make the arrangements, with Shoumatoff agreeing to sit in for two days within 2 weeks&amp;apos; time. She said of the agreement: &amp;quot;I was trapped into something I had neither wished for nor planned.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Museum Announcement 2006&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; She went on to talk about not being able to turn down the honor of being selected for a Presidential commission.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Museum Announcement 2006&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Painting==
Elizabeth Shoumatoff had begun working on the portrait of the president around noon on April 12, 1945. Roosevelt was being served lunch when he said &amp;quot;I have a terrific pain in the back of my head.&amp;quot; He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious, and was carried into his bedroom. The president&amp;apos;s attending cardiologist, Dr. Howard Bruenn, diagnosed a massive [[cerebral hemorrhage]] (stroke). Roosevelt never regained consciousness and died at 3:35 p.m. that day. Shoumatoff never finished the portrait.

The Unfinished Portrait hangs at Roosevelt&amp;apos;s former health and relaxation retreat in [[Warm Springs, Georgia]], known as the [[Little White House]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gastateparks.org/net/content/go.aspx?s=49.0.0.5 |title=Georgia State Parks - Roosevelt&amp;apos;s Little White House Historic Site |publisher=Gastateparks.org |date=1945-04-12 |accessdate=2010-02-23}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Later, Shoumatoff decided to finish the portrait in FDR&amp;apos;s memory. She painted a new painting based on memory. One difference is that the tie that was red in the original is now blue in the finished painting. All other aspects are completely identical. The finished portrait now resides in the Legacy Exhibit beside the original at the Little White House Historic Site in [[Warm Springs, Georgia]].
