The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Universal Forum of Cultures&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ca|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fòrum de les Cultures&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}, {{lang-es|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fórum de las culturas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}) is an international cultural event intended to take place every three years. This event is organized by [[Forum Foundation]].

The first Forum was held in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]] ([[Spain]]), from May 9 to September 26, 2004. It was organized by Barcelona&amp;apos;s local council, the Catalan government (the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]]), the Spanish Government and [[UNESCO]]. It was conceived by Catalan prime mover ([[Pasqual Maragall]], then Mayor of Barcelona) as a way of promoting the city&amp;apos;s burgeoning [[tourist industry]] in the wake of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]]. The official aims of the [[2004 Universal Forum of Cultures]] included support for peace, sustainable development, human rights and respect for cultural diversity. However, many [[NGO]]s (including [[Greenpeace]] and [[Amnesty International]]) criticised the event for failing to live up to these lofty ideals and boycotted it as a result.

The event was controversial, with critics pointing to the $2.3 billion price tag and commercial sponsorship by multinationals ([[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]], [[Nestlé]], [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]], [[Telefónica]], and [[Indra sistemas|Indra]]) with dubious reputations in the [[Third World]]. Several groups also criticised the massive property and coastline destruction involved in building the Forum site. This may explain why the Forum fell so far short of its projected attendance figures for the 141-day event. The forecasts were progressively scaled back from the planning stage, to 7 million and then 5 million during the event. The official final attendance figure was around 3.5 million, although even this figure is hotly disputed.

The [[2007 Universal Forum of Cultures]] was held in [[Monterrey]], [[Mexico]]. The event  promoted  Native American  and &amp;quot;White&amp;quot; cultures.

For the third edition (2010), candidate cities were [[Chicago]] ([[USA]]), [[Amsterdam]] ([[Netherlands]]), [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]] ([[Japan]]), [[Alexandria]] ([[Egypt]]), [[Suwon]] and [[Gwangju]] ([[South Korea]]), [[Santiago de Chile]] and [[Valparaíso]] ([[Chile]]), [[Budapest]] ([[Hungary]]) and [[Durban]] ([[South Africa]]). [[Valparaíso]], [[Chile]] was selected as host for the 2010 Universal Forum of Cultures.
[[Naples]], [[Italy]] was selected as host for the 2013 Universal Forum of Cultures, while both [[Quebec City]], [[Canada]] and [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] were selected to host the 2016 forum. Quebec City decided to back off and give Amman the whole organisation of the event.
