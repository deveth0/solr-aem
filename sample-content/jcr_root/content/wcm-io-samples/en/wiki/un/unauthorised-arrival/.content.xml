        text="&lt;p&gt;An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;unauthorised arrival&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a person who has arrived in a [[country]] when they are not a [[citizen]] of that country and does not have a valid [[visa (document)|visa]] or does not satisfy other required conditions for entry to that country.

A person may be described as an unauthorised arrival when they have crossed a [[national border]] with the intention of applying for [[refugee]] status, making them an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[asylum seeker]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. If a person enters a country without authorisation intending to live and work in that country, then they may be, or may become, an [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrant]].

Under the [[United Nations]] [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]], a person has the right to cross national borders if they are seeking asylum from [[political repression]] or various other forms of persecution.

Per the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]], &amp;quot;Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.&amp;quot; There are no caveats listed.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ The Universal Declaration of Human Rights] Article 13, Section 2&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
