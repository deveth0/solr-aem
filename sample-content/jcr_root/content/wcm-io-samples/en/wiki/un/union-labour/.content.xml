In 1922, the largest labour-oriented party in [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]], was the [[Independent Labour Party (in Manitoba) (II)|Independent Labour Party]].  In the provincial election of 1922, the ILP had to compete with other labour candidates from both the left and the right.

The more conservative train unionists nominated two candidates to stand for Winnipeg: [[James Winning]] and [[F.W. McGill]].  These candidates ran under the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Union Labour&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; banner, and were associated with remnants of the old [[Dominion Labour Party (in Manitoba)|Dominion Labour Party]]. They also appear to have been affiliated with the [[Canadian Labour Party]].  Neither candidate was successful, and no further candidates were offered under this label in later years.
