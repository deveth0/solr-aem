The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;1874 British general election in Ireland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; produced the first major electoral appearance of the [[Home Rule League]] under chairman [[Isaac Butt]]. The party&amp;apos;s electoral success, in which it won 60 MPs, taking control of [[Ireland|Irish]] electoral politics from the previously dominant [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] parties was the beginning of a dominance that was to see the party as the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] control the political landscape in Ireland until its wipeout in the [[Irish (UK) general election, 1918|1918 general election in Ireland]].

However its success in 1874 was marred by the lack of unity within the party in the [[British House of Commons]], where many of its members in effect sat as Liberal MPs and voted against their own Irish colleagues. It was not until then chairman [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] in the early 1880s introduced a strict [[whip (politics)|whip]] that the party began to exercise serious influence, and act as a unit, in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]].
