&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Underwoodisaurus milii&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a species of [[Gekkonidae]] also classified as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nephrurus milii&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It is commonly known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;thick-tailed&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;barking gecko&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. These names come from its distinctive plump tail and sharp, barking defensive call.

==Description==
Thick-tailed geckos are reddish-brown with bands of white and yellow spots and paler underbelly. They usually grow to 120â€“140&amp;amp;nbsp;mm in length.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Griffiths&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=Reptiles of the Sydney Region| first=Ken| last=Griffiths| isbn=0-9590203-3-0| publisher=Three Sisters Publications Pty Ltd| year=1987| page=63}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Their original tail is black with several pale bands, however regenerated tails have little pattern. When threatened, they will arch their backs and &amp;quot;bark&amp;quot;. Thick-tailed geckos are found in rocky outcrops across southern Australia, and are slightly more cold-tolerant than many other Australian gecko species.  They are nocturnal, and shelter underneath rocks or in burrows during the day. They feed on [[insects]] and small [[vertebrates]].

Unusually for reptiles, this species forms aggregations in their retreat sites during the day. The reasons for this are unknown. However, it has been shown that this behavior results in a higher aggregate thermal inertia (they stay warmer) than would be found in solitary geckos of this and related kinds in similar circumstances.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Lancaster J, Wilson P, Espinoza RE. 2006. Physiological benefits as precursors of sociality: Why banded geckos band. Animal Behavior 72: 199-207&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In the same source, it was suggested that aggregating for physiological benefits may precede the development of other kinds of social behavior.

==Behaviour==
This species, and some other species of gecko have the unusual habit of licking their eyes after eating, presumeably to keep the eyeshield clean.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Griffiths&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Distribution==
They are found in southern regions of the Australia.

Their distribution in [[Western Australia]] is throughout the southwest, the goldfields, wheatbelt, and nullarbor regions to the east, and to [[Shark Bay, Western Australia|Shark Bay]] in the north. They are also found at the [[Houtman Abrolhos]] and the [[Archipelago of the Recherche]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Bush&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |last=Browne-Cooper |first= Robert|coauthors= Brian Bush, Brad Maryan, David Robinson |title= Reptiles and Frogs in the Bush: Southwestern Australia|year= 2007|month= |publisher= [[University of Western Australia]] Press|isbn= 978-1-920694-74-6 |pages=  128|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Conservation status==
The species has not been assessed for the [[IUCN Red List]], nor the Australian [[EPBC Act]], and may be kept as a pet with the appropriate license in at least some states of Australia.
