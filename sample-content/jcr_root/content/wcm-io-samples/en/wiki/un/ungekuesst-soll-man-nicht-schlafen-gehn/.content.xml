&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ungeküsst soll man nicht schlafen gehn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;You should not go to sleep unkissed&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wer zuletzt küsst...&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;He Who Kisses Last...&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)  is a [[1936 in film|1936]] [[Austria]]n [[comedy film]]. The screenplay was written by [[Fritz Koselka]], the title song was composed by [[Robert Stolz]], and the movie was directed by [[E. W. Emo]].

The film, shot in [[black-and-white|black and white]], starred three of the most popular [[German language|German-speaking]] comedians of the time&amp;amp;mdash;[[Hans Moser (actor)|Hans Moser]], [[Heinz Rühmann]], and [[Theo Lingen]]. In addition, leading roles were played by [[Liane Haid]] and [[Annie Rosar]].

==Plot outline==
Celebrated singer and movie star Edda Vivian (Haid), who has secretly married her lover, Prince Alba ([[Iván Petrovich]]), has arrived in [[Vienna]] as part of a promotional tour. Her manager, Toni Miller (Lingen), who is completely unaware of her married state and the husband she is hiding in her [[suite (hotel)|hotel suite]], has arranged a [[publicity stunt]]&amp;amp;mdash;an [[auction]] to be held at a [[ball (dance)|ball]] where Edda Vivian is supposed to give a [[kiss]] to the highest bidder, with the money to be given to [[Charitable organization|charity]].

At the same time Franz Angerer (Rühmann), a student of [[philology]], arrives in Vienna, where he wants to attend a conference. He is put up by his Uncle Ferdinand ([[Karl Hellmer]]), who works as a [[Domestic worker|butler]] for Direktor Wiesinger (Moser in rather an unusual role), the owner of a [[gramophone record|record]] company. In the course of the action Angerer is mistaken for several other people, in particular Prince Alba. However, he only has eyes for Wiesinger&amp;apos;s daughter, Dore ([[Susi Lanner]]). The [[happy ending]] consists in the real Prince Alba showing himself to the public together with his wife Edda Vivian, and in Franz Angerer, who by his wit has made her sign an exclusive contract with Wiesinger&amp;apos;s company, becoming engaged to Dore.
