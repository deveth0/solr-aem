&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Unknown Road&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the second [[album]] by [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], released on August 17, 1993 through [[Epitaph Records]]. After frontman [[Jim Lindberg]] briefly left the band during touring in support of its previous album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pennywise (album)|Pennywise]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1991), Pennywise began the recording sessions for their second album. Released a year before the success of [[punk rock in California]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Unknown Road&amp;apos;&amp;apos; gained Pennywise supporting slots on national and world tours with bands such as [[The Offspring]] (who was just about to hit the mainstream with then-new album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). Some archived footage of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Unknown Road&amp;apos;&amp;apos; tour dates can be seen on the band&amp;apos;s 1995 documentary &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Home Movies (video)|Home Movies]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Like their self titled debut album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pennywise (album)|Pennywise]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Unknown Road&amp;apos;&amp;apos; failed to chart in [[Billboard magazine]]. This would be Pennywise&amp;apos;s last uncharted album to date.

==Background and recording==
In 1989, Pennywise released the vinyl only EPs &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[A Word from the Wise]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wildcard (Pennywise EP)|Wildcard]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (which were both re-released on [[Wildcard/A Word from the &amp;apos;Wise|CD]] in 1992). Thanks to the success of the EPs, [[Epitaph Records]] (a label owned by [[Bad Religion]] guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]]) saw the band&amp;apos;s potential and signed them in 1990. In the following year, Pennywise managed to release their first album for the label, which is [[Pennywise (album)|self-titled]]. The album quickly spread throughout the punk community, earning the band some nation-wide recognition. Lyrics in the album endorsed a positive mental attitude, helping promote progressive ideals for [[Generation X]]. Lindberg left the band soon after the debut record. Bass player [[Randy Bradbury]] joined the lineup as Thirsk took over lead vocal duties. In 1992, [[The Vandals]] lead singer Dave Quackenbush took over on vocals for a brief stint. Bradbury left the band and Thirsk returned to bass (Bradbury would rejoin Pennywise permanently after Thirsk&amp;apos;s death in 1996). During the 1991-1992 tour, Pennywise began writing their second album, entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Unknown Road&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. After Lindberg returned to the fold in 1992, they managed to begin recording their new album at [[Westbeach Recorders]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood, California]] with producer Joe Peccerillo.
