==History==
Union Bank of India (UBI) was registered on 11 November 1919 as a limited company in [[Mumbai]] and was inaugurated by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. At the time of India&amp;apos;s Independence in 1947, UBI still only had four branches - three in Mumbai and one in [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], all concentrated in key trade centres. After Independence UBI accelerated its growth and by the time the government nationalized it in 1969, it had grown to 240 branches in 28 states. Shortly after nationalization, UBI merged in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Belgaum Bank&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a private sector bank established in 1930 that had itself merged in a bank in 1964, the Shri Jadeya Shankarling Bank. Then in 1985 UBI merged in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Miraj State Bank&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which had been established in 1929. In 1999 the [[Reserve Bank of India]] requested that UBI acquire &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sikkim Bank&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in a rescue after extensive irregularities had been discovered at the non-scheduled bank. Sikkim Bank had eight branches located in the North-east, which was attractive to UBI.

UBI began its international expansion in 2007 with the opening of representative offices in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and Shanghai, Peoples Republic of China. The next year, UBI established a branch in Hong Kong, its first branch outside India. In 2009, UBI opened a representative office in Sydney, Australia.

At present, the offshore banking operations of Union Bank of India are lead by its branches in Hong kong and newly opened branch in Dubai at Dubai International Financial Centre.
