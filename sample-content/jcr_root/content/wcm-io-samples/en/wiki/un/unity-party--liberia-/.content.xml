The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Unity Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (UP) is a [[List of political parties in Liberia|political party]] in [[Liberia]] that was started in 1984 by [[Edward Kesselly|Edward B. Kesselly]], also its first standard bearer.  Officially founded at [[Buchanan, Liberia|Buchanan]] in [[Grand Bassa County]], the party was established on 27 July 1985.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;UP To Do Formal Launching Tomorrow&amp;quot;.  &amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt;[Monrovia]&amp;lt;/nowiki&amp;gt; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;SunTimes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1985-07-26: 1/13.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The Unity Party participated in the [[Liberian general election, 1985|first elections]] after the [[People&amp;apos;s Redemption Council|1980 coup]], running against then-President [[Samuel Doe]] in October 1985.  The Party has remained active in Liberian politics since, and is now the ruling party in the Republic.

In the previous [[Liberia elections, 1997|elections]] held on 19 July 1997, the UP presidential candidate [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] won 9.58% of the vote. The party won 7 of 64 seats in the [[House of Representatives of Liberia|House of Representatives]] and 3 of 26 in the [[Senate of Liberia|Senate]]. While international observers deemed the polls administratively free and transparent, they noted that it had taken place in an atmosphere of intimidation because most voters believed that former rebel leader and [[National Patriotic Party]] (NPP) candidate [[Charles G. Taylor|Charles Taylor]] would return to [[First Liberian Civil War|war]] if defeated.

Unity Party&amp;apos;s candidate [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] won the [[Liberia elections, 2005|2005 presidential elections]],  besting [[George Weah]] of the [[Congress for Democratic Change]] (CDC) in a [[Two-round system|run-off]].  The party also won 3 seats in the [[Senate of Liberia|Senate]] and 8 in the [[House of Representatives of Liberia|House of Representatives]]. The merger of the [[Liberia Unification Party]] and the [[Liberian Action Party]] into the Unity Party on 1 April 2009 substantially increased its representation in the Legislature.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.theliberianjournal.com/index.php?st=news&amp;amp;sbst=details&amp;amp;rid=974&amp;amp;comesOfTheHome=1 UP, LAP, LUP Mergedâ€(sic)¦Ellen Says Itâ€™s(sic) A Dream Come True], The Liberian Journal, Jimmey C.
