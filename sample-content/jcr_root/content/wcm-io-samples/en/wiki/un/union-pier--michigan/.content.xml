        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Union Pier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] in [[Berrien County, Michigan|Berrien County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]. It is situated between the [[Lake Michigan]] shore and the [[Galien River]] about five miles north of the [[Indiana]] state border.

Union Pier is at coordinates {{coord|41|49|41|N|86|41|33|W}}. The [[ZIP code]] is 49129 and the [[FIPS place code]] is 81400.

During the summer of 1914 a colony of Chicago [[Bohemianism|bohemians]], including the writers [[Sherwood Anderson]] and [[Ben Hecht]], vacationed at the &amp;quot;Camp&amp;apos;s Cottages&amp;quot; (for the owner Eli Camp) on the Union Pier beach. The local residents were outraged by what they believed were the wild goings-on at &amp;quot;The Nudist Club,&amp;quot; as they characterized it, particularly after two local men left their wives for women staying at Camp&amp;apos;s. The locals made the situation sufficiently uncomfortable for the vacationers that they did not return the next year.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Rideout, Walter Bates, and Charles E. Modlin (2006). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sherwood Anderson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. pp. 187-90&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

After the end of [[World War II]], many [[Lithuanian Americans|Lithuanian]] immigrants began settling in Union Pier. Although few Lithuanian-Americans remain today, several Lithuanian facilities remain, such as Milda&amp;apos;s Corner Market and Gintaras Resort.

Union Pier is also one of the few [[Harbor Country]] villages with its own 1 watt radio station, occasionally broadcasting at 87.9 FM using the moniker &amp;quot;Radio Mykros&amp;quot;. Programming varies and includes talk and music, some of which is rather obscure and can contain clips from such bands as [[Nektar]], [[Guru Guru]], and [[SBB (band)|SBB]].
