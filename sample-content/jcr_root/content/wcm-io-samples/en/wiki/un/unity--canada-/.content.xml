&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Unity&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Progressive Unity&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the name used in [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]], by a [[popular front]] party initiated by the [[Communist Party of Canada]] for the [[Saskatchewan general election, 1938|1938 Saskatchewan]] and [[Canadian federal election, 1940|1940 Canadian election]].

Under this label, two Saskatchewan [[Legislative Assembly|MLA]]s were elected and [[Dorise Nielson]] was elected to the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Nielson was a supporter of the Communist Party and ran for re-election in [[Canadian federal election, 1945|1945 federal election]] as a [[Labour Progressive Party of Canada|Labour Progressive Party]] candidate (the name adopted by the Communist Party after it was banned) and was defeated.

==United Progressive==
In the 1940 federal election, [[William Halina]] sought election to the Canadian House of Commons in the [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Vegreville (electoral district)|Vegreville]], [[Alberta]] under the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;United Progressive&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; banner.  Halina won 2,727 votes, or 19.4% of the total cast, placing third behind the [[Social Credit Party of Canada|Social Credit]] and [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] candidates, but ahead of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] candidate.

His campaign may have been related to the [[Progressive Unity]] platform that elected communist [[Dorise Nielsen]] in Saskatchewan in the same election. Halina ran for the communist [[Labour-Progressive Party]] in the 1945 election.
