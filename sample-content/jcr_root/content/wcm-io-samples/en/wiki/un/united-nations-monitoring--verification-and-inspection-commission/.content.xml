The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;UNMOVIC&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was created through the adoption of [[United Nations Security Council]] [[UN Security Council Resolution 1284|resolution 1284]] of 17 December 1999.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;UN_SRES12841999&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1284(1999) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=1999 |resolution_number=1284 |accessdate=2008-04-10|date=17 December 1999}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

UNMOVIC was to replace the former [[United Nations Special Commission]] (UNSCOM) and continue with the latter&amp;apos;s mandate to disarm [[Iraq]] of its [[weapons of mass destruction]], and to operate a system of ongoing monitoring and verification to check Iraq&amp;apos;s compliance with its obligations not to reacquire the same weapons prohibited to it by the Security Council.

Following the mandate of the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441]],&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;UN_SRES14412002&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1441(2002) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=2002 |resolution_number=1441 |accessdate=2008-07-23|date=8 November 2002}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The president of Iraq, [[Saddam Hussein]], allowed UN inspectors to return to Iraq in November 2002. UNMOVIC led inspections of alleged chemical and biological facilities in Iraq until shortly before the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|U.S. invasion of Iraq]] in March 2003, but did not find any weapons of mass destruction.

Based on its inspections and examinations during this time, UNMOVIC inspectors determined that UNSCOM had successfully dismantled Iraq’s unconventional weapons program during the 1990s.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

The mandate of UNMOVIC was terminated on 29 June 2007.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;UN_SRES17622007&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1762(2007) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=2007 |resolution_number=1762 |accessdate=2008-07-23|date=29 June 2007}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
