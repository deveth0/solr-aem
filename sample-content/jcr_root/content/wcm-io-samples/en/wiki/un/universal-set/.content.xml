{{about|the largest set in some set theories|a proper class|universe (mathematics)|the meaning in probability theory|sample space}}
In [[set theory]], a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;universal set&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] which contains all objects, including itself.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Forster 1995 p. 1.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In [[set theory]] as usually formulated, the conception of a set of all sets leads to a [[paradox]]. The reason for this lies with [[Zermelo]]&amp;apos;s [[axiom of comprehension]]: for any formula &amp;lt;math&amp;gt;\varphi(x)&amp;lt;/math&amp;gt; and set {{mvar|A}}, there exists a set
:&amp;lt;math&amp;gt;\{x \in A \mid \varphi(x)\}&amp;lt;/math&amp;gt;
which contains exactly those elements {{mvar|x}} of {{mvar|A}} that satisfy &amp;lt;math&amp;gt;\varphi&amp;lt;/math&amp;gt;.  If the universal set&amp;amp;nbsp;{{mvar|V}} existed and the axiom of separation applied to it, then [[Russell&amp;apos;s paradox]] would arise from
:&amp;lt;math&amp;gt;\{x \in V\mid x\not\in x\}&amp;lt;/math&amp;gt;.

Generally, for any set {{mvar|A}} we can prove that
:&amp;lt;math&amp;gt;\{x \in A\mid x\not\in x\}&amp;lt;/math&amp;gt;

is not an element of {{mvar|A}}.

A second difficulty is that the [[power set]] of the set of all sets would be a subset of the set of all sets, provided that both exist.  This conflicts with Cantor&amp;apos;s theorem that the power set of any set (whether infinite or not) always has strictly higher [[cardinality]] than the set itself.

The idea of a universal set seems intuitively desirable in the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], particularly because most versions of this theory do allow the use of quantifiers over all sets (see [[universal quantifier]]).  This is handled by allowing carefully circumscribed mention of {{mvar|V}} and similar large collections as [[Class (set theory)|proper classes]].  In theories in which the universe is a proper class, &amp;lt;math&amp;gt;V \in V&amp;lt;/math&amp;gt; is not true because [[proper class]]es cannot be elements.

== Set theories with a universal set ==
There are set theories known to be [[consistent]] (if the usual set theory is consistent) in which the universal set {{mvar|V}} does exist (and &amp;lt;math&amp;gt;V \in V&amp;lt;/math&amp;gt; is true).  In these theories, Zermelo&amp;apos;s [[axiom of separation]] does not hold in general, and the [[axiom of comprehension]] of [[naive set theory]] is restricted in a different way.

The most widely studied set theory with a universal set is [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]’s [[New Foundations]]. [[Alonzo Church]] and [[:de:Arnold Oberschelp|Arnold Oberschelp]] also published work on such set theories.  Church speculated that his theory might be extended in a manner consistent with Quine’s,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Church 1974 p. 308. See also Forster 1995 p. 136 or 2001 p. 17.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; but this is not possible for Oberschelp’s, since in it the singleton function is provably a set,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Oberschelp 1973 p. 40.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; which leads immediately to paradox in New Foundations.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Holmes 1998 p. 110.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and related set theories, which are based on the idea of the [[cumulative hierarchy]], do not allow for the existence of a universal set.
