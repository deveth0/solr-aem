The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;1859 British general election in Ireland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; produced one of the last overall victories for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tories]] in Ireland. Their win, however, did not mean that [[Ireland]] was supporting the Tories, though the party did have some strong pockets of support on the island. The win was a result of a restricted electoral [[Suffrage|franchise]] which saw voting restricted to the middle and upper classes, who were disproportionately supportive of the Tory Party in Ireland.

Electoral reform in subsequent decades saw a sharp decline in Tory fortunes in Ireland, with new voters, who had not been Tory supporters anyhow, supporting first of all the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], notably in the [[Irish (UK) general election, 1868|1868 general election in Ireland]] and later the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] from the [[Irish (UK) general election, 1874|1874 general election in Ireland]] onwards.
