&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Unterschleißheim&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a town in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. It is located about 10 km north of the city limits of [[Munich]], and has a population of 27,106 (December 31, 2007).

==History==
Unterschleißheim was first mentioned in 785.  During [[World War II]], a women&amp;apos;s subcamp of [[Dachau concentration camp]] was located here.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/2006/Unterschleissheim.htm Edward Victor.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Alphabetical List of Camps]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The town&amp;apos;s 1200th anniversary in 1985 incorporated the inauguration of the new town center with the Town Hall and Citizens Advice Bureau.  On December 16th, 2000, Unterschleißheim was granted [[Town privileges|privileges of a town]], known as &amp;apos;Stadtrecht&amp;apos; in German.

Unterschleißheim&amp;apos;s coat of arms symbolises the city&amp;apos;s past and present. The shield of the coat of arms is divided. The upper part shows a golden zigzag line on a blue background. The lower part incorporates a green branch of a spruce and a green oak leaf on a golden background. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.unterschleissheim.de/_Media/image/kultur/wappenCropped.gif Coat of Arms, Unterschleißheim]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Unterschleißheim is the home of a corporate office of [[Adobe Systems]], as well as the headquarters of [[Microsoft]]&amp;apos;s subsidiary in Germany and for Eastern Europe.

==Recreation==
Lake Unterschleißheim was created from 1979-1980 by extracting fill to build the Autobahn.  Over the past 3 decades it has become an almost natural lake, with an ecologically balanced zone, a conservation area for seabirds during the nesting season, and a damp biotop covering {{convert|26|acre|m2}} of land, of which roughly {{convert|18|acre|m2}} is used for sunbathing.  With numerous shallow areas this is a popular summer gathering area for families with children,  and used frequently for ice skating and [[curling]] in the winter.

==Transport==
Unterschleißheim is situated at the crossroads of two Autobahns, the [[Bundesautobahn_99|A99]] and A92, with direct routes to [[Stuttgart]], [[Nuremberg]] and the  [[Munich Airport|Munich Airport Franz Josef Strauß]]. Two [[S-Bahn]] stations on the [[Munich–Regensburg railway|Munich–Regensburg line]], served by [[S1_(Munich)|S1]] trains, connect Unterschleißheim with the regional rail system.
