        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Unsu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (雲手), literally &amp;quot;cloud hands&amp;quot;, is the most advanced [[kata]] found in the [[Shotokan]], [[Shito ryu|Shito-Ryu]] and [[IsshinShorinji Ryu]] [[karate]] styles and to yudansha of [[Seiyo Shorin-Ryu Karate and Kobudo]] and is generally taught to [[karateka]] at the 3rd to 4th [[Dan (rank)|Dan]].  It contains many intricate hand techniques, such as the ippon-nukite (one finger strike) in the opening sequence. Unsu also contains a 360-degree spinning double-kick with a double-leg take down at the same time, landing on the floor face-down before continuing. Because of this, it is a very common kata in tournaments.

The origin of Unsu is unknown.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} It is somewhat a condensation of other [[Shotokan#Kata|kata]]s (e.g., Bassai, Kanku, Jion, Empi, Jitte and Gankaku), hence it is essential to have mastered these before practicing Unsu. The movement, Unsu, or hands in the cloud, is used to sweep away the hands of the opponent and is said to signify the gathering clouds in a thunderstorm.  It consists of 48 moves.
