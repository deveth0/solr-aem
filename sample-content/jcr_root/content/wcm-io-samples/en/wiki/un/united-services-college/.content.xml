&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;United Services College&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an English  private boys&amp;apos; [[public school (England)|public boarding school]] for the sons of [[military officer]]s, located at [[Westward Ho!]] near [[Bideford]] in North [[Devon]].  It was intended to prepare its pupils for [[military academies]], such as [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]].

==History==
The college was founded in 1874 and was absorbed by the [[Imperial Service College]] in 1906, which in turn merged with [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Haileybury]] school in 1942.

As at virtually all boys&amp;apos; schools of its era, [[school corporal punishment|corporal punishment]] (strokes of the [[caning|cane]]) was used, but USC was very unusual in that the cane was applied to the student&amp;apos;s upper back (as described by Kipling) rather than the buttocks.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
