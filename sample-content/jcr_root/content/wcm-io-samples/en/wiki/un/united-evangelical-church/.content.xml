        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;United Evangelical Church&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was created in 1891 when some members of the [[Evangelical Association]] left to form the new church.  Thirty-one years later the two groups reunited in [[Detroit]] and renamed themselves &amp;quot;The Evangelical Church.&amp;quot; (Those congregations who chose not to re-unite formed a body called the [[Evangelical Congregational Church]].)

In 1946, the Evangelical Church merged with the [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ|United Brethren in Christ]] at a meeting in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown, PA]] to form the [[Evangelical United Brethren|Evangelical United Brethren Church]].  This body, in turn, united with the American Methodist Church in 1968 to form the [[United Methodist Church]].
