Before commissioning, she is referred to as &amp;quot;Pre Commissioning Unit&amp;quot; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;PCU&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |title= Navy Christens Guided-Missile Destroyer &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Michael Murphy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

From the early beginnings of the U.S. Navy there had been no standard method of referring to U.S. Navy ships until 1907 when President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order]] 549 on 8 January stating that all US Navy ships were to be referred to as &amp;quot;The name of such vessel, preceded by the words, United States Ship, or the letters U.S.S., and by no other words or letters&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref Name=&amp;quot;USNSN&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

Today&amp;apos;s Navy Regulations define the classification and status of naval ships and craft:

#The Chief of Naval Operations shall be responsible for ... the assignment of classification for administrative purposes to water-borne craft and the designation of status for each ship and service craft. ....
#Commissioned vessels and craft shall be called &amp;quot;United States Ship&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;U.S.S.&amp;quot;
#Civilian manned ships, of the [[Military Sealift Command]] or other commands, designated &amp;quot;active status, in service&amp;quot; shall be called &amp;quot;United States Naval Ship&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;U.S.N.S.&amp;quot;
#Ships and service craft designated &amp;quot;active status, in service,&amp;quot; except those described by paragraph 3 of this article, shall be referred to by name, when assigned, classification, and hull number (e.g., &amp;quot;HIGH POINT PCH-1&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;YOGN-8&amp;quot;).
