The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;United American Free Will Baptist Church&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the oldest national body of predominantly [[Black Americans|black]] [[Free Will Baptists]] in the [[United States]].

==History==

The [[Free Will Baptist Church]] in America grew up on two separate fronts: [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] and [[Southern United States|South]].  In the South the denomination began in 1727 when Paul Palmer started a church in [[Chowan County|Chowan]], [[North Carolina]]. The work in the north began with a congregation organized by [[Benjamin Randall]] in 1780 at [[New Durham, New Hampshire]]. Though they arose independently and there was no organizational connection between them, both taught the doctrines of free grace, free salvation and [[free will]].

[[Free negro|Free blacks]] and [[Slavery in the United States|black slaves]] were members of predominantly [[White American|white]] Free Will Baptist congregations of the South. African-Americans organized their first separate congregation, Shady Grove Free Will Baptist Church, at Snow Hill, Greene County, [[North Carolina]], in 1867. The first annual conference was organized in 1870, and the first association in 1887. The first General Conference for United Free Will Baptists convened at St. John&amp;apos;s church in [[Kinston, North Carolina]], on  May 8, 1901. The greatest strength of this body is in North Carolina, where it maintains headquarters and a tabernacle and operates [[Kinston College]]in North Carolina. There are about 50,000 members in 250 churches. The General Conference has published a book of discipline since 1903 and publishes a periodical called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Free Will Baptist Advocate&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The United American Free Will Baptist Church is a member of the [[National Fraternal Council of Negro Churches]].

In 1968, a division brought about a second group of black Free Will Baptists, the [[United American Free Will Baptist Conference]].
