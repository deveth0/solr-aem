&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Universities UK&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[advocacy organisation]] for universities in the [[United Kingdom]].  It began life as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals of the Universities of the United Kingdom (CVCP)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the nineteenth century when there were informal meetings involving [[chancellor (education)|vice-chancellor]]s of a number of universities and principals of university colleges. The current President is [[Eric Thomas (academic)|Professor Eric Thomas]], Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Bristol]].

In 1918 the first consultative meeting of all vice-chancellors was held. At that time, the committee consisted of just twenty-two universities and university colleges. In 1930, under the chairmanship of Sir [[Charles Grant Robertson]], vice-chancellors secured a mandate from their respective universities that &amp;quot;it is desirable in the common interests of the United Kingdom to constitute a Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals for purposes of mutual consultation&amp;quot;.

In the early 80s, they commissioned the [[Jarratt report]], published in 1985, and which framed universities as businesses delivering a product to student-consumers.

Over the succeeding years the number of universities increased as a result of new universities being created and the change in legislation in 1992, which recognised the former polytechnics as universities thus doubling and diversifying the membership.

On 1 December 2000, CVCPâ€™s name, logo and identity were changed to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Universities UK&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in order to reflect changes which had taken place in the organisation in recent years.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/1048326.stm BBC News &amp;apos;&amp;apos;University chiefs shed &amp;apos;grey&amp;apos; image&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1 December 2000]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Universities UK&amp;apos;s task is to support the work of universities and promote their interests. It works to deliver its mission by speaking out for a thriving and diverse higher education sector which creates benefits for all; providing and disseminating essential information; bringing people together to share knowledge and good practice.

There is also an additional group, [[Universities Scotland]], whose membership comprises the Universities UK members in [[Scotland]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Universities Scotland&amp;apos;&amp;apos; promotes and supports the work of Universities UK.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.universities-scotland.ac.uk/index.php?page=links&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
