The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;University of San Antonio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[United Methodist Church|Methodist]] institution of [[higher education]] located in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], USA.  It was founded as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;San Antonio Female College&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1894.  The name was changed to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Westmoorland College&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1918 and to the University of San Antonio in 1937.  In 1942, the campus was taken over by [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]], which adopted the [[alumni]] of the University of San Antonio.  Trinity, in turn, built a new campus and left the old University of San Antonio campus in 1952.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Note&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: This university was not related to the later [[University of Texas at San Antonio]] (UTSA).
