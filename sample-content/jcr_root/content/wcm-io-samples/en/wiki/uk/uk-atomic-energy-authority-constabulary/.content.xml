        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority Constabulary&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the armed [[security police]] force of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]]. The force existed for 50 years, up until 1 April 2005.

On 1 April 2005, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Civil Nuclear Constabulary]] (CNC)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was established in adherence to the Energy Act 2004, replacing the UKAEA Constabulary largely because a number of nuclear sites were poorly guarded, and that a force with more specialist attributes was needed to combat the possibility of terrorist threats. The force is now made up of 650 armed personnel (the majority of whom were from the UKAEA Constabulary), protecting sixteen atomic sites and protecting transportation of nuclear materials around the United Kingdom.
