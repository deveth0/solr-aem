The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;UKRD Group Ltd&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a British media company which owns 16 commercial [[radio stations]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The name originates from UK Radio Developments.

==History==
Formed on 22 August 1990 as a company to invest in commercial stations following the relaxation of station ownership laws, its first investment was a stake in [[Cornwall]]&amp;apos;s [[Pirate FM 102]] which was designed and launched by former [[County Sound]] boss [[Mike Powell (UK radio entrepreneur)|Mike Powell]] who, after leaving County Sound, had formed Infinity Radio. Shortly after the launch, Infinity Radio merged with UK Radio Developments and Powell became CEO of the embryonic UKRD Group. Under Powell&amp;apos;s leadership, UKRD became one of the fastest growing private radio groups in the UK, rapidly adding [[Star FM]] in Slough and winning the [[Guildford]] radio franchise which gave birth to [[96.4 The Eagle]], the new County Sound (a recreation of the original Guildford commercial station of the same name) and [[Delta Radio (97.1, 101.6, 101.8 and 102.0 FM)|Delta Radio]]. Since then it has acquired several more stations, and launched further stations on the issue of new local licences.

UKRD acquired a significant minority share-holding in [[Faze FM]] which ran [[Kiss 102]] in [[Manchester]] and [[Kiss 105]] in [[Yorkshire]]. The stations had a branding deal with [[EMAP]]&amp;apos;s [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss FM, London]]. UKRD sold its interests in the Kiss stations in 1997 to the [[Chrysalis Group]] who added them to its [[Galaxy Radio]] network.

Since 2001, the head of the organisation has been William Rogers, one time leader of [[Penwith]] District Council, in [[Cornwall]].

UKRD Group&amp;apos;s head office is within the [[Carn Brea]] Studios of [[Pirate FM 102]] in [[Redruth]], [[Cornwall]]. It also has offices in Guildford and [[Bristol]].

In 2009, it acquired [[The Local Radio Company]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/may/14/ukrd-local-radio-company-hallwood Media Guardian]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and disposed of many non-profitable stations, as well as re-branding [[Alpha Radio]], [[Minster Northallerton]] and [[Durham FM]] into [[Star Radio North East]].

In March 2010 it was ranked twenty-seventh in the Sunday Times Best Companies to Work For (SMEs).

In March 2011 it was ranked 1st in the Sunday Times Best Companies to Work For.

In March 2012 it was ranked 1st in the Sunday Times Best Companies to Work For.

In March 2013 it was ranked 1st in the Sunday Times Best Companies to Work For.
