Heather Phares of Allmusic.com rated &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Audio&amp;apos;&amp;apos; three out of five stars. She explained that it &amp;quot;reflects over a decade&amp;apos;s worth of musical and theatrical innovation.&amp;quot; Although she stated that &amp;quot;the spectacle of the group playing its sculptural, surreal-looking instruments is absent from the album,&amp;quot; she concluded her review by calling it &amp;quot;an album that proves the Blue Man Group is as innovative in the studio as it is onstage.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=AMG /&amp;gt;
