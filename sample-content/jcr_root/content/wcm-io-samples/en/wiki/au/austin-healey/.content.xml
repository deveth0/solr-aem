&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Austin-Healey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a British sports car maker. The marque was established through a joint-venture arrangement, set up in 1952 between [[Leonard Lord]] of the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] division of the [[British Motor Corporation]] (BMC) and the [[Donald Healey Motor Company]], a renowned automotive engineering and design firm.

Austin-Healey cars were produced until 1972 when the 20-year agreement between [[Donald Healey Motor Company|Healey]] and Austin came to an end. Donald Healey left the company in 1968 when [[British Motor Holdings]] (BMC had merged with [[Jaguar Cars]] in 1966 to form BMH) was merged into [[British Leyland]]. Healey joined [[Jensen Motors]] who had been making bodies for the &amp;quot;[[the Big Healeys|big Healeys]]&amp;quot; since their inception in 1952, and became their chairman in 1972.

The MG was aimed slightly upmarket, and as there was no bugeye midget, the &amp;quot;mark&amp;quot; numbers are offset by 1; for example, except for the badges and price a fully optioned Mk II Sprite was identical to a base level Mk I Midget.
* 1961–1964 AN6–AN7 Mark II

==Racing==
The Austin Healey was extensively raced by the Donald Healey Motor Company in Europe at Le Mans and in Sebring in the U.S., in classic rallies by the BMC competitions department, and was recognized from the very beginning by the [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA). Healey models raced in club racing in D, E, and F production classes, winning National Championships in both D and E Production. The last Big Healey to win an SCCA National Championship was the class E Production Austin-Healey 100-6 driven by Alan Barker at the Daytona ARRC in 1965.

In 1953, a special streamlined Austin-Healey set several land speed records at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in Utah, USA.

==Successors==
The name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Austin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is now owned by [[Nanjing Automobile (Group) Corporation|Nanjing]] who bought the assets of  [[MG Rover Group]] (British Leyland&amp;apos;s successor company) out of bankruptcy in 2005. After Donald Healey sold his original business, [[Donald Healey Motor Company]], the Healey brand was registered to a new firm, [[Healey Automobile Consultants]], which the Healey family sold to [[HFI Automotive]] in 2005.

In June 2007, [[Nanjing Automobile (Group) Corporation|Nanjing]] and [[Healey Automobile Consultants]] / [[HFI Automotive]] signed a collaborative agreement that aims to recreate the Austin Healey and Healey marquees alongside NAC&amp;apos;s MG. No timeline has been given as to when the Healey and Austin-Healey brands will return, although MG will be back on the market in China and the UK by the year&amp;apos;s end.
