&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Autoerotic fatalities&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are [[death]]s that occur during sexual activity when an action, chemical, device or prop that is being employed to enhance physical or psychological stimulation causes the death.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2014571/Owner-killer-bear-Sam-Mazzola-chained-bed-choking-death-sex-toy.html | work=Daily Mail | first=Fiona | last=Roberts | title=Owner of killer bear found chained to his bed after &amp;apos;choking to death on sex toy&amp;apos;}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; These deaths may be accidental, natural or homicidal and occur in connection with consensual acts, criminal sexual assaults, or [[autoeroticism|autoerotic acts]]. The term is often applied to only those deaths related to solitary sexual practices such as [[self-bondage]] and [[autoerotic asphyxia]]. In some cases autoerotic fatalities are not initially recognized, and are confused with sexual homicide or [[suicide]], but suicide by autoerotic means is extremely uncommon.

Causes of autoerotic deaths included the use of chemicals such as [[amyl nitrite]], [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]], or [[nitrous oxide]], and props and tools such as knives, oversized dildos, ligatures or bags for asphyxiation, duct tape, electrical apparatus for shocks, water for self-immersion, fire-making equipment for self-immolation, or sharp, unhygienic or large fetishized objects. Male victims are much more likely to use a variety of devices during autoerotic behaviour than female victims.

The most common causes of death in autoerotic fatalities are [[asphyxia]] by  [[strangulation]], suffocation, chemical or [[postural asphyxia|postural]] asphyxia. These causes dominate autoerotic deaths to such an extent that other forms of autoerotic death are termed atypical. Atypical deaths are through causes such as [[electric shock|electrocution]], [[sepsis]] after [[bowel perforation]], crushing, and accidental self-[[impalement]].

The subject has been treated in two books, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Autoerotic Fatalities&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by Hazelwood et al. (1983) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Autoerotic Asphyxiation: Forensic, Medical, and Social Aspects&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by Sheleg et al. (2006).
