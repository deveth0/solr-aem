&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;August Paul von Wassermann&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (21 February 1866 - 16 March 1925) was a [[Germany|German]] [[bacteriology|bacteriologist]] and [[hygienist]].

Born in [[Bamberg]], with Jewish origins, he studied at several universities throughout Germany, receiving his medical doctorate in 1888 from the [[University of Strassburg]]. In 1890 began work under [[Robert Koch]] at the Institute for Infectious Diseases in [[Berlin]]. In 1906 he became director of the division for experimental therapy and serum research at the institute, followed by a directorship of the department of experimental therapy at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft for the Advancement of Science in [[Berlin-Dahlem]] (1913).&amp;lt;ref name=WNI&amp;gt;[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2511.html August Paul von Wassermann] @ [[Who Named It]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Wassermann developed a [[complement fixation]] test for the diagnosis of [[syphilis]] in 1906, just one year after the causative organism, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Treponema pallidum|Spirochaeta pallida]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, had been identified by [[Fritz Schaudinn]] and [[Erich Hoffmann]].&amp;lt;ref name=WR&amp;gt;[http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/2962.html Wassermann&amp;apos;s reaction] @ [[Who Named It]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The so-called &amp;quot;[[Wassermann test]]&amp;quot; allowed for early detection of the disease (despite its [[nonspecific symptom]]s), and thus prevention of transmission. He attributed the development of the test to earlier findings of [[Jules Bordet]] and [[Octave Gengou]] (complement fixation reaction) and to a hypothesis introduced by [[Paul Ehrlich]] in his interpretation of [[antibody]] formation.&amp;lt;ref name=WNI/&amp;gt;

The [[Wassermann test]] remains a staple of syphilis detection and prevention in some areas, although it has often been replaced by more modern alternatives.&amp;lt;ref name=WR/&amp;gt; With [[Wilhelm Kolle]], he published the six-volume &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Handbuch der Pathogenen Mikroorganismen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Handbook of Pathogenic Microorganisms).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/089/000206468/ NNDB] (biography)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
