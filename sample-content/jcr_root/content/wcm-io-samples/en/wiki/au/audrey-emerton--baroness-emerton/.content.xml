Invested before as a Dame Commander, Order of the British Empire, she received a [[life peerage]] as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baroness Emerton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Tunbridge Wells in the County of [[Kent]] and of Clerkenwell in the [[London Borough of Islington]] on 17 February 1997.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p19123.htm |title= The Peerage |publisher=[http://www.thepeerage.com The Peerage]}}{{Verify credibility|failed=y |date=August 2012}}&amp;lt;!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy&amp;apos;s reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--&amp;gt;).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

She worked in the [[National Health Service]] as Chief Nursing Officer of South East Thames Regional Health Authority throughout the 1980s, and is chiefly remembered and honoured for leading the programme that replaced [[Darenth Park Hospital]], a huge [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] for people with [[learning disabilities]], which closed in August 1988.

She was Chancellor and Chief Commander of [[St John Ambulance]] and a volunteer with the organization for more than 50 years. She submitted her resignation in January 2002, saying she did not wish to seek a further three years in the post when her period of office expired in June 2002 &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://society.guardian.co.uk/charitymanagement/story/0,8150,707713,00.html &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Guardian&amp;apos;&amp;apos; charity management report]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
