&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Auckland Island&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the main island of the [[Auckland Islands]], an uninhabited [[archipelago]] in the south [[Pacific Ocean]] belonging to [[New Zealand]]. It is inscribed in the [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/877/multiple=1&amp;amp;unique_number=1029 UNESCO World Heritage list] together with the other [[subantarctic]] New Zealand islands in the region as follows: 877-004 Auckland Isls, New Zealand  S50.29 E165.52 62560Ha  1998

==Description==
The island has an approximate land area of {{convert|510|km2|sqmi}}, and is {{convert|42|km}} long. It is notable for its steep cliffs and rugged terrain, which rises to over {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. Prominent peaks include Cavern Peak ({{convert|650|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), Mount Raynal  ({{convert|635|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}),  [[Mount D&amp;apos;Urville]] ({{convert|630|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}),  Mount Easton ({{convert|610|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}),  and the Tower of Babel ({{convert|550|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

The southern end of the island broadens to a width of {{convert|26|km|abbr=on}}.  Here, a narrow channel known as [[Carnley Harbour]] (on some maps the Adams Straits) separates the main island from the smaller [[Adams Island, New Zealand|Adams Island]] . The channel is the remains of the crater of an extinct [[volcano]], Adams Island and the southern part of the main island form the crater rim. {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Carnley Harbour&amp;apos;s mouth lies [[Cape Lovitt]], the  [[Extreme points of New Zealand|westernmost point]] of New Zealand. {{clearleft}}

==Fauna==
The island is part of the Auckland Island group [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA), identified as such by [[BirdLife International]] because of the significance of the group as a breeding site for several species of [[seabird]]s as well as the endemic [[Auckland Shag]], [[Auckland Teal]], [[Auckland Rail]] and [[Auckland Snipe]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;BirdLife International. (2012). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Auckland Islands. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2012-01-23.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The island was home to a population of [[Auckland Island goats|feral goats]] from the 1800s until the 1990s. A campaign to remove them to the South Island begun in the 1980s was successful, and the remaining goats were eradicated.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web|title=Auckland Island Goats: A Rare Breed of New Zealand Origin|publisher=New Zealand Rare Breeds|url=http://www.rarebreeds.co.nz/auckgoats.html|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== In film==
The 1955 film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Sea Chase]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has a German merchant ship fleeing from British and Australian naval ships at the beginning of World War II.

The ship stops at Auckland Island (the film was shot at Hawaii) to take victuals from the rescue station. A pro-Nazi officer shoots the three castaway fishermen he finds there, following which time another ship locates the corpses and chases the German ship.

The plot is inspired on the trip of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] steamer [[Erlangen (ship)|Erlangen]].
