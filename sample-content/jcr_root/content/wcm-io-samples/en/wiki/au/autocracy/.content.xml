An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;autocracy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a system of government in which a supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor  regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of [[coup d&amp;apos;état]] or mass [[insurrection]]).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/autocracy |title=Autocracy: A Glossary of Political Economy Terms - Dr. Paul M. Johnson |publisher=Auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History and etymology==
This use remains current in the [[modern Greek]] language, where the term is used for anyone holding the title &amp;quot;emperor&amp;quot;, regardless of the actual power of the [[monarch]]. Some historical Slavic monarchs, such as [[List of Russian rulers|Russian tsars and emperors]], included the title &amp;quot;Autocrat&amp;quot; as part of their official styles, distinguishing them from the [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchs]] elsewhere in Europe.  {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Comparison with other forms of government==
Both [[totalitarianism]] and [[military dictatorship]] are often identified with, but need not be, an autocracy.  Totalitarianism is a system where the state strives to control every aspect of life and civil society. It can be headed by a supreme dictator, making it autocratic, but it can also have a [[collective leadership]] such as a commune or political party.

Because autocrats need a power structure to rule, it can be difficult to draw a clear line between historical autocracies and [[Oligarchy|oligarchies]]. Most historical autocrats depended on their [[Nobility|nobles]], the [[military]], the [[priest]]hood or other elite groups.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Tullock&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Tullock, Gordon. &amp;quot;Autocracy&amp;quot;, Springer Science * Business, 1987.
