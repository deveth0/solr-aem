&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Audio Video Standard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AVS&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a compression standard for [[digital audio]] and [[digital video]], and is competing with [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] and [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] to potentially replace [[MPEG-2]]. Chinese companies own 90% of AVS patents.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.avs.org.cn/en/index.asp AVS official web site]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The audio and video files have an .avs extension as a container format.

==Overview==
Development of AVS was initiated by the government of the People&amp;apos;s Republic of China. Commercial success of the AVS [[standardization|standard]] would not only reduce China&amp;apos;s royalty/licensing payments to foreign companies, it would presumably earn China&amp;apos;s electronics industry recognition among the more established industries of the developed world, where China is still seen as an outlet for mass production with limited indigenous design capability.

In January 2005, the AVS workgroup submitted their draft report to the [[Information Industry Department]] (IID). On March 30, 2005, the first trial by the IID approved the video portion of the draft standard for a public showing time.

The dominant audio/video compression standards, [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]] and [[Video Coding Experts Group|VCEG]], enjoy widespread use in consumer digital media devices, such as DVD players. Their usage requires Chinese manufacturers to pay substantial [[patent|royalty]] fees to the mostly-foreign companies that hold patents on technology in those standards. For example, as of 2006, licenses ranging from $2.50 to $4 already make up about ten percent of the cost for a contract-manufactured DVD player unit.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20020524S0091 Taiwan joins Chinese effort on proprietary DVD format]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

According to the state-run media, a key consideration of AVS was to reduce foreign dependence on core intellectual properties used in digital media technology. Proposed as a national standard in 2004, AVS had a targeted royalty of 1 RMB (or about $0.10 USD) per player. On April 30, 2005, AVS standard video officially passed the public show and became the national standard.

AVS was expected{{by whom|date=December 2011}} to be approved for the Chinese [[High-definition television|high-definition]] successor to the [[Enhanced Versatile Disc|EVD]], and when [[China Blue High-definition Disc|CBHD]] was released it shipped with 30GB blue laser discs and video in the AVS format, which rapidly gained market share â€“ standing at 30% of the video disc market after four months.

[[Open-source]] implementations of an AVS video decoder can be found in the [[OpenAVS]] project and within the [[libavcodec]] library. The latter is integrated in some free video players like [[MPlayer]], [[VLC media player|VLC]] or [[xine]]. [[xAVS]] is also an open source AVS encoder with a working decoder.

China&amp;apos;s high-definition video disc format [[China Blue High-definition Disc|CBHD]] (China blue high-definition) supports AVS.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Register_readies&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news |first=Austin |last=Modine |title=China readies Blu-Ray competitor |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/29/china_cbhd_ready/ |work=[[The Register]] |date=2008-07-29 |accessdate=2008-08-06 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
