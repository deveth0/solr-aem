&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;New Sparta State&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in Spanish &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Estado Nueva Esparta&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-es|esˈtaðo ˈnweβa esˈparta|IPA}}), is one of the 23 [[States of Venezuela|states]] of  [[Venezuela]]. It comprises [[Margarita Island]], [[Coche, Venezuela|Coche]], and the largely uninhabited [[Cubagua]].

The state is the smallest one in area, and is located off the northeast [[Caribbean]] coast of Venezuela. It is the only insular state of Venezuela. Its name comes from the heroism shown by its inhabitants during the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]], deemed similar to that of the [[Sparta]]n soldiers of [[Ancient Greece]]. The main island of Margarita alone has an area of 934&amp;amp;nbsp;km². In 1909 the state was constituted (then comprising Margarita and Coche Islands) and in 1947 the island of Cubagua was added. Its capital city is [[La Asunción]], but the main urban center is [[Porlamar]]. Other important towns are Juan Griego, [[Pampatar]] (home of the Port Authority), Punta de Piedras, San Juan Bautista, Las Guevaras, Las Hernández, Villa Rosa, Bella Vista (Margarita), El Valle del Espíritu Santo.

==History==
[[File:El Agua Beach (1).jpg|200px|thumb|Playa el Agua, [[Margarita Island]].]]

Founded in 1525, the [[Province of Margarita]] was the oldest of those that in 1777 formed the Post of Captain-General of [[Venezuela]]. It was dependent on the [[Royal Audience of Santo Domingo]] until 1739, when it was annexed to the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Virreinato de Nueva Granada&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

In 1821, when [[Gran Colombia]] was created, the Province of Margarita was integrated to the [[Orinoco Department]], along with other regions. When the Republic of Venezuela arose in 1830, it was one of the original [[Provinces of Venezuela]].

In 1864, when the country was divided into 20 states and a Federal District, Margarita took the name of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;State of New Sparta&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 1881 its status was changed to be a mere section of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Greater [[Guzman Blanco|Guzmán Blanco]] State&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Francisco de Miranda|Miranda]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from 1889 to 1898). In 1901, two years after the autonomy of the states was restored, it retook the name of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;New Sparta&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but again lost it between 1904 and 1909, period in which it was included in the Federal District as &amp;quot;Eastern Section&amp;quot;. Finally, in 1909 it recovered the condition of a State, and in 1948 it annexed the island of Cubagua.
