The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nueces River&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a river in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]], approximately {{convert|315|mi|km}} long.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{GNIS|1380949|Nueces River}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It drains a region in central and southern Texas southeastward into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. It is the southernmost major river in Texas northeast of the [[Rio Grande]].  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nueces&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is Spanish for [[nut (fruit)|nuts]];&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | title = Nuez- traductor Ingles-Español| publisher = SpanishDict.com | url = http://www.spanishdict.com/translate/nuez}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; early settlers named the river after the numerous pecan trees along its banks.

==Location and flow==
The Nueces rises northwest of [[San Antonio]] in the [[Edwards Plateau]], in [[Real County, Texas|Real County]] approximately 50&amp;amp;nbsp;mi (80&amp;amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Uvalde, Texas|Uvalde]]. It flows south through the [[Texas Hill Country]], past [[Barksdale, Texas|Barksdale]] and [[Crystal City, Texas|Crystal City]], approaching to within 35&amp;amp;nbsp;mi (56&amp;amp;nbsp;km) of the Rio Grande on the border with [[Mexico]]. East of [[Carrizo Springs, Texas|Carrizo Springs]] it turns to the east, flowing through the scrub plains of South Texas,  across rural [[Dimmit County, Texas|Dimmit]], [[La Salle County, Texas|La Salle]],and [[McMullen County, Texas|McMullen]] counties. In La Salle county the river hardly ever flows except for when it rains. In central [[Live Oak County, Texas|Live Oak County]] it is joined from the northwest by the [[Frio River]], then flows southeast along the [[coastal plain]] past [[Mathis, Texas|Mathis]], where it is impounded to form the [[Lake Corpus Christi]] reservoir. It enters [[Corpus Christi Bay]] on the Gulf of Mexico at [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]].

==History==
One of the first settlers to scout the area was Cpt. [[Blas María de la Garza Falcón]] in 1766.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;THB&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fga66|title=Clotilde P. García|publisher=The Texas State Historical Association|date=|accessdate=2007-06-24}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; From before the end of the [[Texas Revolution]], [[Mexico]] recognized that the Nueces River was historically the border of [[Coahuila y Tejas|Texas]] from the rest of the country.  However, the [[Republic of Texas]] claimed the [[Rio Grande]] as its border with Mexico, citing the [[Treaty of Velasco]] signed by Mexican President Santa Anna, who agreed to the Rio Grande border after losing the Battle of San Jacinto.  This dispute continued after the [[Texas Annexation|annexation of Texas]], and was one of the causes of the [[Mexican-American War]].  The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] ended the dispute, with Mexico recognizing under pressure the Rio Grande as its northern border.

On August 10, 1862 pro-Union Germans from the [[Texas Hill Country]] trying to flee to Mexico were ambushed and killed by Confederates&amp;amp;mdash;the [[Nueces massacre]].

==Fishing==
The Nueces is one of several clear warm-water spring creeks in the Hill Country of Texas.  In its upper reaches, the water is clear and cool.

Unlike spring trout creeks in the Rocky Mountains, the Nueces holds [[largemouth bass]], [[smallmouth bass]], and the native [[guadalupe bass]], along with a variety of panfish such as [[redbreast sunfish]], [[rock bass]], [[green sunfish]] and [[Texas cichlid|Rio Grande perch]]. The [[American Alligator]] are also abundant in the Nueces River.
