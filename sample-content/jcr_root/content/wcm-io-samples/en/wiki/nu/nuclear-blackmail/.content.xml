        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nuclear [[blackmail]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a form of [[nuclear strategy]] in which an aggressor uses the [[Threat of force (public international law)|threat]] of use of [[nuclear weapon]]s to force an adversary to perform some action or make some concessions. It is a type of [[extortion]], related to [[brinkmanship]].

==Effectiveness==

Nuclear blackmail is considered most effective when the person making the threat is unhinged and ostensibly willing to commit [[suicide]].  (See [[game theory]]). The prevention of these threats by irrational actors is the stated purpose behind the [[National Missile Defense]] program undertaken by President [[George W. Bush]] of the United States.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

It is generally regarded as ineffective against a rational opponent who has or is an ally of someone who has [[assured destruction]] capability. If both states have [[nuclear weapon]]s, the form of nuclear blackmail becomes a threat of [[Conflict escalation|escalation]]. In this situation if the opponent refuses to respond, then one&amp;apos;s choices are either surrender or suicide. During the [[Cold War]], the explicit threat of [[nuclear warfare]] to force an opponent to perform an action was rare in that most nations were allies of either the [[Soviet Union]] or the [[United States]].

==History==

In 1953, Eisenhower threatened the use of Nuclear Weapons to end the Korean War if the Chinese refused to negotiate. Consequently the Chinese and North Korea signed the Armistice. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0ihCymqlPw}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The United States issued several nuclear threats against the [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China]] in the 1950s to force the evacuation of outlying islands and the cessation of attacks against [[Quemoy]] and [[Matsu (islands)|Matsu]], part of [[Republic of China]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; Edward Friedman, “Nuclear Blackmail and the end of the Korean War,” &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Modern China&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1 1 (Jan. 1975), 75-91. &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Recently declassified documents from the [[National Archives (UK)]] indicate that the [[United Kingdom]] considered threatening [[China]] with nuclear retaliation in 1961 in the case of a military reclamation of [[Hong Kong]] by China.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;BBC news&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news | title= UK pondered China nuclear attack |date=2006-06-30|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5130524.stm}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The unwillingness of the [[Soviet Union]] to respond to these threats on China&amp;apos;s behalf was one of the major factors in the Chinese decision to develop an independent nuclear arsenal.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

It has been claimed that [[Margaret Thatcher]] threatened nuclear retaliation against [[Argentina]] during the 1982 [[Falklands War]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news | title= Thatcher &amp;apos;threatened to nuke Argentina&amp;apos; |date=2005-11-22|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/nov/22/books.france}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==In fiction==

Nuclear blackmail, typically by a [[supervillain]] rather than a state, has been frequently employed as a [[plot device]] in [[spy fiction]] and [[action film]]s. Since such a scheme appeared in the film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the [[trope (literature)|trope]] has been particularly associated with the [[James Bond]] series and in [[24 (TV series)]]. The notion of a supervillain threatening world leaders with a nuclear device has since become a cliché, and has been [[parody|parodied]] in Charles K. Feldman&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Simpsons]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; episode &amp;quot;[[You Only Move Twice]]&amp;quot;, and other espionage spoofs.
