A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;nue&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (鵺) is a [[legendary creature]] found in [[Japanese folklore]]. It is described as having the head of a [[monkey]], the body of a [[raccoon dog]], the legs of a [[tiger]], and a [[snake]] as a tail. According to the legend, a nue can [[metamorphose]] into a black cloud and fly. Due to its appearance, it is sometimes referred to as a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Japanese [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Cavallaro, Dani.

According to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Tale of the Heike]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Emperor Konoe, the [[Emperor of Japan]], became ill after having terrible nightmares every night, and a dark cloud appeared at two o&amp;apos;clock in the morning on the roof of the palace in Kyoto during the summer of 1153. The story says that the [[samurai]] [[Minamoto no Yorimasa]] staked-out the roof one night and fired an arrow into the cloud, out of which fell a dead nue. Yorimasa then supposedly sank the body in the Sea of Japan. In a local expansion of the story, the nue&amp;apos;s corpse floated into a certain bay, and the locals, fearing a curse, buried it. A mound near the bay which exists today is supposed to be the grave created for this nue.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.obakemono.com/obake/nue/ Nue; The Obakemono project], www.obakemono.com, 20 August 2006, (accessed 21 January 2007)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Etymology==

The word, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nue&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, appears in the oldest of Japanese literature. Early quotes include [[Kojiki]] (712) and [[Wamyō Ruijushō]] (c. 934). Due to the use of [[Man&amp;apos;yōgana]], the [[Jōdai Tokushu Kanazukai|historical spelling]] is known to have been &amp;apos;&amp;apos;nuye&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. At this early time, although, it had a different semantic meaning. It referred to a bird known as [[White&amp;apos;s Thrush]].

In the thirteenth century, [[Heike Monogatari]] makes reference to a creature called a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;nue&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In addition to having the head of a monkey, the body of a [[tanuki]], the paws of a tiger, and a snake as a tail, it has the voice of a [[White&amp;apos;s Thrush]].

Around 1435, [[Zeami Motokiyo]] wrote a [[Noh]] song titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nue&amp;apos;&amp;apos; dealing with the events described in Heike.
