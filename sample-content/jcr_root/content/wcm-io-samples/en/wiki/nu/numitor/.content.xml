In [[Roman mythology]], King &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Numitor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of [[Alba Longa]], son of [[Procas]], descendant of [[Aeneas]] the [[Troy|Trojan]], was the father of [[Rhea Silvia]]. He was overthrown by his brother, [[Amulius]], and thrown out of his kingdom where he had ruled. Amulius also murdered his sons, in an effort to remove power from his brother for himself. His grandsons, however, [[Romulus and Remus]], reinstated him after killing Amulius.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Livy]] I.3.10-I.6.2; [[Virgil]] VI, 768.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
