The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;National War and Resistance Museum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the [[Netherlands]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dutch language|Dutch]]: Nationaal Oorlogs- en Verzetsmuseum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is located at [[Overloon]], municipality [[Boxmeer]].

The museum is located on the site of the [[Battle of Overloon]], a [[World War II]] tank and infantry battle between [[Allied]] and [[Germany|German]] forces that occurred in September and October 1944, in the aftermath of [[Operation Market Garden]].

Set in 14 hectares of woodland, it is one of two museums in an area now designated as Liberty Park.  A feature of the museum is the large number of military vehicles and equipment on display, both German and Allied.  For years these have been kept in the open air, but have recently been moved indoors in order to help preserve them. Many of the exhibited vehicles took part in the Battle of Overloon. In 2006 the collection was expanded with a large number of vehicles from a private collection.
