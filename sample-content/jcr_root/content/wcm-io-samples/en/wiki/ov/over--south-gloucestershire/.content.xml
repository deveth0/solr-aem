&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Over&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] in the [[civil parish]] of [[Almondsbury]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://almondsburyparishcouncil.co.uk/ Almondsbury Parish Council website]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; in [[South Gloucestershire]], [[England]],  situated about 20&amp;amp;nbsp;km north-west of [[Bristol]].  It lies on the [[B4055 road|B4055]], a road that parallels the [[M5 motorway|M5]] from Junction 17 to 16. The road, known locally as Over Lane, follows the foot of the escarpment which overlooks the [[Severn]] floodplain, whereas the motorway follows the ridge. According to local [[legend]]s, a [[ghost]] of an old woman haunts this town every [[New Year]]&amp;apos;s Eve.

Nearby the main [[London]] to [[South Wales]] railway line emerges from [[Patchway]] Tunnel, passes the [[Cattybrook Brickpit|Cattybrook Brickwork]]s, before heading across the Severn floodplain to the [[Severn Tunnel]].
