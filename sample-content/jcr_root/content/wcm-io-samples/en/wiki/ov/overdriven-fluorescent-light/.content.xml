Overdriving a [[fluorescent lamp]] is a method of getting more light from each tube than is obtained under rated conditions.
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ODNO&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Overdriven Normal Output) fluorescent tubes are generally used when there isn&amp;apos;t enough room to put in more bulbs to increase the light.  The method is effective, but generates some additional issues. This technique has become popular among aquatic gardeners as a cost effective way to add more light to their aquariums.  While power compact fluorescent lights cost upwards of $60â€“100 in the US, a twin bulb overdriven lamp can be set up for $30.

Overdriving is done by rewiring lamp fixtures to increase lamp current; however, lamp life is reduced, and modifications of factory lamp wiring void all safety approvals such as [[Underwriters&amp;apos; Laboratories|UL]] or [[Canadian Standards Association|CSA]].
