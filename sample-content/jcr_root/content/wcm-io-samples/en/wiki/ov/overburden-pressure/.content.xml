        text="&lt;p&gt;{{Unreferenced|date=May 2009}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Overburden pressure&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;lithostatic pressure&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;confining pressure&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;vertical stress&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is the [[pressure]] or [[stress (physics)|stress]] imposed on a layer of [[soil]] or [[Rock (geology)|rock]] by the weight of overlying material.

The overburden pressure at a depth z is given by

:&amp;lt;math&amp;gt;p(z) = p_0 + g \int_{0}^{z} \rho(z)  \, dz&amp;lt;/math&amp;gt;

where &amp;amp;rho;(z) is the [[density]] of the overlying rock at depth z and g is the [[Standard gravity|acceleration due to gravity]].  p&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; is the [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] pressure, like the pressure at the surface.

It may be noted that the above equation implies that gravitational acceleration is a constant over z since it is placed outside of the integral.  Strictly speaking, for almost all boundary conditions, g should appear inside the integrand since g is a function of the distance from mass.  However, since g varies little over depths which are a very small fraction of the Earth&amp;apos;s radius, it is placed outside of the integral in practice for most near-surface applications which require an assessment of lithostatic pressure.  In deep-earth geophysics/geodynamics, gravitational acceleration varies significantly over depth, demanding that g be taken, at least, as a function of depth.
