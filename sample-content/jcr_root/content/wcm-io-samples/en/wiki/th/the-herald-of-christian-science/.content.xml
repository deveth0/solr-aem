&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Herald of Christian Science&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was first published in 1903 in response to the demand for a monthly publication on [[Christian Science]] in [[Germany]].  Due to an increasing demand for Christian Science Literature from other countries, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herald&amp;apos;&amp;apos; grew to include twelve different languages.  Until the 90â€™s the magazine was [[bilingual]], with [[English language|English]] and translated texts side by side.  Currently the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herald&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is available in fourteen languages, giving readers around the world an understanding of Christian Science practice.  Along with articles and accounts of [[Faith healing|healing]], each issue includes a directory of Christian Science churches, practitioners and other listings applicable to each language. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Herald&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is also produced as a [[radio]] program in five languages.
