Born in [[Pisa]], [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], the son of the physician [[William Hamilton (physician)|William Hamilton]] (1758-90) and Elizabeth Stirling, he was the grandson of the anatomist and botanist [[Thomas Hamilton (anatomist)|Professor Thomas Hamilton]] (died 1782), the nephew of the politician [[Charles Francis Greville]], and the younger brother of the philosopher, [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]].

He was educated at [[university of Glasgow|Glasgow University]], where he made a close friend of [[Michael Scott (novelist)|Michael Scott]], the author of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tom Cringle&amp;apos;s Log&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He entered the army in 1810, and served throughout the [[Peninsular War|Peninsular]] (he was wounded at [[Battle of Albuera|Albuera]] in 1811) and American campaigns, but continued to cultivate his literary tastes. On the conclusion of peace he withdrew, with the rank of captain, from active service.

He contributed both prose and verse to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Blackwood&amp;apos;s Magazine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in which appeared his vigorous and popular military novel, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cyril Thornton&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1827). His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Annals of the Peninsular Campaign&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, published originally in 1829, and republished in 1849 with additions by Frederick Hardman, is written with great clearness and impartiality. His only other work, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Men and Manners in America&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, published originally in 1833, is somewhat coloured by British prejudice, and by the author&amp;apos;s aristocratic dislike of a [[democracy]]. Hamilton died at [[Pisa]] on 7 December 1842.
