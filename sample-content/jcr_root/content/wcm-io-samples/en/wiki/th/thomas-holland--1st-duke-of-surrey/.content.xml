&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey, 3rd Earl of Kent, 4th Baron Holland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Order of the Garter|KG]], [[Earl Marshal]] (1374 &amp;amp;ndash; 7 January 1400) was an [[England|English]] nobleman.

==Early life and family==

He was the son of the [[Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent|2nd Earl of Kent]] and [[Alice Holland, Countess of Kent|Lady Alice FitzAlan]]. His maternal grandparents were the [[Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel|10th Earl of Arundel]] and [[Eleanor of Lancaster|Lady Eleanor of Lancaster]]. He was also a nephew of [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]], and a [[Knight of the Garter]].

On his father&amp;apos;s death in 1397 he succeeded him as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;3rd Earl of Kent&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;4th Baron Holand&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. At that time Kent&amp;apos;s uncle King Richard II was removing the [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]] and his associates from power, and sent Kent to arrest his own uncle, the Earl of Arundel. In reward he received a share of the forfeited estates, and on 29 September 1397 was created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Duke of Surrey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Another uncle, the [[John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter|Earl of Huntingdon]], was created Duke of Exeter on that day as well.

==Last years and execution==

Surrey, along with many of King Richard II&amp;apos;s advisors, was arrested after the King&amp;apos;s deposition by [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV of England]] in 1399. In the end he had to forfeit the honours and estates he had gained after the arrests of Gloucester and Arundel, in particular the Dukedom of Surrey, although he retained the Earldom of Kent.

Early in 1400, Kent, along with his uncle, the Earl of Huntingdon (no longer Duke of Exeter), plotted to kill King Henry IV and free King Richard II from prison and return him to the throne. This &amp;quot;[[Epiphany Rising]]&amp;quot; failed and Kent was captured and executed.

He left no children by his wife, the former Lady Joan Stafford, daughter of the [[Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford|2nd Earl of Stafford]]. He was succeeded as Earl of Kent by his brother Edmund.
