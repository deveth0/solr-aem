It tells the story of two musicians, played in their old age by [[Serge Reggiani]] and [[Laurent Terzieff]] and in their youth by [[Pere Ponce]] and [[Jordi Mollà]], who were friends at the onset of the [[Spanish Civil War]].  They meet 60 years later, and we are presented with the strikingly different paths which they took in the circumstances of the war.
