&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Jersey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[television series]] that aired on [[Disney Channel]] that premiered January 30, 1999, and based on the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Monday Night Football Club]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; books by [[Gordon Korman]].

The show has several sports superstars as guest [[actor]]s, including [[Dan Lyle]], [[Michael Andretti]], [[Terrell Davis]], [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]], [[Malik Rose]], [[Tony Gonzalez (tight end)|Tony Gonzalez]], [[Shannon Sharpe]], [[Donovan McNabb]], [[Byron Dafoe]], [[Michael Strahan]], [[Kurt Warner]], [[Stephon Marbury]], [[Sergei Fedorov]], [[Kordell Stewart]], [[Jerome Bettis]], [[Junior Seau]], [[Scott Steiner]], [[Eddie George]], [[Sabrina Bryan]], [[Randy Johnson]], [[Tony Hawk]], [[Laila Ali]], [[Peyton Manning]], and [[Danny Farmer]].
