&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rejs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, known in English as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Cruise&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Trip Down the River&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[comedy]] film released in 1970, directed by [[Marek Piwowski]] who also co-wrote the [[screenplay]] with [[Janusz Głowacki]]. The score was composed by [[Wojciech Kilar]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rejs&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is considered as a masterpiece by many and as the earliest [[cult film]] in [[Cinema of Poland|Polish cinema]]. Shot in a quasi-documentary style, with a cast featuring not more than two or three professional actors, the absurd plot parodies life in the [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of Poland]], reducing a weekend river cruise to a hilarious parody of the entire [[communist]] system.

A stowaway ([[Stanisław Tym]]) sneaks aboard a ship departing on a cruise down the [[Vistula]] River. The captain takes him for a [[Communist Party]] cultural coordinator and the intruder gladly adapts to his new role, immediately setting to work at manipulating the passengers and crew into silly and vaguely humiliating games. Before long, Tym has got everyone under his thumb and created his own comedic dictatorship. A memorable performance was given by [[Jan Himilsbach]], an amateur actor who formerly carved tombstones.
