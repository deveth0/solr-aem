&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Docks of New York&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  ([[1928 in film|1928]]) is a [[silent film|silent drama film]] directed by [[Josef von Sternberg]] and starring [[George Bancroft (actor)|George Bancroft]], [[Betty Compson]], and [[Olga Baclanova]]. The movie was adapted by [[Jules Furthman]] from the [[John Monk Saunders]] story &amp;quot;The Dock Walloper&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/D/DocksOfNewYork1928.html &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Docks of New York&amp;apos;&amp;apos; at silentera.com]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Plot==
The story involves an incredibly strong ship [[stoker (occupation)|stoker]] name Bill (Bancroft) and the beautiful [[prostitute]] named Mae (Compson), whom he saves from drowning. She was attempting suicide as she had no money, almost no clothes and felt remorse about her life up to then. He steals some clothes for her and invites her out for a &amp;quot;good night&amp;quot;. They go to a bustling wharf pub and that evening they  spontaneously get married by a minister invited to the pub.

The next morning Bill must go back to sea. Mae is disappointed, as he says he was &amp;quot;just having a good time&amp;quot;.  He also says he couldn&amp;apos;t be serious about staying with her and fulfilling his marriage vows because his job keeps him at sea.

Before Bill&amp;apos;s ship leaves the city harbor, events help him to decide...he must not leave her.  He goes to the tavern and asks &amp;quot;Where is my Wife?&amp;quot;.  One patron directs him to the local Night Court. She had been accused of stealing the clothes that he had actually stolen for her. The judge sentences her to 30 days in jail. But Bill speaks up and says that he had stolen the clothes. The irritated judge gives him 60 days for theft. Bill says he would do the time for her; she pledges to wait for him...
