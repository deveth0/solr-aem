&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Lost Road and Other Writings&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the fifth volume of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The History of Middle-earth]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a series of compilations of drafts and essays written by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. It was edited and published posthumously in 1987 by [[Christopher Tolkien]].

It contains the following pieces:

# &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Early History of the Legend&amp;apos;&amp;apos; — an introduction to the following two pieces, detailing how Tolkien&amp;apos;s correspondence with [[C. S. Lewis]] led to the writing of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Lost Road&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
# &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Fall of Númenor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; — an early draft of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Akallabêth]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
# &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Lost Road&amp;apos;&amp;apos; — a story that connects Tolkien&amp;apos;s other tales to the present
# The later &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Annals of [[Beleriand]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
# The later &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Annals of [[Valinor]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
# The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ainulindalë&amp;apos;&amp;apos; — an early version of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ainulindalë|The Music of the Ainur]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
# &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The [[Lhammas]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Account of Tongues&amp;quot;) — an overview of the various languages of [[Middle-earth]]
# &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quenta Silmarillion&amp;apos;&amp;apos; — a draft of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Quenta Silmarillion|The Silmarillion]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
# The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Etymologies (Tolkien)|Etymologies]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; — an etymological dictionary of the Elvish tongues
# The second Silmarillion map

The title pages of each volume of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;History of Middle-earth&amp;apos;&amp;apos; have an inscription in [[Tengwar]], written by Christopher Tolkien and describing the contents of the book. The inscription in Book V reads: &amp;quot;Herein are collected the oldest Tale of the Downfall of [[Númenor]], the story of the Lost Road into the West, the [[Annals of Valinor]] and the [[Annals of Beleriand]] in a later form, the [[Ainulindalë]], or the [[Music of the Ainur]], the Lhammas, or Account of tongues, the [[Quenta Silmarillion]] or History of the [[Silmarils]] and the history of many words and names.&amp;quot;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Lost Road&amp;apos;&amp;apos; itself is a fragmentary beginning of a tale, including a rough structure and several intriguing chunks of narrative, including four entire chapters dealing with modern England and Númenor, from which the entire story as it should have been can be glimpsed. The scheme was of time-travel by means of &amp;apos;vision&amp;apos; or being mentally inserted into what had been, so as to actually re-experience that which had happened. In this way the tale links first to [[England in the Middle Ages|Saxon England]] of [[Alfred the Great]], then to the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[Alboin]] of [[Benedict of Nursia|St. Benedict]]&amp;apos;s time, the [[Baltic Sea]] in [[Viking Age|Old Norse days]], Ireland at the time of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann|Tuatha Dé]]&amp;apos;s coming (600 years after [[Deluge myth|the Flood]]), prehistoric North in the [[Ice Age]], a &amp;apos;Galdor story&amp;apos; of  [[Third Age]] Middle-earth, and finally the Fall of [[Gil-galad]], before recounting the prime legend of the Downfall of Númenor/[[Atlantis]] and the Bending of the World. It explores the theme of a &amp;apos;straight road&amp;apos; into the West, now only in memory because the world is round.
