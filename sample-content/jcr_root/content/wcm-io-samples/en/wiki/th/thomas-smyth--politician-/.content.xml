He was also Colonel of the Limerick Militia.  He was succeeded in the constituency and in militia by his brother [[John Prendergast Smyth, 1st Viscount Gort|John Prendergast Smyth]]. John had also inherited the estates of their uncle, [[Sir Thomas Prendergast, 2nd Baronet]], even though Thomas was the oldest son. John was later ennobled as the first [[Viscount Gort]].

==Family==
He was the eldest son of [[Charles Smyth (politician)|Charles Smyth]], Member of Parliament for Limerick City, and Elizabeth Prendergast (born 1708). His paternal grandparents were the Rt. Rev. [[Thomas Smyth (bishop)|Thomas Smyth]] (1650–1725), [[Bishop of Limerick]], and Dorothea Burgh (daughter of the Rt. Reverend [[Ulysses Burgh]], [[Bishop of Ardagh]]) and his paternal uncle was the Most Reverend Arthur Smyth (1707–1772), [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Dublin]]. His maternal grandparents were Brig.
