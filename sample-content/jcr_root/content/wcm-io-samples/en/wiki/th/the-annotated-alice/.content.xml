        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Annotated Alice&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a work by [[Martin Gardner]] incorporating the text of [[Lewis Carroll]]&amp;apos;s major tales: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Alice&amp;apos;s Adventures in Wonderland]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Through the Looking-Glass]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as well as the original illustrations by [[John Tenniel]]. It has extensive annotations explaining the contemporary references (including the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] poems that Carroll parodies), mathematical concepts, [[word play]], and Victorian traditions (such as the [[snap-dragon (game)|snap-dragon]]s) featured in the two books.

The original book was first published in 1960. It has been reprinted several times and translated into Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, German and Hebrew.

In 1990, a sequel, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;More Annotated Alice&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was published. This sequel doesn&amp;apos;t contain the original side notes and Tenniel&amp;apos;s illustrations were replaced by those of [[Peter Newell]]. It also contains the &amp;quot;suppressed&amp;quot; chapter &amp;quot;The Wasp in a Wig&amp;quot;, which Carroll omitted from the text of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Through the Looking-Glass&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on Tenniel&amp;apos;s recommendation.

In 1999 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Definitive Edition&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was published. It combines the notes from both works and features Tenniel&amp;apos;s illustrations in improved quality.

Gardner also compiled a companion volume, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Annotated Snark]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, dedicated to Carroll&amp;apos;s classic nonsense poem &amp;quot;[[The Hunting of the Snark]]&amp;quot;.
