&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Man Who Awoke&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[science fiction]] [[novel]] by [[Laurence Manning]].  It was initially serialised in five parts during 1933 in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wonder Stories]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[magazine]]. Later it was published as one complete novel in 1975 by Del Rey/Ballantine.

Norman Winters puts himself into [[suspended animation]] for 5,000 years at a time. The stories detail his ensuing adventures as he tries to make sense of the societies he encounters each time he wakes.

==Plot summary==
* 5000 AD. Humanity staggers to save itself amid the world&amp;apos;s littered, stagnant wreckage after what has become known as the great &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Age of Waste&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
* 10,000 AD. The world is dominated by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the Brain&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - the immovable in purpose [[super computer]] that knows all, sees all, and feels nothing.  Thanks to its cradle-to-grave supervision, human life is easy and comfortable, but what will happen when The Brain realizes people are superfluous?
* 15,000 AD. People can now program their choice of dreams and [[sleep]] their lives away.  Winters awakes to find the sleeping outnumber the living.  He cannot stop the implosion of civilization by himself.
* 20,000 AD. After an abused Age of Freedom came an Age of License.  Genetic experiment heralded the terrifying &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Age of Anarchy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  Each Individual had his own mobile &amp;quot;City&amp;quot; that provided for all his needs, resulting in a society where people had no need for each other and were incapable of cooperating, resulting in nearly all interpersonal encounters being small wars.
* 25,000 AD. Scientists discover the secret sought through the centuries â€“ [[immortality]].  But is Mankind ready for it?  Immortality is frightfully boring without a purpose.  Humanity scatters to the far corners of the cosmos seeking knowledge and experience, leading to a quest toward &amp;quot;the meaning of it all.&amp;quot;

The novel might be easily dismissed as standard pulp fare if it had not presaged concepts popularized decades later:  the [[sexual revolution]], green consumerism, [[strong AI]], full-immersion [[virtual reality]] as a surgical procedure (like [[The Matrix]]), desktop [[molecular manufacturing]], [[global warming]], and [[stem cell]] therapies.  Many of these have only appeared in most peoples&amp;apos; worldview in the 21st century.  This book was recently re-released.
