        text="&lt;p&gt;:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;For the Ancient Greek woman artist see [[Timarete]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

In [[Greek mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thamyris&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-el|Θάμυρις}}), son of [[Philammon]] and the nymph [[Telephassa|Argiope]], was a [[Thrace|Thracian]] singer who was so proud of his skill that he boasted he could outsing the [[Muses]]. He competed against them and lost. As punishment for his presumption they blinded him, and took away his ability to make poetry and to play the lyre. This outline of the story is told in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Iliad]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Iliad&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 2.594-600.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

This allusion         is taken up in [[Euripides]]&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rhesus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Library]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; attributed to Apollodorus, and in the [[Scholia]] on the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Iliad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. These later sources add the details that Thamyris had claimed as his prize, if he should win the contest, the privilege of having sex with all the Muses (according to one version) or of marrying one of them (according to another); and that after his death he was further punished in [[Hades]]. The story legendarily demonstrates that poetic inspiration, a gift of the gods, can be taken away by the gods.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Apollodorus, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Library]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1.3.3; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Scholia on the Iliad&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 2.595. See {{Citation | surname=Dalby | given=Andrew | authorlink=Andrew Dalby | title=[[Rediscovering Homer]] | publisher=Norton | place=New York, London | year=2006 | ISBN=0-393-05788-7 }}, p. 96.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

According to [[Diodorus]] the mythical singer [[Linus (mythology)|Linus]] took three pupils: [[Heracles]], Thamyris, and [[Orpheus]], which neatly settles Thamyris&amp;apos;s legendary chronology.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], 3.67.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; When [[Pliny the Elder]] briefly sketches the origins of music he credits Thamyris with inventing the [[Dorian mode]] and with being the first to play the [[cithara]] as a solo instrument with no voice accompaniment.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Pliny. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Natural History&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 7.207.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

A lost epic attributed to Thamyris, [[Titanomachy (epic poem)|Titanomachy]], was mentioned in passing in the essay &amp;quot;On Music&amp;quot; that was once believed to be authored by [[Plutarch]].

Thamyris is said to have been a lover of [[Hyacinthus]] and thus to have been the first man to have loved another male.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Apollodorus. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Library&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1.3.3.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thamyris&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is another name for the ancient Greek painter [[Timarete]] and also the name of a [[Thebes (Greece)|Theban]] who was killed by [[Actor (mythology)|Actor]].

[[Thamyris Glacier]] on [[Anvers Island]] in [[Antarctica]] is named after Thamyris.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=136904 Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica:] Thamyris Glacier.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
