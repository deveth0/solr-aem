        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thérèse Oulton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1953) is an [[England|English]] [[Painting|painter]].

Born in [[Shropshire]], Oulton studied in the late 1970s at [[St Martin&amp;apos;s School of Art]] before going on to the [[Royal College of Art]].

Oulton&amp;apos;s work is essentially [[abstract art|abstract]] though her early work often resembles rocky landscapes. Later works, often executed in a thick [[impasto]], are abstract compositions with complicated and carefully worked surfaces.

A number of Oulton&amp;apos;s later works use multiple repeated images, often with slight variations between the repetitions.

In 1987, Oulton was nominated for the [[Turner Prize]]. She is represented by the [[Marlborough Gallery]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.marlboroughfineart.com/artist-Therese-Oulton-34.html Marlborough Fine Art]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Her work is included in several public collections including [[Dallas Museum of Art]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[Tate Gallery]], UK [[Government Art Collection]] and the [[British Council Art Collection]].
