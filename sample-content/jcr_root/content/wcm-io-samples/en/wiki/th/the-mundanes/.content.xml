        text="&lt;p&gt;{{refimprove|date=September 2012}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Mundanes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were an early-1980s [[Rhode Island]]-based [[New Wave music|New Wave]] band with six members: John Andrews, Marsha Armitage, Jonathan Gregg, Dean Lozow, and Kevin Tooley, and [[John Linnell]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;mits&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Make It the Same&amp;apos;&amp;apos; single liner notes.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Marsha Armitage was the lead vocalist.  The band was  initially based in Providence (several of the band members attended Brown University) and played locally in the Boston-Providence area.  The band generated tremendous energy and had a devoted following, but struggled to sign to a record label.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://digboston.com/listen/2011/07/exclusive-john-flansburgh/ DigBoston Interview] with [[John Flansburgh]], 26 July 2011.

Shortly thereafter, [[John Linnell]] left the band to pursue another musical project, [[They Might Be Giants]], with [[John Flansburgh]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://observermedia.designobserver.com/audio/john-flansburgh/32458/ Interview] with [[John Flansburgh]] on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Design Matters&amp;apos;&amp;apos; podcast, 3 March 2012.

The band continued to gig in New England and played frequently in New York City venues, including CBGB.   [[David Hemmings]], who had previously managed [[Pat Travers]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]], took on the band&amp;apos;s management.  They recorded a demo at RCA Studios, produced by [[Mick Ronson]], that attracted record label attention, but the band remained unsigned and ultimately broke up in mid-1983.
