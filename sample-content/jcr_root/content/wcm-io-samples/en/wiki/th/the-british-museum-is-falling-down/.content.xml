&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The British Museum Is Falling Down&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[1965 in literature|1965]]) is a [[comic novel]] by British author [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] about a 25-year-old poverty-stricken student of [[English literature]] who, rather than work on his [[thesis]] (entitled &amp;quot;The Structure of Long Sentences in Three Modern English Novels&amp;quot;) in the [[British Museum Reading Room|reading room]] of the [[British Museum]], is time and again distracted from his work and who gets into all kinds of trouble instead.

==Summary==
Set in [[Swinging London]], the novel describes one day in the life of Adam Appleby, who lives in constant fear that his wife might be [[pregnancy|pregnant]] again with a fourth child. As [[Catholicism|Catholics]], they are denied any form of [[contraception]] and have to play &amp;quot;[[Natural family planning|Vatican roulette]]&amp;quot; instead. Adam and Barbara have three children: Clare, Dominic, and Edward; their friends ask if they &amp;apos;&amp;apos;intend working through the whole alphabet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In the course of only one busy day, several chances to make some money present themselves to Adam. For example, he is offered the opportunity to edit a deceased scholar&amp;apos;s unpublished [[manuscript]]s; however, when he eventually has a look at them, he feels uncomfortable realizing that the man&amp;apos;s writings are worthless drivel. Also, at the house in [[Bayswater, London|Bayswater]] where he is supposed to get the papers, Adam has to cope with an assortment of weird characters ranging from [[butcher]]s to a young [[virgin]] intent on seducing him.

Lodge&amp;apos;s novel makes extensive use of [[pastiche]], incorporating passages where both the motifs and the styles of writing used by various authors are imitated.  For instance, there is a [[Franz Kafka|Kafkaesque]] scene where Adam has to renew his reading-room ticket. The final chapter of the novel is a [[monologue]] by Adam&amp;apos;s wife in the style of [[Molly Bloom&amp;apos;s soliloquy]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

This use of different styles mirrors [[James Joyce]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ulysses&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a work also about a single day. When Lodge&amp;apos;s novel first came out, quite a number of reviewers and critics, not appreciating the literary allusions, found fault with Lodge for his inhomogeneous writing.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;David Lodge: &amp;quot;Afterword&amp;quot; (1980). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The British Museum Is Falling Down&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Penguin Books]], 1983), p.171.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
