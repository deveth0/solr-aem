Thrapston is close to the [[River Nene]] and is at the junction of the [[A14 (Britain)|A14]] and the [[A45 road|A45]]. Until the 1960s, Thrapston had two railway stations. Thrapston (Midland) was on the [[Kettering]] to [[Cambridge]] route, and the former station and viaduct can be seen from the adjacent A14 road. Thrapston (Bridge Street) was on the former [[London and North Western Railway|LNWR]] [[Northampton]] to [[Peterborough]] line.

The market charter was granted over 800 years ago, in the year 1205, in exchange for two [[palfrey]]s. This is celebrated every year with the town&amp;apos;s [[Charter fair]], where the high street is closed and the people in the town get together to commemorate this event. A relative of [[George Washington]], Sir John Washington, lived in Chancery Lane in the town, and his wife is buried in the church. Sir John was brother to George Washington&amp;apos;s great-grandfather.  Naturalist and writer [[Horace William Wheelwright]] practiced as an attorney in Thrapston in the 1840s. Fashion photographer [[James Kenny (photographer)|James Kenny]] currently lives in the town.

Thrapston has two schools, Thrapston [[primary education|Primary]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.thrapston-primary.northants.sch.uk/ Thrapston Primary School]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and King John middle school,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.kingjohn.northants.sch.uk/ King John Middle School]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; which together serve children from four to thirteen. Thrapston Primary is for children aged 4 to 9 and King John is for ages 9 to 13, following which children go to schools elsewhere, usually [[Prince William School]] in [[Oundle]].

The town&amp;apos;s football club, [[Thrapston Town F.C.|Thrapston Town]], plays in the [[United Counties Football League|United Counties League]].
