&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thumbcuffs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are a metal [[physical restraint|restraining]] device that lock [[thumb]]s in proximity to each other.

Thumbcuffs are rarely used due to an increased possibility of [[injury]], most commonly by tight cuffs blocking [[blood circulation]].  [[Handcuffs]] are usually used instead.

Thumbcuffs may also be used as improvised &amp;apos;&amp;apos;toecuffs&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by locking the [[big toe]]s in proximity to each other.

Thumbcuffs with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;double locks&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; have a lockspring which when engaged, usually using the top of the key, stops the thumbcuff from ratcheting tighter and prevents the subject from tightening them, possibly causing injury. Double locks also make picking the locks more difficult.
