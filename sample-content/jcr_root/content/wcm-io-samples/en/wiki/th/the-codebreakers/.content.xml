&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Codebreakers – The Story of Secret Writing&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ISBN 0-684-83130-9) is a book by [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]], published in 1967 comprehensively chronicling the [[history of cryptography]] from ancient [[Egypt]] to the time of its writing. The [[United States government]] attempted to have the book altered before publication, and succeeded in part.

==Overview==
Bradford Hardie III, an American cryptographer during World War II, contributed insider information, German translations from original documents, as well as intimate real-time operational explanations to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Codebreakers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

It is widely regarded as the best account of the [[history of cryptography]] up to its publication. [[William Crowell]], former deputy director of the [[National Security Agency]], was quoted in [[Newsday]] as saying &amp;quot;Before he (Kahn) came along, the best you could do was buy an explanatory book that usually was too technical and terribly dull.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://hnn.us/roundup/comments/7460.html David Kahn: Historian of Secret Codes] by Arnold Abrams, in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Newsday&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 2004-09-19 (no more available online (2013.02.27))&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Kahn, then a journalist, was contracted to write a book on cryptology in 1961. He began writing it part-time, at one point quitting his job to work on it full-time.&amp;lt;ref name=bamford&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Bamford|first=James|title=[[The Puzzle Palace]]|year=1982|pages=126–130}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The book was to include information on the NSA, and according to author [[James Bamford]] writing in 1982, the agency attempted to stop its publication, and considered various options, including writing a negative review of Kahn&amp;apos;s work to be published in the press to discredit him.&amp;lt;ref name=bamford /&amp;gt; A committee of the United States Intelligence Board concluded that the book was &amp;quot;a possibly valuable support to foreign [[COMSEC]] authorities&amp;quot; and recommended &amp;quot;further low-key actions as possible, but short of legal action, to discourage Mr. Kahn or his prospective publishers&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=bamford /&amp;gt; Kahn&amp;apos;s publisher, Macmillan, handed over the manuscript to the government for review without Kahn&amp;apos;s permission on 4 March 1966.&amp;lt;ref name=bamford /&amp;gt; Kahn and Macmillan eventually agreed to remove some material from the manuscript, particularly concerning the relationship between the NSA and its counterpart in the United Kingdom, [[GCHQ]].&amp;lt;ref name=bamford /&amp;gt;

Because of the year of its publication, the book did not cover most of the history concerning the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|breaking]] of the German [[Enigma machine]] (which became public knowledge only in the 1970s); hence, not much is said of [[Alan Turing]]. Nor did it cover the advent of strong cryptography in the public domain, beginning with the invention of [[public key cryptography]] and the specification of the [[Data Encryption Standard]] in the mid-1970s. The book finishes with [[SETI]].

The book was republished in 1996, and this new edition includes an additional chapter briefly covering the events since the original publication; see the &amp;quot;[[Books on cryptography]]&amp;quot; article for other works which cover this later history in more detail.
