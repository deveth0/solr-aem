&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Roundup&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a weekday afternoon program on the [[CBC Radio One|Radio One]] network of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], hosted by [[Tetsuro Shigematsu]] and [[Bill Richardson (radio)|Bill Richardson]] at different times. It was heard Monday to Friday from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. (2:30 to 4:30 in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]). The show mixed music with calls and letters from listeners, which were often comic in nature, and feature interviews. The show was produced by [[CBU (AM)|CBU]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]].

The show was originally hosted by [[Bill Richardson (radio)|Bill Richardson]] and called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Richardson&amp;apos;s Roundup&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It was created in 1997 to replace [[Vicki Gabereau]]&amp;apos;s show, when she left to do a television show with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]]. Shigematsu, an occasional guest host, became the show&amp;apos;s permanent host in 2004 when Richardson left to launch the new series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bunny Watson]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The show&amp;apos;s phone number was 1-888-SAD GOAT, and the goat was the symbol for the show.  Richardson discovered that the show&amp;apos;s phone number accidentally spelled out the phrase &amp;quot;sad goat&amp;quot;, and the concept was elaborated on ever since.

The phone number (723 4628) was to be 1 888 RADIO2U but when they realised how cumbersome that would be to explain, they looked for alternative spellings, and &amp;apos;sad goat&amp;apos; was born.

In 2005, the show was cancelled and replaced with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Freestyle (radio program)|Freestyle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
