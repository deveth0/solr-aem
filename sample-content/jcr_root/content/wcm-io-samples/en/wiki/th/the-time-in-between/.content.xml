&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Time in Between&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a novel by [[Canada|Canadian]] author [[David Bergen]]. It deals with a man named Charles Boatman, who mysteriously returns to [[Vietnam]], where he had been a soldier earlier in his life, and his children, Ada and Jon, who also go to Vietnam to search for him.

Although generally called a [[war novel]], the author states that he &amp;quot;[doesn&amp;apos;t] see &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Time in Between&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as a war novel&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.mcclelland.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780771011788]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Time in Between&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the recipient of the 2005 [[Scotiabank Giller Prize]].
