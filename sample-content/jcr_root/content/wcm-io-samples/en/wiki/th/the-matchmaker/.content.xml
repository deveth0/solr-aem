&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Matchmaker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a play by [[Thornton Wilder]].

The play has a long and colorful history. [[John Oxenford]]&amp;apos;s 1835 one-act [[farce]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Day Well Spent&amp;apos;&amp;apos; had been extended into a full-length play entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Einen Jux will er sich machen]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Austria]]n [[playwright]] [[Johann Nestroy]] in 1842. In 1938, Wilder adapted Nestroy&amp;apos;s version into an [[United States|Americanized]] [[comedy]] entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Merchant of Yonkers]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which attracted the attention of [[Germany|German]] [[Theatre director|director]] [[Max Reinhardt]], who mounted a [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] production.  It was a dismal failure, running for a mere 39 performances.

Fifteen years later, director [[Tyrone Guthrie]] expressed interest in a new production of the play, which Wilder extensively rewrote and rechristened &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Matchmaker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The most significant change was the expansion of a previously minor character named Dolly Gallagher Levi, who became the play&amp;apos;s centerpiece. A widow who brokers marriages and other transactions in [[Yonkers, New York]] at the turn of the 20th Century, she sets her sights on local merchant Horace Vandergelder, who has hired her to find him a wife. After a series of [[slapstick]] situations involving mistaken identities, secret rendezvous behind carefully placed screens, separated lovers, and a trip to night court, everyone finds themselves paired with a perfect match.

The play was a success at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in [[Scotland]] and at the [[Theatre Royal Drury Lane]] in [[London]]&amp;apos;s [[West End theatre|West End]] before finally opening on Broadway on December 5, 1955 at the [[Royale Theatre]], later transferring to the [[Booth Theatre|Booth]] to complete its run of 486 performances. [[Ruth Gordon]]&amp;apos;s performance in the title role earned her a [[Tony Award]] nomination as Best Actress; Guthrie won as Best Director.

The [[The Matchmaker (1958 film)|1958 film version]], adapted by [[John Michael Hayes]] and directed by [[Joseph Anthony]], starred [[Shirley Booth]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Come Back, Little Sheba (1952 film)|Come Back, Little Sheba]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) as Dolly, [[Anthony Perkins]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) as Cornelius, [[Shirley MacLaine]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Terms of Endearment]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) as Irene, [[Paul Ford]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Music Man (film)|The Music Man]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) as Vandergelder, and [[Robert Morse]] reprising his Broadway role as Barnaby.

In 1964, the play enjoyed yet another incarnation when [[David Merrick]], who had produced the 1955 Broadway production, mounted a hugely successful, [[Tony Award]]-winning musical version entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, with a score by [[Jerry Herman]] and starring [[Carol Channing]].

A [[Hello, Dolly! (film)|film version of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hello, Dolly!&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] was released in 1969 starring [[Barbra Streisand]] in the lead role.

The 1981 [[Tom Stoppard]] [[farce]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[On the Razzle (play)|On the Razzle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also is based on the same story.
