&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Blue Ox Babes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were an [[England|English]] [[pop music|pop]] group, formed in early 1981 by the former [[Dexys Midnight Runners]] guitarist [[Kevin Archer|Kevin &amp;apos;Al&amp;apos; Archer]], together with his girlfriend Yasmin Saleh, and former Dexys keyboard player [[Andy Leek]]. Archer was keen to mix the [[soul music|soul]] sounds of his previous group with folk styles. To this end he recruited fiddle player [[Helen O&amp;apos;Hara]] to play on demo tapes of the new songs he had written. When former colleague [[Kevin Rowland]] heard these demo tapes, he invited O&amp;apos;Hara to join Dexys, and adopted a similarly folk-influenced sound for his own group.

By the time The Blue Ox Babes finally released their debut single &amp;quot;There&amp;apos;s No Deceiving You&amp;quot; on [[Go! Discs Records|Go! Discs]] in 1988, the line-up consisted of Archer (guitar and vocals), Saleh (backing vocals), Pete Wain (piano), Nick Smith (saxophone), Ian Pettitt (drums), former Dexys members Steve &amp;apos;Brennan&amp;apos; Shaw (fiddle), and Steve Wynne (bass).

&amp;quot;There&amp;apos;s No Deceiving You&amp;quot; was only a minor chart entry, peaking at No.&amp;amp;nbsp;92 UK.  Two other singles, &amp;quot;Apples and Oranges&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Walking On The Line&amp;quot;, were released, but sales were disappointing and these singles did not chart.  A planned album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Apples &amp;amp; Oranges&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was recorded by the group but shelved, and the Blue Ox Babes broke up shortly thereafter.

In 2009, a CD of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Apples &amp;amp; Oranges&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was finally released, containing all their recordings for Go! Discs, through [[Cherry Red Records]]. The package included all their singles plus many unreleased songs - and several additional demos were also made available as downloads.
