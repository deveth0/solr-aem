        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Digital Village&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;TDV&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was a digital media company based in
[[Covent Garden]], [[London]] WC2 in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was founded in 1994.  The [[science fiction]]/[[comedy]] [[writer]] [[Douglas Adams]] was one of the founding members, along with [[Robbie Stamp]], who is the Executive Producer of the [[The Hitchhiker&amp;apos;s Guide to the Galaxy (film)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hitchhiker&amp;apos;s Guide to the Galaxy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] movie, released worldwide in 2005. At its highest point in October 2000, the company had over 40 employees.

TDV produced the [[video game]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Starship Titanic]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,  and started [[H2G2|h2g2]], a community site dedicated to producing what is referred to as the [[Earth]] edition of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Hitchhiker&amp;apos;s Guide to the Galaxy]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The company was renamed after its main asset in 2000, to h2g2. Following the [[dot-com crash]] in 2001, many h2g2 staff continued to work without pay until the h2g2 site, brand and several staff moved to the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]. The game division became a new company, Phase 3 Studios, which continued for several months under the ownership of PAN Interactive, but ultimately closed in 2002. The 3D game of The Hitchhiker&amp;apos;s Guide to the Galaxy it was working on was never released.

Adams died suddenly on May 11, 2001, although the company&amp;apos;s fate had already been sealed by that time.
