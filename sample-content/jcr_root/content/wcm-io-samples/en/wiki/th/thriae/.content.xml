The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thriae&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thriai&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were [[nymphs]], three virginal sisters, one of a number of such triads (&amp;quot;maiden trinities&amp;quot; [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] called them) in [[Greek mythology]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Hesiod]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Theogony]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; gives the [[Gorgon]], the [[Horae]], the [[Moirai]], and the [[Charites]]; later myth adds the [[Erinyes]], the [[Graiae]], the [[Siren]]s, the [[Hesperides]], and [[cult (religion)|Greek cult]] has given more: see the list in Scheinberg 1979:2.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; They received names [[Melaina]] (&amp;quot;the Black&amp;quot;), [[Kleodora]] (&amp;quot;Famed for her Gift&amp;quot;), and [[Daphnis (nymph)|Daphnis]] (&amp;quot;Laurel&amp;quot;); however, in the page in the Corycian nymphs, the third sister is listed as Corycia. They were the three [[Naiad]]s ([[nymph]]s) of the sacred springs of the [[Corycian Cave]] of [[Mount Parnassus]] in [[Phocis]].

Corycia was the sister whom the [[Corycian Cave]] was named after. She was the mother of [[Lycoreus]] with [[Apollo]].

Kleodora was loved by [[Poseidon]]. With Poseidon (or Kleopompos) she was the mother of Parnassos, who founded the city of Parnassus. ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 10.6.13).

Melaina was loved by [[Apollo]], bearing him [[Delphus|Delphos]]. Another tradition names [[Thyia]] as the mother of Delphos. Her name meant &amp;quot;the black,&amp;quot; suggesting she presides over [[Underworld#Greek mythology|subterranean]] nymphs.
