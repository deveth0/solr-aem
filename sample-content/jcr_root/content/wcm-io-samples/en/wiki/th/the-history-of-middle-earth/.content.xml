&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The History of Middle-earth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 12-volume series of books published between 1983 and 1996 that collect and analyse material relating to the fiction of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], compiled and edited by his son, [[Christopher Tolkien]]. The series shows the development over time of Tolkien&amp;apos;s conception of [[Middle-Earth]] as a fictional place with its own peoples, languages, and history, from his earliest notions of a &amp;quot;mythology for England&amp;quot; through to the development of the stories that make up &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Silmarillion]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Lord of the Rings]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It is not a &amp;quot;history of Middle-Earth&amp;quot; in the sense of being a chronicle of events in Middle-Earth written from an in-universe perspective. In 2000–01, the twelve volumes were republished in three limited edition omnibus volumes. Non-deluxe editions of the three volumes were published in 2002.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/gallery.php?subsection=81&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Contents==
Some of the content consists of earlier versions of already published works, while other portions are new material. These books are extremely detailed, often analysing a scrap of paper to provide the full evolution of two or even three different versions of a passage that were rewritten over each other. Despite the great amount of material in the twelve volumes, numerous unpublished texts are still known to exist&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Citation|title=My father&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;eviscerated&amp;quot; work -- son of Hobbit scribe J.R.R.

The first five books track the early history of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Silmarillion]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and related texts.  Books six to nine discuss the development of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Lord of the Rings]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; book nine also discusses the [[Númenor]] story in the form of [[The Notion Club Papers]]. Books ten and eleven return to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Silmarillion&amp;apos;&amp;apos; material, including the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Annals of [[Beleriand]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Annals of Aman]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Book twelve discusses the development of the Appendices to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Lord of the Rings]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and assorted writings from the last years of Tolkien&amp;apos;s life.
