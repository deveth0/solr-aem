&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Love of The Last Tycoon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an unfinished novel by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], compiled and published posthumously.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/12/24/specials/fitzgerald-tycoon.html|publisher=The New York Times|title=Scott Fitzgerald&amp;apos;s Last Novel|date=1941-11-09|accessdate=2012-03-12|author=J. Donald Adams}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Publication history==
The novel was unfinished and in rough form at the time of Fitzgerald&amp;apos;s death at age 44. The notes for the novel were initially collected and edited by the literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]], who was a close friend of Fitzgerald, and the [[unfinished work|unfinished novel]] was published in 1941 as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Last Tycoon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, though there is now critical agreement that Fitzgerald intended &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Love of the Last Tycoon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to be the book&amp;apos;s title. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} It was not until the 1993 publication, as part of the Cambridge edition of the Works of F Scott Fitzgerald, edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli, that the work first appeared as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Love of the Last Tycoon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The extant seventeen chapters of the thirty-one planned chapters were reassembled in 1993 by Bruccoli according to the author&amp;apos;s notes.

==Plot summary==
According to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Publishers Weekly&amp;apos;s&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1993 review of the edition reconstructed by Fitzgerald scholar Matthew J. Bruccoli, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Love of the Last Tycoon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is &amp;quot;[g]enerally considered a [[roman a clef]]&amp;quot;, inspired by the life of film producer [[Irving Thalberg]], on whom protagonist Monroe Stahr is based. The story follows Stahr&amp;apos;s rise to power in Hollywood, and his conflicts with rival Pat Brady, a character based on studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]].

==Main characters==
*Monroe Stahr,  Hollywood film producer
*Bradogue Brady, Stahr’s associate, also a film producer
*Cecelia Brady, Brady&amp;apos;s daughter
*Kathleen Moore, Stahr&amp;apos;s love interest

==Point of view==
Fitzgerald wrote the novel in a blend of [[first-person narration|first person]] and [[third-person omniscient narrative]]. While the story is ostensibly told by Cecelia, many scenes are narrated in which she is not present. Occasionally a scene will be presented twice, once through Cecelia and once through a third party.

==Awards==
The revised edition of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Love of The Last Tycoon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; won the Choice Outstanding Academic Books award of 1995.

==Adaptations==
In 1957 [[John Frankenheimer]] directed a TV version for [[Playhouse 90]], with [[Jack Palance]] as Monroe Stahr.

A 1976 film version was adapted for the screen by [[Nobel Prize]] winning playwright [[Harold Pinter]], directed by [[Elia Kazan]] (his last film), produced by [[Sam Spiegel]], and released as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Last Tycoon (film)|The Last Tycoon]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  It starred [[Robert De Niro]] as Monroe Stahr and [[Theresa Russell]] as Cecelia Brady, and featured appearances by [[Robert Mitchum]] and [[Jack Nicholson]].

A stage adaptation, authorized by the Fitzgerald Estate, by [[Simon Levy]] opened at [[The Fountain Theatre]] in Los Angeles in 1998  to rave reviews and was the recipient of numerous awards.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.fountaintheatre.com/admin/html]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
