&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Halo Benders&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a band formed in 1994 as a side project by [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]] of [[Beat Happening]] and [[Doug Martsch]] of [[Built to Spill]].  They released their first album, called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[God Don&amp;apos;t Make No Junk]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in 1994. They followed up in 1996 with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Don&amp;apos;t Tell Me Now]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and in 1998 with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Rebels Not In]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

All three of the band&amp;apos;s albums were released on Johnson&amp;apos;s influential Olympia record label, [[K Records]].

Following a hiatus through the early 2000s, the Halo Benders reformed in March 2007 for a pair of shows at the Visual Arts Collective in Boise, ID.  The band featured [[Doug Martsch]], [[Ralf Youtz]], [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]], [[Caustic Resin|Bret Netson]], and Stephen Gere. Recently in November 2010, a reformed version with both Doug and Calvin appeared for a benefit for Friends of Mia at the Capital Theatre in Olympia,WA.

==Music==
The Halo Benders&amp;apos; music is characterised by untraditional sounds, movements, and song structures.  The vocals of the baritone Johnson and the higher-pitched Martsch have been described as highly contrasting - &amp;quot;each seems to inhabit a completely different song.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;PitchAug2010&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web| url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7854-the-top-200-tracks-of-the-1990s-200-151/2/ |title=188.
