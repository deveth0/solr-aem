== History ==
Canada had been without a national [[encyclopedia]] since the 1957 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Encyclopedia Canadiana]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In response, in the 1980s the [[Canadian nationalism|Canadian nationalist]] [[Mel Hurtig]] launched a project to create a wholly new Canadian encyclopedia with support from Alberta Premier [[Peter Lougheed]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-notebook/how-canada-got-an-encyclopedia-to-call-its-own/article1747473/ &amp;quot;How Canada got an encyclopedia to call its own&amp;quot;] Jane Taber, [[The Globe and Mail]]. 7 October 2010&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The Editor in chief [[James Harley Marsh]] recruited more than 3,000 authors to write for it.

The first edition of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Canadian Encyclopedia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was published in three volumes in 1985 (ISBN 0-88830-269-X) and was a Canadian bestseller (150,000 sets sold in six months), and a revised and expanded edition was released in 1988 (ISBN 0-88830-326-2). In September 1990, Hurtig published the five-volume &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Junior Encyclopedia of Canada&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ISBN 0-88830-334-3), the first encyclopedia for young Canadians.

Hurtig sold his publishing company to McClelland &amp;amp; Stewart in May 1991 and with it the encyclopedia.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ce&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;amp;Params=A1ARTA0003924 &amp;quot;Mel Hurtig&amp;quot;] The Canadian Encyclopedia&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 1995, McClelland &amp;amp; Stewart published the first digital [[CD-ROM]] edition (ISBN 0-7710-2041-4). Today, [[The Historica Dominion Institute]], a not-for-profit foundation, publishes the encyclopedia for free online.

When McClelland &amp;amp; Stewart took over &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Canadian Encyclopedia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; archives that Hurtig had left behind in an East York warehouse, thousands of original photographs, recordings, letters and other research materials which had been used in the production of the publication were destroyed, most simply thrown in the trash.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}
