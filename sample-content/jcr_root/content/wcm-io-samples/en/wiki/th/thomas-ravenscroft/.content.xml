&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thomas Ravenscroft&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{circa|1582 or 1592}} &amp;amp;ndash; 1635) was an [[English people|English]] musician, theorist and editor, notable as a [[composer]] of [[round (music)|rounds]] and [[Catch (music)|catches]], and especially for compiling collections of British [[folk music]].

Little is known of Ravenscroft&amp;apos;s early life. He probably sang in the [[choir]] of [[St. Paul&amp;apos;s Cathedral]] from 1594, when a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thomas Raniscroft&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was listed on the choir rolls and remained there until 1600 under the directorship of [[Thomas Giles]]. He probably received his bachelor&amp;apos;s degree in 1605 from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].

Ravenscroft&amp;apos;s principal contributions are his collections of [[folk music]], including catches, rounds, [[street cries]], vendor songs, &amp;quot;freeman&amp;apos;s songs&amp;quot; and other anonymous music, in three collections: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pammelia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1609), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Deuteromelia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Seconde Part of Musicks Melodie&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1609) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Melismata&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1611). Some of the music he compiled has acquired extraordinary fame, though his name is rarely associated with the music; for example &amp;quot;[[Three Blind Mice]]&amp;quot; first appears in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Deuteromelia.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (1951)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He also published a [[metrical psalter]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Whole Booke of Psalmes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) in 1621. As a composer, his works are mostly forgotten but include 11 [[anthem]]s, 3 [[motet]]s for five voices and 4 [[fantasia (music)|fantasia]]s for [[viol]]s.

As a writer, he wrote two treatises on [[music theory]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Briefe Discourse of the True (but Neglected) Use of Charact&amp;apos;ring the Degrees&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (London, 1614), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Treatise of Musick&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which remains in manuscript (unpublished).
