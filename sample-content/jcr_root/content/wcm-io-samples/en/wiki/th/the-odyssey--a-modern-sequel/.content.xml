&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an epic poem by [[Greece|Greek]] poet and philosopher [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], based on [[Homer]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Odyssey]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It is divided into twenty-four [[Rhapsody (music)|rhapsodies]] as is the original &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Odyssey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and consists of 33,333 17-syllable verses. Kazantzakis began working on it in 1924 after he returned to [[Crete]] from [[Germany]]. Before finally publishing the poem in 1938 he had drafted seven different versions. Kazantzakis considered this his most important work. It was fully translated into English in 1958 by [[Kimon Friar]].

==Synopsis==
[[Odysseus]] (Ulysses) returns to [[Ithaca]] and decides to undertake new adventures after he quickly becomes unsatisfied with his quiet family life. First he travels to [[Sparta]] to save [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], the wife of the king of Sparta [[Menelaus]], whose abduction by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] had led to the [[Trojan War]]. He goes to Crete where a conspiracy dethrones the king. There he abandons Helen and continues to [[Egypt]] where again a workers&amp;apos; uprising takes place. He leaves again on a journey up the Nile eventually stopping at the lake-source. Upon arrival his companions set up camp and he climbs the mountain in order to concentrate on his god. Upon his return to the lake he sets up his city based on the commandments of his religion. The city is soon destroyed by an earthquake. Odysseus laments his failure to understand the true meaning of god with the sacrifice of his companions. His life transforms into that of an [[asceticism|ascetic]]. Odysseus meets Motherth (an incarnation of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]), Kapetán Énas (English: Captain Sole, literally &amp;quot;Captain One&amp;quot;, a Greek folk expression for people who are insubordinate and single-minded to a fault), alias [[Don Quixote]], and an African village fisherman, alias [[Jesus]]. He travels further south in Africa while constantly spreading his religion and fighting the advances of death. Eventually he travels to [[Antarctica]] and lives with villagers for a year until an iceberg kills him. His death is glorious as it marks his rebirth and unification with the world.

==Themes==
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Odyssey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; represents Kazantzakis&amp;apos; ideology and metaphysical concerns. A central theme is the importance of struggle for its own sake, as opposed to reaching a final goal.
