&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The World of the Partridge Family&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a compilation album made by [[The Partridge Family]].  This double album, the last Partridge Family album put out by Bell, features 20 already-released Partridge Family songs. This album was renumbered as Arista 4021 when Bell changed into [[Arista Records|Arista]] in 1976. No new copies were printed, however - existing copies were merely shipped under the new Arista code number. Only albums released in 1974 were renumbered. [[David Cassidy]] solo LPs likewise were also renumbered.

Released April 1974, Bell Records
