&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thomas Cartwright&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (c. 1535 &amp;amp;ndash; 27 December 1603) was an [[England|English]] [[Puritan]] churchman.
==Background and education==
Cartwright was born in [[Hertfordshire]], and studied divinity at [[St John&amp;apos;s College, Cambridge]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Venn|id=CRTT547T|name=Cartwright, Thomas}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; On the accession of Queen [[Mary I of England]] in 1553, he was forced to leave the university, and found occupation as clerk to a counsellor-at-law. On the accession of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], five years later, he resumed his [[theology|theological]] studies, and was soon afterwards elected a fellow of St John&amp;apos;s and later of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].
==Theological stance==
In 1564 Cartwright opposed [[Thomas Preston (writer)|Thomas Preston]] in a theological disputation held on the occasion of Elizabeth&amp;apos;s state visit, and in the following year brought attention to the Puritan attitude on church ceremonial and organization. He was popular in [[Ireland]] as chaplain to [[Adam Loftus (Archbishop)|Adam Loftus]], [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] (1565-1567). In 1569, Cartwright was appointed [[Lady Margaret&amp;apos;s Professor of Divinity]] at Cambridge; but [[John Whitgift]], on becoming vice-chancellor, deprived him of the post in December 1570, and—as master of Trinity—of his fellowship in September 1571.

This was a result of the use which Cartwright had made of his position; he criticised the hierarchy and constitution of the [[Church of England]], which he compared unfavourably with the primitive Christian organization. So keen was the struggle between him and Whitgift that the chancellor, [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], had to intervene. After his deprivation by Whitgift, Cartwright visited [[Theodore Beza]] at [[Geneva]]. He returned to England in 1572, and might have become professor of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] at Cambridge but for his expressed sympathy with the notorious &amp;quot;Admonition to the Parliament&amp;quot; by [[John Field (divine)|John Field]] and [[Thomas Wilcox]]. To escape arrest he again went abroad, and officiated as clergyman to the English residents at [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]] and then at [[Middelburg]].
==Later years==
In 1576 Cartwright visited and organized the [[Huguenot]] churches of the [[Channel Islands]], and after revising the Rhenish version of the [[New Testament]], again settled as pastor at Antwerp, declining the offer of a chair at the [[University of St Andrews]]. In 1585 he returned without permission to London, was imprisoned for a short time, and became master of the [[Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]]&amp;apos;s hospital at Warwick. In 1590 he was summoned before the court of high commission and imprisoned, and in 1591 he was once more committed to the [[Fleet prison]]. He was not treated harshly, and powerful influence soon secured his release. He visited [[Guernsey]] (1595-1598), and spent his closing years in honour and prosperity at Warwick, where he died in the same year as the queen.
==Qualities and character==
Cartwright was a man of much culture and originality, but said to be exceedingly impulsive. His views were distinctly [[Presbyterian]], and he stoutly opposed the [[Brownists]] or Independents. He never conceived of a separation between church and state, and may have refused to tolerate any [[non-conformity]] with the reformed national Presbyterian church. However, it is believed that the Puritanism of the day owed its systematization and much of its force to him.
