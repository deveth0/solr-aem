&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Dissociatives&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are an [[Australia]]n band consisting of [[Daniel Johns]] of [[Silverchair]], Australian dance producer [[DJ]] [[Paul Mac]], and touring members [[Julian Hamilton]] and [[Kim Moyes]] from Sydney electronic duo &amp;quot;[[The Presets]]&amp;quot;. Their first single &amp;quot;[[Somewhere Down the Barrel]]&amp;quot; entered the Australian Top 40 charts on debut on 15 March 2004, reached #8 that week{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}, and was one of the five most played tracks on Australian radio in March. The debut album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Dissociatives (album)|The Dissociatives]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was released on 4 April 2004.

==I Can&amp;apos;t Believe It&amp;apos;s Not Rock==
Daniel Johns and Paul Mac met in 1997 when Paul Mac remixed &amp;quot;Freak&amp;quot; from Silverchair&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Freak Show (album)|Freak Show]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; album. The two became friends and Paul Mac worked on the subsequent Silverchair albums &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Neon Ballroom]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Diorama (album)|Diorama]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Young Modern]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The two worked on the experimental &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[I Can&amp;apos;t Believe It&amp;apos;s Not Rock]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; EP released in 2000.

==The making of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Dissociatives&amp;apos;&amp;apos; album==
In mid-2003, Daniel Johns and Paul Mac got together to produce the album recording the basic tracks in [[London]] and finishing it off in [[Sydney]] and [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]. The pair produced all the instrumental tracks and vocals themselves with Johns writing the lyrics and recording them in Newcastle.

The pair described the music and lyrics in the April 2004 Australian edition of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Rolling Stone magazine|Rolling Stone]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. &amp;quot;The music is, for me, a combination of excitement, happiness, rambunctiousness and viciousness, done to whimsy,&amp;quot; Johns said. &amp;quot;I&amp;apos;d add with a hint of melancholy, but it&amp;apos;s more outweighed by joy,&amp;quot; added Mac.

The pair, in an interview on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Rove (TV series)|Rove Live]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; that the musical journey of The Dissociatives is &amp;quot;definitely not a side project&amp;quot; and that they plan to release more interesting and groundbreaking music in the future under this guise. However, at the moment the band is on hiatus, due to their current projects, i.e. Johns with Silverchair, Mac with a contracted two-year commitment to live performances with Silverchair &amp;amp; [[The Presets]], the band of [[Julian Hamilton]] and [[Kim Moyes]], currently touring.
