&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Tay Bridge Disaster&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; is a [[poem]] written in 1880 by the Scottish poet, [[William McGonagall]], who has been widely acclaimed as the worst poet in history.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;poet&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite|author=William McGonagall |title=World&amp;apos;s Worst Poet: Selections from &amp;quot;Poetic Gems&amp;quot;
|publisher=Templegate Publishers|date=1992}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The poem recounts the [[Tay Bridge disaster|events of the evening]] of December 28, 1879, when, during a severe gale, the [[Tay Rail Bridge]] at [[Dundee, Scotland|Dundee]] collapsed as a train was passing over it with the loss of all on board (now thought to be 75 people, not 90 as stated in the poem). The foundations of the bridge were not removed and are alongside the existing newer bridge.

The poem is by far the most famous ever written by McGonagall, and is still widely quoted. It begins:

:&amp;quot;Beautiful railway bridge of the silv&amp;apos;ry Tay
:Alas! I am very sorry to say
:That ninety lives have been taken away
:On the last sabbath day of 1879
:Which will be remember&amp;apos;d for a very long time.&amp;quot;

And it ends:

:&amp;quot;Oh! Ill-fated bridge of the silv&amp;apos;ry Tay,
:I now must conclude my lay
:By telling the world fearlessly without the least dismay,
:That your central girders would not have given way,
:At least many sensible men do say,
:Had they been supported on each side with buttresses
:At least many sensible men confesses,
:For the stronger we our houses do build,
:The less chance we have of being killed.&amp;quot;

William McGonagall wrote two other poems in praise of the Tay Bridge. The first one begins as follows:

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:

:&amp;quot;Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay!
:With your numerous arches and pillars in so grand array,
:And your central girders, which seem to the eye
:To be almost towering to the sky&amp;quot;

And it ends:

:&amp;quot;Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay!
:I hope that God will protect all passengers
:By night and by day,
:And that no accident will befall them while crossing
:The Bridge of the Silvery Tay,
:For that would be most awful to be seen
:Near by Dundee and the Magdalen Green.


:Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay!
:And prosperity to Messrs Bouche and Grothe,
:The famous engineers of the present day,
:Who have succeeded in erecting the Railway
:Bridge of the Silvery Tay,
:Which stands unequalled to be seen
:Near by Dundee and the Magdalen Green.&amp;quot;

After the original bridge collapsed, a new one was built, providing the opportunity for another poem, which begins:

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;An Address to the New Tay Bridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

:&amp;quot;BEAUTIFUL new railway bridge of the Silvery Tay,
:With your strong brick piers and buttresses in so grand array,
:And your thirteen central girders, which seem to my eye
:Strong enough all windy storms to defy.&amp;quot;
