        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thanhouser Company&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (later the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thanhouser Film Corporation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was one of the first motion picture studios, founded in 1909 by [[Edwin Thanhouser]]. It operated until 1918.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120182236 |title=From The Vaults, A Look At Early Indie-Movie History |author= Bellamy Pailthorp |date=November 11, 2009 |work=All Things Considered |publisher=National Public Radio}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Thanhouser produced over 1,000 [[silent film]]s. Among these were:
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Cry of the Children]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:  Selected in 2011 by the National Film Preservation Board of the [[Library of Congress]] for inclusion in the [[National Film Registry]], which recognizes films for their cultural, historical and aesthetic significance.&amp;lt;ref name=FilmRegistryBoxChocolates&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2011/11-240.html |date=December 28, 2011 |title=2011 National Film Registry More Than a Box of Chocolates}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The Film Preservation Board described this two-reel [[melodrama]] from 1912, part of which was filmed in a working [[textile mill]], as a &amp;quot;key work&amp;quot; in relation to the U.S. movement for [[child labor]] reform in the years before World War I. According to the Film Preservation Board, an &amp;quot;influential critic of the time&amp;quot; called it &amp;quot;the boldest, most timely and most effective appeal for the stamping out of the cruelest of all social abuses.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=FilmRegistryBoxChocolates/&amp;gt;
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Evidence of the Film]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:  A 15-minute film from 1913, among the 25 films selected for the National Film Registry in 2001&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/film/nfr2001.html |title=Librarian of Congress Names 25 More Films to National Film Registry |date=December 18, 2001}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[When the Studio Burned]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:  On January 13, 1913 (three days after the release of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Evidence of the Film&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), the main facility of the Thanhouser studio in [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], [[New York (state)|New York]] burned to the ground.  Most of the negatives in the studio&amp;apos;s film library were saved.  However, in the scramble to save lives, business files and the film library, none of the company&amp;apos;s cameramen were able to set up their equipment until after the studio was a smoldering ruin.  Thanks to Thanhouser&amp;apos;s recent acquisitions of production facilities in Los Angeles and Chicago, the studio was able to produce this 14 minute fictional film about the fire.  The film, which included many of the studio&amp;apos;s stars appearing as themselves recreating their escape from the fire, was released on February 4, 1913.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://thanhouser.org/films/studio_burned.htm |title=When the Studio Burned |date=February 24, 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
