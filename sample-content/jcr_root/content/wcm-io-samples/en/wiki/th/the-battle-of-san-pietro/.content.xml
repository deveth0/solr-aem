&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Battle of San Pietro&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 1945 [[documentary film]] directed by [[John Huston]] about the [[Battle of San Pietro Infine]] during [[World War II]]. It was shot by Jules Buck.

Huston and his crew were attached to the [[U.S. Army]]’s [[143rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|143rd Regiment]] of the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Division]].  Unlike many other military documentaries, Huston’s cameramen filmed alongside the infantrymen as they fought their way up the hills to reach San Pietro.  These cameramen were in just as much danger as the soldiers on the ground, often within a few feet of mortars and shells exploding and bullets ricocheting nearby.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Haskew, Michael E. “San Pietro capturing the face of war.”  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Military History&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Dec. 2000, Vol. 17 Issue 5, p. 52.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The film is unflinching in its realism&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;One scene includes close-up views of the faces of dead soldiers as they are being loaded into [[body bag]]s, a level of realism unheard of in both fictional portrayals as well as newsreel footage of the time.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and was held up from being shown to the public by the [[United States Army]]. Huston quickly became unpopular with the Army, not only for the film but also for his response to the accusation that the film was anti-war. Huston responded that if he ever made a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;pro&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-war film, he should be shot.

Because it showed dead GIs wrapped in mattress covers, some officers tried to prevent soldiers in training from seeing it, for fear of damaging morale.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;oneill258&amp;quot;&amp;gt;William L. O&amp;apos;Neill, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Democracy At War: America&amp;apos;s Fight At Home and Abroad in World War II&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p. 258 ISBN 0-02-923678-9&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  General [[George Marshall]] came to Huston and the film&amp;apos;s defense, stating that because of the film&amp;apos;s gritty realism, it would make a good [[training film]].  The depiction of death would inspire soldiers to take their training more seriously.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;oneill258&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  Subsequently the film was used for that purpose. Huston was no longer considered a pariah; he was decorated and eventually promoted to major.

In 1991, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Battle of San Pietro&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being &amp;quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&amp;quot;.
