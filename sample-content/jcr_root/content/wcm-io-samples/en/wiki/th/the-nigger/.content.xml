It explores the relationship between [[black people|blacks]] and [[white people|whites]] in the melodrama of a politician faced with a sudden, personal dilemma. The play was first performed on Broadway in [[New York City]] at [[Century Theatre (New York City)|The New Theatre]] on December 4, 1909.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; Anthony Slide, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;American Racist: The Life and Films of Thomas Dixon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (University Press of Kentucky, 2004), p65&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The play was adapted to a novel, and a film adaptation, directed by [[Edgar Lewis]], was made in 1915.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/dfs_18/dfs_18_00018.html  novelguide.com]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Because the title was controversial, the film was released in some markets as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The New Governor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
