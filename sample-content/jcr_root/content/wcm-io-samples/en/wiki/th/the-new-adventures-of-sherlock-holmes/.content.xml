        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[old-time radio]] show which aired in the [[United States of America|USA]] from October 2, 1939 to July 7, 1947. Most episodes were written by the team of Dennis Green and [[Anthony Boucher]].

Originally, the show starred [[Basil Rathbone]] as [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Nigel Bruce]] as [[Doctor Watson]]. Together, they starred in 220 episodes which aired weekly on Mondays from 8:30 to 9:00pm. [[Bromo Quinine]] sponsored some of the earlier programs on the NBC Blue Network and for a period Parker Pen was the sponsor. The show first aired on the [[Blue Network]] but later moved to the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]]. It was originally broadcast from Hollywood. During [[World War II]], the show was also broadcast overseas through the [[Old-time_radio#Armed_Forces_Radio_Service|Armed Forces Radio Service]]. It is unknown exactly how many of the original 220 shows have survived, 53 are currently known to be in circulation.

Basil Rathbone&amp;apos;s last episode as the famous Detective was &amp;quot;The Singular Affair of the Baconian Cipher.&amp;quot; He was eager to separate himself from the show to avoid being typecast as Sherlock Holmes, and even though the show&amp;apos;s sponsor [[Petri Wine]] offered him generous pay to continue, he decided to move on. Once he did, the sponsor did as well, and [[Tom Conway]] took the starring role, though Nigel Bruce got top billing and was always announced first. The new sponsor was [[Kreml Hair Tonic for Men]], and the new series lasted only 39 episodes. Tom Conway was replaced midseason by John Stanley. The show was later sponsored by [[Clipper Craft]] menswear and broadcast from New York City.

With Rathbone and Bruce, the show exhibited an interesting introduction. The sponsor&amp;apos;s spokesman, usually [[Harry Bartell]], or, during the show&amp;apos;s initial season and again in the final season, Joseph Bell, would show up weekly at Dr. Watson&amp;apos;s house (then retired and living in [[California]]), and share a story about Holmes and his adventures over a glass of Petri wine. This offered them the chance to sometimes bring in other characters to contribute to the story, and also gave Watson a chance to summarize or add additional titbits at the end. Another interesting thing about this radio show&amp;apos;s introductions was Dr. Watson&amp;apos;s anecdotes and comments about his [[dogs]] usually referred to as the &amp;quot;Puppies.&amp;quot;
