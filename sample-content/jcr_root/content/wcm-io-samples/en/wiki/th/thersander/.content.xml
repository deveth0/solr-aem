        text="&lt;p&gt;In [[Greek mythology]], the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thersander&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-el|Θέρσανδρος}}) refers to several distinct characters, the most prominent of whom is Thersander the son of Polynices.

==Thersander, son of Polynices==
In [[Homer]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Iliad]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thersander&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was one of the [[Epigoni]], who attacked the city of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] in retaliation for the deaths of their fathers, the [[Seven Against Thebes]], who had attempted the same thing.  He was the son of [[Polynices]] and [[Argea]].

Thersander may have bribed [[Eriphyle]] with the robe of [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] so that she sent her son, [[Alcmaeon (mythology)|Alcmaeon]], to fight with him.  His father did the same with Harmonia&amp;apos;s necklace to convince her to send her husband with the original attackers.  The attack of the Epigoni was successful, and Thersander became the king of Thebes.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Apollodorus. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Library&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 3.7.2.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Thersander intended to fight for the Greeks during the [[Trojan War]], but was killed by [[Telephus]] before the war began, while the Greeks had mistakenly stopped in [[Mysia]]. He was succeeded by his son [[Tisamenus (disambiguation)|Tisamenus]], whose mother was [[Demonassa]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Pausanias. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Description of Greece&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 9.36.1.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Pindar]] refers to Thersander as gaining honor after Polynices&amp;apos; death and preserving the house of [[Adrastus]] for later generations.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Pindar, Olymp. 2.42-45.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Other characters==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thersander&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also refers to:
*Thersander, a son of [[Sisyphus]], brother of [[Glaucus (son of Sisyphus)|Glaucus]], [[Ornytion]] and [[Almus (son of Sisyphus)|Almus]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Description of Greece&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 2. 4. 3&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; His own sons were Haliartus and [[Coronus (Greek mythology)|Coronus]], eponyms of [[Haliartus]] and [[Coronea]] respectively,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Pausanias, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Description of Greece&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 9. 34. 7&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. vv.  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Haliartos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Korōneia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and also Proetus, himself father of Maera who was known to have died a maiden.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Pausanias, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Description of Greece&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 10. 30. 5&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
