        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thomas Gataker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (September 1574 â€“ July 1654) was an [[England|English]] clergyman and theologian.

==Life==

He was born in [[London]], the son of [[Thomas Gatacre]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Gatacre, Thomas}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was educated at [[St John&amp;apos;s College, Cambridge]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Venn|GTKR593T}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  From 1601 to 1611 he held the appointment of preacher to the society of [[Lincoln&amp;apos;s Inn]], which he resigned on accepting the rectory of [[Rotherhithe]]. In 1642 he was chosen a member of the [[Westminster Assembly]], and annotated for them the books of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] and [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]].

He disapproved of the introduction of the Covenant and declared himself in favour of [[episcopacy]]. He was one of the forty-seven London clergymen who disapproved of the trial of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].

He engaged in a public controversy with the astrologer [[William Lilly]], who had mentioned Gataker in an [[almanac]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=45390, which has some further biographical details.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Works==

His principal works, besides some volumes of sermons, are:
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Of the Nature and Use of Lots&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1619), a curious treatise which led to his being accused of favouring games of chance, but which Boswell called &amp;quot;a learned book of the age&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;James Boswell (Henry Morley, ed), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D. and The Journal of his tour to the Hebrides&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [Joshua Reynolds Edition], Vol V, Routledge, 1885, p. 228&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The second edition in 1627 contained a refutation of [[James Balmford]]&amp;apos;s criticism. It was edited and republished in 2008 as  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Nature and Uses of Lotteries&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1845401174; discussion in J. Franklin, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), 284-5.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Conall Boyle (ed.)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.conallboyle.com/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Imprint Academic.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.imprint.co.uk/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dissertatio de stylo Novi Testamenti&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1648)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cinnus, sive Adversaria miscellanea, in quibus Sacrae Scripturae primo, deinde aliorum scriptorum, locis aliquam multis lux redditur&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1651), to which was afterwards subjoined &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Adversaria Posthuma&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
*an edition of [[Marcus Antoninus]] (1652)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;According to Hallam, is the &amp;quot;earliest edition of any classical writer published in England with original annotations,&amp;quot; and, for the period at which it was written, possesses remarkable merit.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

His collected works were published in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] in 1698.
