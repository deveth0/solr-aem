&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Atlas of Middle-earth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] is an [[atlas (cartography)|atlas]] of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]&amp;apos;s [[fiction]]al realm of [[Middle-earth]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eHAyr784pREC&amp;amp;pg=PA42 |title=The Essential J. R. R. Tolkien Sourcebook |author=George Beahm}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was published in 1981, after Tolkien&amp;apos;s major works &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Hobbit]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Lord of the Rings]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Silmarillion]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Atlas&amp;apos;&amp;apos; includes many detailed maps of the lands described in those books. There was a revised and updated second edition in 1991, after publication of eight volumes in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The History of Middle-earth]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]] after his father&amp;apos;s death. Four volumes of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The History&amp;apos;&amp;apos; followed it, however.

The maps are treated as if they are of real landscapes, drawn according to the rules of a real atlas. For each area the history of the land is taken into account, as well as geography on a larger scale and from there maps are drawn. Discussion includes suggestions as to the geology that could explain various formations, and points that are contradictory between multiple accounts.

[[City map]]s and floor plans for important buildings are also included.

Karen Wynn Fonstad had earned a Master&amp;apos;s degree in Geography, specializing in [[cartography]], from the [[University of Oklahoma]], and worked as Director of Cartographic Services at the [[University of Wisconsinâ€“Oshkosh]] before &amp;quot;retirement&amp;quot; to raising children and writing atlases of fictional worlds.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;About the Author&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Atlas of Pern]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, New York: Del Rey Books, 1984. Back endpapers.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Atlas of Middle-earth&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was her first of five atlases. (Her 1984 acknowledgments for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Atlas of Pern&amp;apos;&amp;apos; would include &amp;quot;my husband, Todd, associate professor of geography&amp;quot;, the UW Oshkosh Department of Geography, several UWO faculty members.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Acknowledgements&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Atlas of Pern&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Front endpapers.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;)
