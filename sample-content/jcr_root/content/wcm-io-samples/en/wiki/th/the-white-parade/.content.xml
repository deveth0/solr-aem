&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The White Parade&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 1934 film that was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].  It was written by [[Rian James]], [[Jesse Lasky Jr.]], [[Sonya Levien]] and Ernest Pascal, from the novel by Rian James.  The film was directed by [[Irving Cummings]].

Dedicated to &amp;quot;the memory of Florence Nightingale&amp;quot;, the plot concerns the travails and romances of young women as they study to become nurses.  It stars [[Loretta Young]] and [[John Boles (actor)|John Boles]].

The only surviving print is located at the UCLA film archive, and can be viewed at the Instructional Media Lab, Powell Library, after making an appointment.

The print is in rough shape; several frames are out of alignment, at times, while the whole picture looks bleached out and very fuzzy. As well, near the end of the film, a sign pops up indicating &amp;quot;reel 7&amp;quot;; fast forward and you can see the rest of the film.

This is one of two Best Picture nominees that have never been released on home video. The other is [[East Lynne (1931 film)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;East Lynne&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1931 film)]].
