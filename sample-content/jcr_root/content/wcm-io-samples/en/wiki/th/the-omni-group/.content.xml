&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Omni Group&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a company that develops software for the [[Mac OS X]] platform.  The Omni Group was informally founded as a [[NEXTSTEP]] consulting company in 1989 by [[Wil Shipley]], who immediately brought on [[Ken Case (Business)|Ken Case]] and Tim Wood. The three incorporated together under the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Omni Development, Inc.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1993, because the name &amp;quot;Omni Group&amp;quot; was taken by another Seattle firm.  Omni initially produced custom database software for the NEXTSTEP platform for clients such as the [[William Morris Agency]] and [[McCaw Cellular Communications]] (then [[Cingular Wireless]]; now [[AT&amp;amp;T Inc.]]).  During this period they also ported a number of games to NEXTSTEP, then later to Mac OS X (after Apple acquired NeXT in 1997). Around 2000 the company decided to start focusing on their own consumer applications for the Mac, and as of 2004 the vast majority of their revenue came from their consumer products. In 2003 Ken Case took over as the chief officer of Omni, and in March 2004 Wil Shipley left with another Omni employee, interface designer [[Mike Matas]], to form [[Delicious Monster]]. Matas later left for Apple.

The Omni Group also administers several [[mailing list]]s related to Mac OS X and software development. They also provide several frameworks for [[Cocoa (software)|Cocoa]] software development under an [[open source]] license.

[[OmniGraffle]] and [[OmniOutliner]] have won [[Macworld]] Editors&amp;apos; Choice Awards. At the Macintosh [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] in 2001, OmniWeb 4.0 won two [[Apple Design Awards]]: &amp;quot;Best Mac OS X User Experience&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Best New Mac OS X Product.&amp;quot; In 2002 OmniGraffle 2.0 won two more Apple Design Awards.
