&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Merton Parkas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were a [[mod revival]] [[band (music)|band]], formed in the [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]] area of [[South London]] in the mid-1970s, by Danny Talbot ([[singing|vocals]] and [[guitar]]), his [[sibling|brother]], [[Mick Talbot]] ([[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), Neil Hurrell ([[bass guitar|bass]]) and Simon Smith ([[drum]]s).

They signed with the [[indie music|independent]] [[record label]], [[Beggars Banquet Records|Beggars Banquet]]. They were discovered playing in a pub in Clapham, South London by Alan Anger,punk journalist. Their name at first was The Sneekers and they were a part of the Powerpop bands that included The Pleasers. The Merton Parkas released a few moderately successful [[single (music)|singles]], such as: &amp;quot;You Need Wheels&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Plastic Smile&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Give it to Me Now&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Put Me in the Picture&amp;quot;. They also released one [[album]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Face in the Crowd&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  [[Rick Buckler]] of [[The Jam]] played with the band at [[Ronnie Scotts]] and Mick Talbot appeared on an album by The Jam.  He played on Heatwave. After the group disbanded in 1980, Mick Talbot went on to play with [[Dexys Midnight Runners]], [[The Bureau]], and [[The Style Council]]. Simon Smith went on to join psychedelic revival band, Mood Six.

The Merton Parkas&amp;apos; most notable [[song|track]] was &amp;quot;You Need Wheels&amp;quot;, which reached #40 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in the summer of 1979.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;British Hit Singles &amp;amp; Albums&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book
