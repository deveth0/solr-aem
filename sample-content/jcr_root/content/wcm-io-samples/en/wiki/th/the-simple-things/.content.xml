Released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] on April 18, 1953, the short is notable as the final regular entry in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mickey Mouse&amp;apos;&amp;apos; theatrical cartoon series. Following this short, one-shot Mickey shorts were produced: the featurettes &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Mickey&amp;apos;s Christmas Carol]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1983) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Prince and the Pauper (1990 film)|The Prince and the Pauper]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1990),  and the shorts &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Runaway Brain]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1995), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Get a Horse!]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2013).

==Plot==
At the start of the cartoon, [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] is seen whistling to the tune of the song &amp;quot;The Simple Things,&amp;quot; [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]] sniffing behind him, spots a [[mussel]] as he tries to cover up miniature [[geysers]] along the way.  The mussel then squirts water at him.  Pluto barks at the mussel and the mussel barks back.  The mussel gets trapped on Pluto&#x60;s tail after they fight.  He pulls the mussel up and attempts to shove it off his tail but instead he pulls the mussel up and down like a [[Yo-Yo|yo-yo]].  The mussel accidentally gets stuck in his [[mouth]].  Pluto then rushes to Mickey for assistance.  At first Mickey thinks that Pluto is asking for food and feeds him a [[hot dog]].  The mussel then steals Mickey&amp;apos;s sandwich and a full pepper shaker which causes the mussel to sneeze thus freeing itself from Pluto&amp;apos;s mouth.  The mussel bounces around sneezing and wakes up a [[pelican]] that decides to eat the mussel.  The sneezing mussel escapes the pelican by entering the sea.  The hungry pelican steals the hotdog that Mickey is feeding Pluto instead.  The pelican then sets his sights on the fish bait Mickey is using and unsuccessfully attempts to steal the fish while the line is being cast.  Dejected but determined, the pelican then sits on top of Mickey&amp;apos;s hat and easily steals the fish as he is baiting the hook until Mickey shoos the pelican away.  He then floats under the hat to the other bait bucket and again eats the fish until Pluto notices and shoos him away.  The pelican by tying up Pluto using his own tail and ears.  Mickey again catches the pelican in his bait and after the bird tries to fly away carrying the bait, Mickey throws a rock in it which weighs it down.  To overcome this, the pelican spells out &amp;quot;FREE FRESH FISH&amp;quot; using [[flag semaphore]] to get the other pelicans to chase Mickey and Pluto away.  The short ends with the pelican floating away with fish in his mouth singing the song &amp;quot;The Simple Things&amp;quot;.
