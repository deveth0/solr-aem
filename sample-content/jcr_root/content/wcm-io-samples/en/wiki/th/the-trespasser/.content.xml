&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Trespasser&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 1929 American film directed and written by [[Edmund Goulding]], starring [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Robert Ames]], [[Purnell Pratt]], [[Henry B. Walthall]], and [[Wally Albright]]. The film was released by [[United Artists]] in both [[silent film|silent]] and [[talkie]] versions.

==Plot==
A humble woman (Swanson) marries a wealthy man (Ames). Their marriage is annulled by the man&amp;apos;s father (Holden), who considers her a fortune-hunter, and she is left alone to raise her child. She later becomes a &amp;quot;kept woman&amp;quot; for an older, married man.  When the man dies, leaving Swanson a $500,000 inheritance, the press is quick to cast doubts upon the paternity of Swanson&amp;apos;s child.  Her ex-husband has since remarried, and now comes back into Swanson&amp;apos;s life.  For the sake of her child, she sends the boy to live with her ex and his wife.  The wife dies and the film ends happily (if improbably) with Swanson reunited with her ex-husband.

==Production background==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Trespasser&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was produced as both a silent and sound version for a total negative cost of $725,000.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Beauchamp, Cari. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Joseph P. Kennedy Presents: His Hollywood Years&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Random House Digital. p 265. Accessed May 22. 2012&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The film earned an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for (Gloria Swanson) in her [[talkie]] debut. It was written and directed by Edmund Goulding and was first filmed as a [[silent film]]. A talkie version was quickly made and was a smash hit for its star, Gloria Swanson. Goulding [[remake|remade]] the film as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[That Certain Woman]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1937) with [[Bette Davis]] and [[Henry Fonda]].

==Preservation status==
[[George Eastman House]] preserved the film with the help of the [[American Film Institute]] and [[The Film Foundation]]. This restored version was shown on [[Turner Classic Movies]] on December 14, 2011.

==Legacy==
Sadly for Swanson, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Trespasser&amp;apos;&amp;apos; proved to be one of her only two hit talkies, the other being &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sunset Boulevard&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1950), over 20 years later. Subsequent films like &amp;apos;&amp;apos;What a Widow!&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1930), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Indiscreet (1931 film)|Indiscreet]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1931), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Tonight or Never (1931 film)|Tonight or Never]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1931), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Perfect Understanding]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1933), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Music in the Air]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1934) all proved to be box-office flops.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Trespasser&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an important film for Swanson, following the disastrous &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Queen Kelly]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1929) and the hit &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sadie Thompson]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1928). This was Swanson&amp;apos;s second Oscar nomination. Despite the disappointments following &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Trespasser,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Swanson was remembered by [[Billy Wilder]], a writer on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Music in the Air&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, when he was casting the part of [[Norma Desmond]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1950).
