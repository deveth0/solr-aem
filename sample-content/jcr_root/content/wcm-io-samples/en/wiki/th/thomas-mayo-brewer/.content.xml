&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thomas Mayo Brewer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (November 21, 1814 &amp;amp;ndash; January 24, 1880) was an [[United States|American]] [[natural history|naturalist]].

Mayo is best known as the joint author, with [[Spencer Fullerton Baird|Baird]] and [[Robert Ridgway|Ridgway]], of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A History of North American Birds&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (3 volumes, 1874), which was the first attempt since [[John James Audubon]]&amp;apos;s (thirty years prior) to complete the study of American [[ornithology]].

Brewer was born in [[Boston]]. He graduated from [[Harvard College]] in 1835 and from [[Harvard Medical School]] three years later. He abandoned his career as a doctor after a few years to concentrate on writing and politics, later becoming editor of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Boston Atlas]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He then joined the printing firm of Swan &amp;amp; Tileston, which became Brewer &amp;amp; Tileston when he became a partner in 1857.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Brewer, Wilmon, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Looking Backwards,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Marshall Jones Company, Francestown, NH, 1985&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Brewer spent his spare time contributing to a number of ornithological publications, including [[John James Audubon]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ornithological Biography.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  Brewer was a companion to Audubon, who gave Brewer&amp;apos;s name to a duck, a blackbird and a rodent (Brewer&amp;apos;s shrew mole) found on Martha&amp;apos;s vineyard.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Milne, John, &amp;quot;Once-notable family has its history sold to the highest bidder,&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boston Globe,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Metro section, p. 16, May 29, 1995, Boston, MA.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The Brewer family has been prominent in Massachusetts for 200 years, including James Brewer (1742–1806), an early American patriot leader and businessman, [[List of American Civil War Medal of Honor recipients: A–F|Gen. Wilmon Blackmar]], a Civil War medal of honor winner, and [[Wilmon Brewer]], a poet, biographer, and philanthropist.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Milne, John, &amp;quot;Once-notable family has its history sold to the highest bidder,&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boston Globe,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Metro section, p. 16, May 29, 1995, Boston, MA.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
