&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Memory of Whiteness&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[science fiction]] [[novel]] written by [[Kim Stanley Robinson]] and published in 1985.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=NZak7Hk5zTQC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=The+Memory+of+Whiteness&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=dEQtF4pj6L&amp;amp;sig=orPA-LAo-J3DveDLy0_N0EvhkGk&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=NcAQTamwCI-p8Abt8dnVDQ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=3&amp;amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false Google Books image of copyright page]. Retrieved 21 December 2010.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It shares with the [[Mars trilogy]] a focus on human colonization of the [[solar system]] and depicts a grand tour that travels from the outer [[planet]]s inward toward the [[Sun]], visiting many human colonies along the way. The different human [[society|societies]] on the various [[planet]]s and [[planetoid]]s visited are depicted in detail. The purpose of the tour is to stage concerts by the &amp;apos;Holywelkin Orchestra&amp;apos;, a futuristic musical instrument played by a selected master.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Heck, Peter J., [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/99969463.html?dids=99969463:99969463&amp;amp;FMT=ABS&amp;amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;amp;type=current&amp;amp;date=Feb+23%2C+1986&amp;amp;author=By+Peter+J.+Heck&amp;amp;pub=Newsday+%28Combined+editions%29&amp;amp;desc=SCIENCE+FICTION+%2F+Gazing+at+the+Stars+of+Tomorrow&amp;amp;pqatl=google &amp;quot;Science Fiction: Gazing at the Stars of Tomorrow]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Newsday]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 23 February 1986. Retrieved 21 December 2010.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Readers follow the Orchestra and its entourage together with a journalist, who after some time detects a conspiracy that seems to be connected with a group of gray-clad, sun-worshipping monks. The tour ends near the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] in a solar station belonging to these &amp;quot;Grays&amp;quot;, which controls the white line energy source for the whole solar system.

==Themes==
In comparison to Robinson&amp;apos;s later works, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Memory of Whiteness&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is less like [[hard science fiction]] and more about [[art]], especially [[music]] and the emotions triggered by it. One of the central themes of the book is a discussion of the extent to which human free will exists in the universe. The main character struggles to understand a kind of [[determinism]] which he discovers through his music-related physics work. Also, a secret cult who perform &amp;quot;meta-dramas&amp;quot; is the object of a debate between how much one&amp;apos;s actions are the result of manipulations by others. Both these contribute to an underlying theme of questioning human free will, and exploring the implications of a deterministic philosophy towards human behavior.
