        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;UCCEL Corp&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, previously called University Computing Company (&amp;quot;UCC&amp;quot;), was a [[data processing]] [[service bureau]] on the campus of [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Dallas, Texas]].&amp;lt;ref name=interview&amp;gt;[http://www.cbi.umn.edu/oh/pdf.phtml?id=334 An Interview with SAM WYLY]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was founded by the Wyly brothers (Sam and Charles, Jr.) in 1963.&amp;lt;ref name=interview /&amp;gt; The name change in the mid-1980s was brought about by Gregory Liemandt, placed as [[CEO]] by the majority [[stockholder]], a Swiss citizen named [[Walter Haefner]] through Careal Holding AG of [[Zurich]].

Uccel&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;big-ticket item&amp;quot; claim to fame was software called UCC-1/TMS ([[Tape Management System]]), an [[IBM mainframe]] product for managing the [[tape library]] in an [[OS/MVS]] [[operating system]] environment.  In 1980, they developed their second &amp;quot;big hitter&amp;quot; and most profitable product, UCC-7 ([[job scheduler]]).  The UCC-1, UCC-7, UCC-11 suite led the market for tape management and job scheduling.

In 1986, UCCEL Corporation purchased Cambridge Systems Group, Inc., which marketed for SKK, Inc. and their [[ACF2]] mainframe security product.  In June &amp;apos;87, Uccel was unexpectedly bought out by its archrival, [[Computer Associates]], which aggressively sold directly competing products CA-Dynam/TLMS (tape management), CA-Scheduler and [[batch job]] scheduling products originally from [[Capex Corporation]] and Value Software, plus CA-Top Secret (security / mainframe [[discretionary access control]]).
