&amp;lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Ucheldre_Centre.jpg|thumb|The Ucheldre Centre]] --&amp;gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ucheldre Centre&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[arts centre]] located in [[Holyhead]], [[Isle of Anglesey|Anglesey]], [[Wales]].
==Architecture==
Formerly, it was the chapel building of Holyhead&amp;apos;s [[Bon Sauveur]] [[Christian monasticism|order of nuns]] convent. The main hall of the Centre, with its imposing height and arched roof, was designed by Professor R M Butler, of [[Dublin]], a leading architect of his day, responsible for many public buildings in Ireland. The building is in a modernized Romanesque style, with a tall square tower, making great use of green local stone. It was saved from demolition in 1998 by a group of local residents to be used in its current guise.
==Community Centre==
The Ucheldre Centre is a community effort to provide those who live in and visit Holyhead, and nearby parts of north-west [[Wales]], with a centre for arts events, exhibitions, and other community activities of an educational and cultural kind. Before its inauguration, Holyhead had no venue for such events. As a performance space, it seats up to 200. Extensions have been added at the back and sides, to provide room for a gallery, restaurant, and other facilities. The grounds have been landscaped, and contain an [[amphitheatre]] for theatrical events, and sculptures by local artists. The main hall also doubles up as a [[movie theater|cinema]], showing mainstream and less well-known films, on the Centre&amp;apos;s film nights.
==Famous Visitors==
The Centre has regular exhibitions that have included art by such artists as [[Kyffin Williams]]. It has also received the [[Prince of Wales]] Award, amongst other honours.
