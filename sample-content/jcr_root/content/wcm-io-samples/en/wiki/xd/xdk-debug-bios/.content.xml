The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;XDK Debug BIOS&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is an alternate [[BIOS]] created by [[Microsoft]] for [[Xbox]] gaming system. It is included in Debug [[Xbox]] consoles that are used by game software developers.  It differs from a Retail [[BIOS]] by allowing the [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox Development Kit|XDK]] to link with the Xbox while it is executing code and receive feedback.  It also allows for the running of code not digitally signed by [[Microsoft]], similar to a hacked Retail [[BIOS]], since finalized code must be submitted to [[Microsoft]] for a key to run on unmodified Retail consoles.

The debug and retail BIOSes do not differ much, and as a result hackers have been able to create hacked debug BIOSes which can be run on any retail Xbox. Thus, any Xbox can be converted into a Development Xbox. By further studying the debug BIOS, hackers have gained the ability to modify any Xbox BIOS in a way which allows them to load it from the internal hard disk, and then boot it &amp;apos;on the fly&amp;apos;.
This hack has been of great significance to the Xbox community.
