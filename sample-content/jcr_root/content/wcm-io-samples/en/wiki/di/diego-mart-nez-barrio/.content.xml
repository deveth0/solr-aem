[[File:Diego Martínez Barrio.JPG|thumb|Diego Martínez Barrio]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Diego Martínez y Barrio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (25 November 1883, [[Seville]] &amp;amp;ndash; 1 January 1962) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] politician during the [[Second Spanish Republic]], [[Prime Minister of Spain]] between 9 October 1933 and 26 December 1933&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.geneall.net/H/per_page.php?id=467700&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and was briefly appointed again by [[Manuel Azaña]] after the resignation of [[Santiago Casares Quiroga]], on July 19, 1936 - three days after the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. From March 16, 1936 to March 30, 1939 Martínez was President of the Cortes. In 1936, he briefly was interim President of the Second Spanish Republic from 7 April to 10 of May.

Barrio was born in [[Seville]].  A member of the [[Radical Republican Party]], he was the Minister in the [[Alejandro Lerroux]] government, although later he left the party due to his dissatisfaction with the politics of Lerroux.

Martínez consequently founded and led the [[Republican Union Party]] and participated in the [[Spanish Popular Front]], being elected to government in 1936. He led the integration of the Republican Union Party into the Popular Front, being elected the speaker of the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] (Spanish Parliament). He fled the country after [[Francisco Franco]] came to power in 1939.

He was the Grand Master of the [[Grande Oriente Español]] from 1929 to 1934.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.gle.org/ingles/i_historia.php#III 1863-1923], Brief History of the Spanish Masonry&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

After the fall of the Republic he went into exile, first to [[France]] and then to [[Mexico]] where in 1945 he was designated  [[President_of_Spain#Presidents_of_the_Republic_2|president]] of the [[Spanish Republican government in Exile|Republic in exile]] until 1962. Martínez finally returned to [[Paris]], where he died.

In 2000, his remains were moved to [[Seville]].
