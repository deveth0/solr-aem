The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;disk controller&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] which enables the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] to communicate with a [[hard disk]], [[floppy disk]] or other kind of [[disk drive]].

Early disk controllers were identified by their storage methods and data encoding.  They were typically implemented on a separate controller card. [[Modified frequency modulation]] (MFM) controllers were the most common type in small computers, used for both floppy disk and hard disk drives. [[Run length limited]] (RLL) controllers used data compression to increase storage capacity by about 50%.  Priam created a proprietary storage algorithm that could double the disk storage.  [[Shugart Associates]] Systems Interface ([[Shugart Associates System Interface|SASI]]) was a predecessor to [[SCSI]].

Modern disk controllers are integrated into the disk drive. For example, disks called &amp;quot;SCSI disks&amp;quot; have built-in SCSI controllers. In the past, before most SCSI controller functionality was implemented in a single chip, separate SCSI controllers interfaced disks to the SCSI bus.

The most common types of interfaces provided nowadays by disk controllers are [[Parallel ATA|PATA (IDE)]] and [[Serial ATA]] for home use. High-end disks use [[SCSI]], [[Fibre Channel]] or [[Serial Attached SCSI]].  Disk controllers can also control the timing of access to [[flash memory]] which is mechless in nature (i.e. no physical disk).

==Disk controller versus host adapter==
The correct term for the components that allows a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;computer&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to talk to a peripheral bus is [[host adapter]] or host bus adapter (HBA). On the other hand, a disk controller allows a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;disk&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to talk to the same bus. Those two are often confused, especially in the [[Advanced Technology Attachment|PC world]]. In fact signals read by a [[disk read-and-write head]] are converted by a disk controller, then transmitted over the peripheral bus, then converted again by the host adapter into the suitable format for the [[motherboard]]&amp;apos;s bus, and then read by the [[CPU]].

Sometimes there may be yet another controller between a host adapter and a disk controller - a [[disk array controller]] that allows [[RAID#Hardware RAID|hardware RAID]] to be formed. Sometimes it may be even physically integrated with an HBA, but it performs different functions.
