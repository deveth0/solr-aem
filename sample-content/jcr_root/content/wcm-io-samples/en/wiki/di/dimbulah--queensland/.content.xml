&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dimbulah&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a town located in [[Far North Queensland|Far North]] [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], 114 kilometres from [[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]] by road, on the [[Atherton Tableland]].  The town was established in 1876 to service the Tyrconnell Gold Mine, one of the richest mines on the Hodgkinson Gold Fields. The name &amp;quot;Dimbulah&amp;quot; is thought to have come from the local [[Indigenous Australian]] word for &amp;quot;long waterhole&amp;quot;, referring to the Walsh River that runs nearby the town. At the 2006 [[Census in Australia|census]], Dimbulah had a population of 381.&amp;lt;ref name=Census2006Y&amp;gt;{{Census 2006 AUS|id=UCL317400|name=Dimbulah (L) (Urban Centre/Locality) |accessdate=7 May 2011|quick=on}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The area around Dimbulah was originally home to the Djankun&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Tindale&amp;apos;s Catalogue of Australian Aboriginal Tribes|url=http://archives.samuseum.sa.gov.au/tindaletribes/djankun.htm|work=South Australia Museum Archives|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  and [[Kuku Yulanji|Kuku Djungan]] tribe. During the 1920s the Queensland government forcibly [[Stolen generation|removed]] most of their children, forcing the tribe to scatter.

In the early 1900s the area received an influx of [[Italy|Italian]] migrants and in 1928 [[tobacco]] was introduced, becoming the area&amp;apos;s major industry soon after.  At its peak, there were 800 growers in the area, producing over 8,000 [[tonne]]s (60% of national yield) of tobacco a year.

Tobacco remained the dominant crop until recent years when government policy compelled its demise.  Recent attempts at alternative crops such as [[Melaleuca|tea tree]]s, [[mango]]es, [[sugar cane]], [[coffee]], lemons, limes, avocados, papaws, papayas, peanuts, soya beans, lychees, and cash crops ([[pumpkin]]s, [[melon]]s, etc.) have met with mixed success.

Local residents enjoy a tropical climate with hot, wet summers and dry, mild winters.  There are many sporting clubs including swimming, tennis, horse and pony, lawn bowls, [[Rhee Taekwon-Do]], and soccer.  At the time of writing{{When|date=February 2011}}, the town&amp;apos;s retail facilities include a bank, post office, chemist, cafe, therapeutic massage,  real estate, opp shop, butcher, two salons, clothing store, hardware store, community bank, grocery store, convenience store and petrol station.  Community groups include the Dimbulah Community Centre, Lions Club, QCWA, chamber of commerce, museum association,Library, Friulani, Trevisani, and several faith-based groups.
