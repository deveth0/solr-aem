&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dildo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a town on the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], in the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Canada]]. It is located on the southeastern Dildo Arm of [[Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trinity Bay]] about 60 kilometres west of [[St. John&amp;apos;s, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John&amp;apos;s]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;South Dildo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a neighbouring unincorporated community. The town&amp;apos;s unusual name has brought it a certain amount of notoriety in the same vein as [[Fucking, Austria]]; [[Anus, France]]; [[Nob End|Nob End, England]]; [[Effin|Effin, Ireland]]; [[Twatt, Orkney|Twatt, Scotland]]; [[Bald Knob|Bald Knob, Arkansas]]; and [[Wankum|Wankum, Germany]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.masalatime.com/?p=831&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web

==Name==
The place name &amp;quot;Dildo&amp;quot; is attested in this area since at least 1711, though how this came to be is unknown. The origin of the word &amp;quot;[[dildo]]&amp;quot; itself is obscure. It was once used to reference a phallus-shaped pin stuck in the edging of a row boat to act as a pivot for the oar (also known as a &amp;quot;thole pin&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;dole pin.&amp;quot;)&amp;lt;ref name=Dictionary of Newfoundland and Labrador&amp;gt;Dictionary of Newfoundland and Labrador&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was used as early as the 16th century for a cylindrical object such as a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;dildo glass&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[test tube]]), for a [[phallus]]-shaped sex toy, as an insult for a &amp;quot;contemptuous or reviling&amp;quot; male, and as a refrain in ballads.&amp;lt;ref name=OED&amp;gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1989|month= June|title= Dildo (1.)|journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |volume= |issue= |pages=  |url= http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50064101?query_type=word&amp;amp;queryword=dildo&amp;amp;first=1&amp;amp;max_to_show=10&amp;amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;amp;search_id=KRMF-rQ3YjR-3884&amp;amp;result_place=1|accessdate=October 6, 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The name, then written as &amp;quot;Dildoe&amp;quot;, was first applied to [[Dildo Island]], located offshore from the present-day town of Dildo. This use was recorded in 1711 and 1775, and the name was thereafter applied to the Dildo Arm of [[Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trinity Bay]] and other local physical features. Social scientist William Baillie Hamilton notes that Captain [[James Cook]] and his assistant Michael Lane, who mapped Newfoundland in the 1760s, often displayed a sense of humour in the place names they chose, and were not above selecting names that might offend overly sensitive readers. Regardless of the origin, the name has brought the town of Dildo a measure of notoriety. In the 20th century there were several campaigns to change the name, though all failed.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title= Place Names of Atlantic Canada|last= Hamilton|first= William Baillie|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1996|publisher= University of Toronto Press|location= |isbn= 0-8020-7570-3|page= |pages= |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=UAvyE0pN5akC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;cad=0|accessdate=October 6, 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
The Dildo area has a long history, going as far back as 2000 BC when [[Maritime Archaic]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|aboriginal people]] resided at [[Anderson&amp;apos;s Cove]]. By 700 AD, people of the [[Dorset culture]] inhabited [[Dildo Island]]. In 1613, [[Henry Crout]], whilst sailing up Dildo Arm, came in contact with the [[Beothuk]]s, who were residing on Dildo Island at this time. He traded with them and left gifts. In 1711 the inhabitants of [[Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trinity Bay]] were ordered by [[Governor Crow]] to leave their homes during the winter, to defend themselves against the [[France|French]], who burned their houses. Dildo Island was one of the places designated for this purpose. The town of Dildo was founded in the late 18th century and settled to exploit the abundance of marine resources such as [[fish]] (mostly cod), [[whale]]s and [[Pinniped|seal]]s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web
