        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dictabelt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Morton|first=David|title=Off the Record: The Technology and Culture of Sound Recording in America|year=2000|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-2747-3}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Memobelt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a form of recording medium introduced by the [[United States|American]] [[Dictaphone]] company in 1947. It used a type of &amp;quot;Write Once -  Read Many&amp;quot; medium consisting of a thin, plastic belt 3.5&amp;quot; wide&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;audio_history&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.videointerchange.com/audio_history.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; that was placed on a cylinder and rotated like a [[tank tread]]. It was inscribed with a spiral groove by the needle, which itself made a slow lateral movement across the belt. Unlike a record cutter, the audio on a Dictabelt is imprinted (pressed in) rather than cut.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;audio_history&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; The recordings had better fidelity than the wax cylinders they replaced. The belts could be folded and placed in envelopes. However, if they were stored too long in a folded state, the folds would become permanent.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.poppyrecords.co.uk/other/Dictabelts/dictabelts.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;audio_history&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  In the 1960s, [[Virginia]] required that all of its circuit courts be outfitted with Dictabelt machines.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.dictabeltrerecord.com/about.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The belts first came in red, then blue, and finally purple. &amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;audio_history&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Along with a [[Gray Audograph]] sound recorder, a Dictabelt recorded the police department radio channels in Dallas, Texas during the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]].
These recordings were reviewed by the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]].
