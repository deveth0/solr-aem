The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;disease model of addiction&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; describes an [[Substance dependence|addiction]] as a [[disease]] with biological, neurological, genetic, and environmental sources of origin.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://archives.drugabuse.gov/about/welcome/aboutdrugabuse/chronicdisease/ McLellan et al., &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Addiction is a Chronic Brain Disease&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2000). Archived at the National Institute on Drug Abuse website.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The traditional [[medical model]] of [[disease]] requires only that an abnormal condition be present that causes discomfort, dysfunction, or distress to the individual afflicted. The contemporary medical model attributes addiction, in part, to changes in the [[Human brain|brain]]&amp;apos;s [[mesolimbic pathway]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/278/5335/45 Leshner, Alan I., &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Addiction Is a Brain Disease, and It Matters&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Science 3 October 1997: Vol. 278. no. 5335, pp. 45 - 47]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The [[medical model]] also takes into consideration that such disease may be the result of other biologic, psychologic, or sociologic entities despite an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of these entities.

According to the disease model, the onset and development of addiction are influenced though [[genetic predisposition]] and environmental factors. These hypotheses would explain the result of adoption and [[twin studies]] that have been carried out, indicating that twins separated at birth have a higher likelihood of concordance for addictive disease than would be expected were there not a genetic component, and indicating that these twins have a lower likelihood of concordance for addictive disease than do twins who remain together in identical environments.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Prescott&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Prescott, Carol A., and Kendler, Kenneth S.  (January, 1999).

==Criticism==
Critics of the disease model, particularly those who subscribe to the [[life-process model of addiction]] argue that labeling people as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;addicts&amp;apos;&amp;apos; keeps them from developing self-control and [[social stigma|stigmatizes]] them.  As noted by [[harm reduction]] specialist Andrew Tatarsky:
{{cquote|The essence of this model is the pragmatic recognition that treatment must meet active substance users ‘‘where they are’’ in terms of their needs and personal goals. Thus, harm reduction approaches embrace the full range of harm-reducing goals including, but not limited to, abstinence.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|last=Tatarsky|first=Andrew|title=Harm reduction psychotherapy: Extending the reach of traditional substance use treatment|journal=Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment|date=24|year=2003|month=April|volume=25|pages=249–256|url=http://www.harmreduction.org/downloads/Harm%20Reduction%20Psychotherapy:%20Extending%20the%20Reach%20of%20Traditional%20Substance%20Use%20Treatment.pdf|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;}}
