==History==

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Die Trying&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a four member [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 2001 and based in [[Sacramento, California]].

After signing a contract with [[Island Records]] in 2002, they released their first single, &amp;quot;Oxygen&amp;apos;s Gone&amp;quot;, followed by their [[Die Trying (album)|self-titled debut album]] on June 10, 2003. [[Jacoby Shaddix]] of [[Papa Roach]] appears on the song &amp;quot;Conquer The World&amp;quot; from that album.

The bands name comes from their relentless effort in trying to make it and willingness to do anything. They would either make it or &amp;quot;Die Trying.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Die Trying&amp;quot; (produced by Neal Avron) reached critical success having been on the Billboard Top Heatseeker Albums for 10 weeks with a peak position at No.&amp;amp;nbsp;14.

The lead single &amp;quot;Oxygen&amp;apos;s Gone&amp;quot; received heavy video airplay on MTV, MTV2, and Fuse. It also was able to land spots on Billboard&amp;apos;s Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks for 8 weeks with a peak position of No.&amp;amp;nbsp;35, along with Billboard&amp;apos;s Modern Rock Tracks for 6 weeks with a peak position of No.&amp;amp;nbsp;29

Die Trying disbanded thanks to what the band states as &amp;quot;shitty management, drugs, lawsuits, band drama, and all kinds of bad luck&amp;quot; in 2004.

August 10, 2007 Die Trying played a show at The Boardwalk in Orangvale, CA along with Another Damn Disappointment.

On November 2, 2007 Die Trying played a show at The Boardwalk in Orangvale, CA.

Though unverified, it can be inferred that Die Trying has broken up. There have been zero updates to the band&amp;apos;s official MySpace in over a year.

Joey Cunha (known by the stage name Joey Roxx) has gone on to join the hard rock band [[Burn Halo]], which is fronted by former-[[Eighteen Visions]] frontman [[James Stephen Hart|James Hart]].
