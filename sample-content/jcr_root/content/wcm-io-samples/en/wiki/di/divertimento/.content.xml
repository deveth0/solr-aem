&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Divertimento&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPAc-en|d|ɨ|ˌ|v|ɜr|t|ɨ|ˈ|m|ɛ|n|t|oʊ}}; from the [[Italian language|Italian]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;divertire&amp;apos;&amp;apos; — to amuse) is a musical genre, with most of its examples from the 18th century. The mood of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;divertimento&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is most often lighthearted (as a result of being played at social functions) and it is generally composed for a small [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]].

Divertimento is used to describe a wide variety of secular instrumental works for soloist or chamber ensemble. It is a kind of music entertainment although it could also be applied to serious genres. After 1780, the term generally designated works that were informal or light.

As a separate genre, it appears to have no specific form, although most of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;divertimenti&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the second half of the 18th century go either back to a dance [[Suite (music)|suite]] approach (derived from the &amp;apos;ballet&amp;apos; type of theatrical &amp;apos;&amp;apos;divertimento&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), or take the form of other [[chamber music]] genres of their century (as a continuation of the merely instrumental theatrical &amp;apos;&amp;apos;divertimento&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). There are many other terms which describe music similar to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;divertimento&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[serenade]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[cassation (music)|cassation]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;notturno&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nachtmusik&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; after about 1780, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;divertimento&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the term most commonly applied to this light, &amp;quot;after-dinner&amp;quot; and often outdoor music.  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Divertimenti&amp;apos;&amp;apos; have from one to nine movements, and there is at least one example with thirteen. The earliest publication to use the name &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;divertimento&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; is by [[Carlo Grossi]], in 1681, in [[Venice]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Il divertimento de&amp;apos; grandi: musiche da camera, ò per servizio di tavola&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) --and the hint that the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;divertimento&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is to accompany &amp;quot;table service&amp;quot; applies to later ages as well, since this light music was often used to accompany banquets and other social events.

[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] is known for having composed different types of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;divertimenti&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, sometimes even taking the form of a small [[symphony]] (or, more exactly: [[sinfonia]]), for example, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Salzburg Symphonies&amp;apos;&amp;apos; KV 136-137-138. Even more unusual is his six movement string trio, [[Trio for Violin, Viola &amp;amp; Cello in E flat major, K. 563 (Mozart)|KV 563]], which is a serious work belonging with his string quartets and quintets, for all that it is labeled a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;divertimento&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Other composers of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;divertimenti&amp;apos;&amp;apos; include [[Leopold Mozart]], [[Carl Stamitz]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Luigi Boccherini|Boccherini]].

Several examples exist from the 20th century, including works by [[Alfred Reed]], [[Nikolai Medtner]], [[Ferruccio Busoni]], [[Vincent Persichetti]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Béla Bartók]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Gordon Jacob]], [[Lennox Berkeley]], [[Gareth Walters]], [[Malcolm Arnold]], [[Lars-Erik Larsson]] and [[Bohuslav Martinů]]. [[Igor Stravinsky]] also arranged a divertimento from his ballet to music of Tchaikovsky, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Le baiser de la fée]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, while [[Joaquín Rodrigo]] called his 1982 [[cello concerto]] a &amp;quot;[[Concierto como un divertimento]]&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Concerto like a divertimento&amp;quot;).
