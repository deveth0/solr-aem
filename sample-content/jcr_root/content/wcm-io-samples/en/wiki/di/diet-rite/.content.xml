&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Diet Rite&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a brand of no-calorie [[soft drinks]] originally distributed by the [[RC Cola]] company. It was introduced in 1958 and initially released as a [[dietetic]] product, but was introduced nationwide and marketed to the general public as a healthful beverage in 1962. The original formula was sweetened with [[cyclamate]] and [[saccharin]].&amp;lt;ref name=diet&amp;gt;[http://www.dietrite.com/textonly/behindflavor.aspx DietRite.com - Behind the Flavor] Retrieved September 15, 2012.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Today it is owned by and distributed by [[Dr Pepper Snapple Group]] (known until 2008 as [[Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages]]), after the merger with [[Dr Pepper/Seven Up]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.drpeppersnapplegroup.com/brands/diet-rite/ Dr Pepper/Snapple Group - Diet Rite] Retrieved September 15, 2012.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Product containers, however, still bear the Dr Pepper/Seven Up markings.

The early 1960s broadcast media advertising campaign featured a jingle with the lyrics:
:Diet Rite Cola
:Good for you and children too
:Because it hasn&amp;apos;t got
:Any sugar at all ... new Diet Rite Cola!

==Reformulation==
*By 1969, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] banned [[cyclamate]], forcing the beverage to be reformulated with [[saccharin]].
*Diet Rite was reformulated in 1983 to eliminate sodium, making it the first sodium-free diet soda.
*In 1987, after having used a blend of the two sweeteners, the saccharin was replaced entirely with [[NutraSweet]] brand [[aspartame]] and eliminating [[caffeine]] altogether.
*In the 1990s, several fruit-flavored varieties of Diet Rite were introduced.
*In 2000, the line was reformulated yet again, this time to replace aspartame with [[Splenda]] brand [[sucralose]] and Sunett brand [[Acesulfame potassium]]. It became the first major diet soda in the United States to use neither aspartame nor saccharin as a sweetener.
*In 2005, &amp;quot;Pure Zero&amp;quot; was added to the name, and a cherry cola flavor was introduced in 2006.

==Brand decline==
*{{As of|2011}}, most stores in the United States only carry the cola flavor, and to a lesser extent red raspberry. Kiwi strawberry is no longer available at any stores or online.
*The Snapple website contains a Product Locator link for Diet Rite; however, the page it links to does not include Diet Rite as one of the available brands.
*Diet Rite is no longer listed as one of the brands on the RC Cola website.
*Despite the sparse and diminishing availability of the brand, this is the only soda currently recommended by [[Atkins]] for low-carb dieters because it does not use sugar or aspartame.

==In Popular Culture==

Diet Rite is mentioned in the [[Robert Earl Keen]] song &amp;quot;Merry Christmas from the Family.&amp;quot;
