        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Divisional Court&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in relation to the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]], means a court sitting with at least two [[judge]]s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Section 66, [[Senior Courts Act 1981]].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Matters heard by a Divisional Court include some criminal cases in the High Court (including appeals from [[Magistrates&amp;apos; Court (England and Wales)|magistrates&amp;apos; court]]s and in [[extradition]] proceedings) as well as certain [[judicial review]] cases. Although often referred to in practice as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Divisional Court, a Divisional Court is in fact not a separate court or division of the High Court but essentially refers to the number of judges sitting. Usually a Divisional Court sits with two judges but occasionally the bench comprises three judges (as it did in the recent appeal concerning disclosure of MPs&amp;apos; expenses, where the court comprised the [[President of the Queen&amp;apos;s Bench Division]], a [[Lord Justice of Appeal]] and a [[High Court Judge]]).

The best known Divisional Court is that of the [[Administrative Court (England and Wales)|Administrative Court]], which is a specialist court in the Queen&amp;apos;s Bench Division which deals with criminal and judicial review cases. There are also Divisional Courts of the [[High Court of Justice#Family Division|Family]] and [[Chancery Division]]s to deal with certain cases.

The usual constitution of a Divisional Court is one Lord Justice of Appeal and one High Court Judge, in comparison to other sittings of the High Court which are usually before a single High Court Judge.
