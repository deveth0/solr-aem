&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Diogo Briso Mainardi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-pt|dʒiˈoɡu majˈnaɾdʒi}}; born September 22, 1962) is a [[Brazil]]ian writer, [[journalist]] and TV commentator, mainly known for his articles in Brazil&amp;apos;s largest weekly magazine, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

He was born in [[São Paulo]], where he finished high school. He went to [[London]] to study economics at the [[London School of Economics]]. Not managing to maintain a passing average, he quit in his freshman year, and never graduated. During that period, he met [[Ivan Lessa]], whom he regards as one of his greatest influences.

Mainardi previously lived in [[Venice]], where he met [[Gore Vidal]] who heaped praise on him during a mid-1980s conference tour in Brazil. He has published five books: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Malthus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1989), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arquipélago&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1992), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Polígono das Secas&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1995), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Contra o Brasil&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1998), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Tapas e Pontapés&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2004). None of the first four - all novels - were successes, but his latest book, featuring excerpts of his political articles in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Veja&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, has been proven a commercial success, though showing no improvement in his writing skills. He has also written two screenplays: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;16060&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1995) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mater Dei&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2001). Both films were major box-office flops, something Mainardi regularly makes fun of in a self-deprecating manner.

Mainardi has been subject of controversy due to his elitist and far-right political positions. He often criticized Brazil&amp;apos;s president, [[Luís Inácio Lula da Silva]] (2003–2010), and his [[Workers&amp;apos; Party (Brazil)|party]]. Particularly, he liked to insist in Lula&amp;apos;s supposed lack of intelligence and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;finesse&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 2007 Mainardi wrote a book by the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lula é Minha Anta&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lula is my tapir&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).&amp;lt;ref name=ANTA&amp;gt;MAINARDI, Diogo. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lula É Minha Anta.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; São Paulo: Editora Record, 1ª edição 2007, ISBN 978-85-01-08070-7&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; (in Brazilian Portuguese slang, &amp;quot;anta&amp;quot; is an insult. When the tapir panics, it is said to run through the forest, trampling whatever is in its way. So to call someone an &amp;quot;anta&amp;quot; is to say that such person is like a stupid animal, who does violent irrational things and cannot be stopped by persuasion [http://www.dicionarioinformal.com.br/definicao.php?palavra=anta&amp;amp;id=16249]. Or, as Mainardi himself says in the book&amp;apos;s earmark, &amp;quot;Lula is mine. Only I can call him ignorant and authoritarian&amp;quot;). Due to his abusive journalistic style and vitriolic comments against Lula - as well as towards those he sees as Lula&amp;apos;s supporters -  Mainardi has been sued for libel by various politicians and fellow journalists. Journalist Franklin Martins won a 30,000 reais (about 18,000 dollars) cause against him, this decision was subsequently thrown out on an appeal; journalist Mino Carta won a 35,000 reais (about 20,000 dollars) cause.

He is currently a member of a Sunday night [[cable TV]] panel show called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Manhattan Connection&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, broadcast by the &amp;quot;Globo News&amp;quot; channel, a part of [[Globosat]].

Mainardi maintains a podcast available on the Veja website. He is married and has two sons. The older one, Tito, suffers from [[cerebral palsy]].

He regularly cites noted Brazilian intellectuals [[Paulo Francis]] and [[Ivan Lessa]] as his mentors.
