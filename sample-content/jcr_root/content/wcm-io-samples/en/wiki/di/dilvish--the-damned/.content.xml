&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dilvish, the Damned&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a collection of [[fantasy]] stories by American writer [[Roger Zelazny]], first published in 1982. Its contents were originally published as a series of separate short stories in various fantasy [[magazine]]s. Prior to publication, Zelazny&amp;apos;s working title for the book was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nine Black Doves&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Lin Carter|Carter, Lin]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, New York, Ballantine Books, 1973, p. 154.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The working title was later re-used for the fifth volume of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://www.nesfa.org/press/Books/Zelazny-Project.html The Collected Short Stories of Roger Zelazny]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; collection, as a tribute to Dilvish.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.nesfa.org/press/Books/Zelazny-5.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]] begun in this collection was resolved in the novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Changing Land]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was published before the other &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dilvish&amp;apos;&amp;apos; stories appeared in book form.

==Plot summary==
Dilvish is the descendant of both [[elves]] and [[humans]], a scion of a prominent Elven house and &amp;quot;the Human House that hath been stricken&amp;quot; which lost its peerage for mixing Elven and Human blood.  Hundreds of years before the main story, he comes across a dark ritual being performed by the [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerer]] Jelerak who is sacrificing a human girl.  He attempts to stop the ritual but is turned into stone, with his soul banished to [[Hell]].  His body became a statue, and for many decades it resided within the square of a nearby town that he had formerly saved from enemy conquerors. When this town is again in need of a hero, their citizens&amp;apos; plight allows Dilvish the passage he needed to escape from Hell. He returns to the world of the living with his steed, the metal demon horse Black, and a burning desire for revenge against Jelerak, but must first repulse the assault against the endangered town.  Dilvish then goes to call upon the Shoredan - a cursed people bound to his family.  He searches for Jelerak in the Tower of Ice and finds the sorcerer&amp;apos;s apprentice and his sister trapped there.  The two of them believe him to be a servant of Jelerak sent to kill them.
