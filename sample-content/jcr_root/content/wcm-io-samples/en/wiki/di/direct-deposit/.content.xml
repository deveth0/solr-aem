        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Direct deposit&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;direct credit&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[banking]] term that describes a deposit of money straight from the source into a [[bank account]], by [[electronic funds transfer]], or other means where the payment is initiated by the payer not the payee.  The money is transferred directly to the recipient bank through a [[payment system]].

Direct deposits facilities are often a feature of [[online banking]] systems. The direct deposit or direct credit facility is often better known by country specific payment systems used to action these payments. For example:

* [[Giro]] in most of Europe
* [[Automated Clearing House]] (ACH) in the United States
* [[Financial_system_in_Australia#Direct_Entry|Direct Entry]] in Australia

==Alternatives to direct deposit==

The U.S. federal government and some employers provide alternative electronic payment options to recipients and employees. One alternative method is a prepaid debit card.

A U.S. federal law signed in 1996 contained a provision that required the federal government to make [[payment system|electronic payments]] such as direct deposit by 1999. As a part of implementation of the provision, in 2008 the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] paired with [[Comerica Bank]] and [[MasterCard]] to offer the Direct Express Debit [[MasterCard]] [[prepaid debit card]]. The card is used to make payments to federal benefit recipients who do not have a bank account.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; [http://bankcreditnews.com/news/federal-government-chooses-direct-deposit-and-prepaid-cards-over-mailing-checks/9413/ “Federal government chooses direct deposit and prepaid cards over mailing checks”], BankCreditNews, 15 Apr 2013, Accessed 22 Apr 2013 &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
