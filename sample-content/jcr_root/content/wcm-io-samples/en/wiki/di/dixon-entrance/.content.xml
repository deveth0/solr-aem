Red dots indicate capes and points, gray text indicates island names. The international boundary between Canada and the United States follows [[Portland Canal]] to &amp;quot;Point B&amp;quot;, thence to [[Cape Muzon]].

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dixon Entrance&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[strait]] about {{convert|80|km|mi}} long and wide in the [[Pacific Ocean]] at the [[Canada–United States border|International Boundary]] between the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Alaska]] and the province of [[British Columbia]] in [[Canada]].  It was named by [[Joseph Banks]] for Captain [[George Dixon (captain)|George Dixon]], a [[Royal Navy]] officer, [[fur trade]]r, and explorer, who surveyed the area in 1787.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |last= Middleton |first= Lynn |title= Place Names of the Pacific Northwest Coast |year= 1969 |publisher= Elldee Publishing |location= Victoria |oclc= 16729415 |page= 65}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The Dixon Entrance is part of the [[Inside Passage]] shipping route. It forms part of the [[maritime boundary]] between the U.S. and Canada, although the location of that boundary here is disputed.  A name used in the [[Haida language|Haida]] is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Seegaay&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which means only &amp;quot;ocean&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;!--it would have Tlingit and Tsimshian names also, N.B.--&amp;gt;

The Dixon Entrance lies between [[Clarence Strait]] in the [[Alexander Archipelago]] in [[Alaska]] to the north, and [[Hecate Strait]] and the islands known as [[Haida Gwaii]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The islands on the south side of the Entrance which are officially named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Haida Gwaii&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by the Province of British Columbia in 2010, at the request of the [[Haida people]].  The new name, meaning &amp;quot;land of the people&amp;quot;, originated in the 1970s.  These islands are still quite widely known by their historical name, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Queen Charlotte Islands.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; (the Queen Charlotte Islands) in [[British Columbia]], to the south. [[Prince of Wales Island, Alaska]], is the largest of the Alaskan islands on the north side of the entrance, and is also home to a branch of the Haida, known as the Kaigani Haida.    Members of the [[Haida people|Haida]] nation maintain free access across the Strait.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}&amp;lt;!--&amp;quot;free&amp;quot; doesn&amp;apos;t seem the right word; they still have to notify of crossings I believe--&amp;gt;

The so-called &amp;quot;A-B Line&amp;quot; (approximately [[Parallel 54°40′ north|54°40&amp;apos;N]]), which marks the northern boundary of the Dixon Entrance, was delineated during the [[Hay-Herbert Treaty|1903 Alaska Boundary Treaty]]. The meaning of the line remains in dispute between Canada and the United States. Canada claims the line is the international maritime boundary, while the United States holds that its purpose was only to designate which islands belonged to which country, and holds that the maritime boundary is an equidistant line between islands.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.cwilson.com/pubs/energy/alaska.pdf The Alaska Boundary Dispute], Tony Fogarassy, Clark Wilson LLP&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Territorial fishing disputes between the countries remain today, as the United States does not recognize the A-B Line for purposes of seafloor resources or fishing rights and has never shown the treaty boundary on its own official maps.
