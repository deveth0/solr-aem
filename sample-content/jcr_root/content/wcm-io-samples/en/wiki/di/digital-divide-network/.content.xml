        text="&lt;p&gt;[[TakingITGlobal]] in [[Toronto, Canada]] produces and coordinates the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Digital Divide Network&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;DDN&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), which is a spinoff of [http://www.Helping.org Helping.org] (Helping.org later changed its name to [http://www.Networkforgood.org Networkforgood.org]). The network seeks to narrow the [[digital divide]]. The website serves as an online community of activists, policymakers, researchers and concerned citizens interested in sharing knowledge to help bridge the digital divide.

== History ==

DDN was originally launched as the Digital Divide Clearinghouse in October 1999. The Clearinghouse was a section of a larger web portal called Helping.org. Launched by the [[AOL Foundation]], the [[Benton Foundation]], the [[National Urban League]] and other institutions, Helping.org was dedicated to volunteerism, technology [[capacity building]] for [[Non-profit organizations|nonprofits]] and charitable giving. Two months after the website was launched, [[Bill Clinton]] hosted a national Digital Divide Summit in [[Washington D.C.]] During the meeting, representatives from [[civil society]] and the private sector met with Clinton; soon, the idea was hatched to create a new national [[Web portal]] dedicated to bridging the digital divide. This decision led to the Digital Divide Clearinghouse spinning off from Helping.org to become a new website, [http://www.digitaldividenetwork.org The Digital Divide Network], which was launching in December 1999 by the Benton Foundation.

DDN has become a leading website for organizations interested in sharing news, research and other resources to help bridge the digital divide. The site has become more international as well, with users from more than 75 countries. In February 2004, the site and its senior staff relocated to [[Massachusetts]] to move their operation to [http://www.edc.org the Education Development Center] (EDC), as part of the creation of a new institute called the [http://cmc.edc.org EDC Center for Media &amp;amp; Community]. DDN was then managed by director [[Andy Carvin]]. Cedar Pruitt served as website editor from April 2004 until September 2005. DDN is now managed by [http://www.takingitglobal.org TakingITGlobal.org], the Toronto-based [[NGO]] that redesigned the website in 2004.  Andy Carvin is no longer directly involved in the website, though he continues to moderate the group&amp;apos;s email discussion list.

== Technical / contact problems ==
The [http://www.digitaldivide.net/about/contact.php publicized contact email address] was bouncing emails. It has since been fixed.
--&amp;gt;

== Spam problems ==
The site has recently had improvements made to eliminate recent spam problems, where spammers were creating blogs and community pages with the sole purpose of redirecting them to spam sites.
