&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dildo Island&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an island in the Canadian province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. It is the largest of three islands located at the entrance to Dildo Arm in the bottom of [[Trinity Bay (Newfoundland)|Trinity Bay]], off the coast of the neighbouring town of [[Dildo, Newfoundland and Labrador|Dildo]].

An [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavation in 1995 discovered [[Dorset culture|Dorset]] artifacts dated to between AD 150 and AD 750. It is believed that these people camped on Dildo Island for the purpose of seal hunting.

In 2001 excavations were begun on a recently-discovered Indian site that radiocarbon dated to between AD 720 and AD 960. Evidence of a camp was found with the remnants of a [[wigwam]] and [[hearth]]. Almost all of the [[tool]]s were made from purple and blue [[rhyolite]]s that came from a source in [[Bonavista Bay]] roughly {{convert|145|km}} to the north.

[[John Guy (governor)|John Guy]]&amp;apos;s journal of 1612 suggested evidence of a [[Beothuk]] Indian camp on Dildo Island. An English [[fort]] was established in the early 18th century to defend the south side of [[Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trinity Bay]] from the French during [[Queen Anne&amp;apos;s War]].

==Dildo Island hatchery==
A cod hatchery operated on Dildo Island from 1889 to 1896. Created by Adolf Neilsen, funded by the Newfoundland government, the hatchery produced at its peak 200 million cod per year. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Newfoundland and Labradorâ€™s Aquaculture Industry|url=http://www.gmo.nl.ca/classkitdocs/NL.Aquaculture.Industry.pdf|work=Getting the Message Out (GMO)|publisher=Department of Innovation, Business, and Rural Development.
