&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Disumbrationism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[hoax]] masquerading as an [[art movement]] that was launched in 1924 by [[Paul Jordan-Smith]], a [[novel]]ist, [[Latin]] scholar, and authority on [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] from [[Los Angeles, California]].

Annoyed at the cold reception his wife&amp;apos;s [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] [[still life]]s had received from an art exhibition jury, Jordan-Smith sought revenge by styling himself as &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pavel Jerdanowitch&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; ([[Cyrillic]]: Па́вел Жердaнович), a variation on his own name, and entering a blurry, badly painted picture of a [[Pacific islands|Pacific islander]] woman brandishing a banana skin, under the title &amp;quot;Exaltation&amp;quot;.  He made a suitably dark and brooding photograph of himself as Jerdanowitch, and submitted the work to the same group of critics as representative of the new school, &amp;quot;Disumbrationism&amp;quot;.  He explained &amp;quot;Exaltation&amp;quot; as a symbol of &amp;quot;breaking the shackles of womanhood.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Museum of Hoaxes, [http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/archive/permalink/the_disumbrationist_school_of_art/ The Disumbrationist School of Art]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; To his dismay, if not to his surprise, the Disumbrationist daub won praise from the critics who had belittled his wife&amp;apos;s realistic painting.

More Disumbrationist paintings followed: a composition of zig-zag lines and eyeballs he called &amp;quot;Illumination&amp;quot;; a garish picture of a black woman doing laundry which he called &amp;quot;Aspiration&amp;quot;, and which a critic praised as &amp;quot;a delightful jumble of [[Gauguin]], Pop Hart and [[Negro]] [[minstrel]]sy, with a lot of Jerdanowitch individuality&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Gination&amp;quot;, an ugly, lopsided [[portrait]]; and a painting named &amp;quot;Adoration&amp;quot;, of a woman worshipping an immense phallic idol, which was exhibited in 1927.

The same year, Jordan-Smith confessed to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Los Angeles Times]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; that the Disumbrationist paintings were meant as a [[parody|spoof]].&amp;lt;Ref name=&amp;quot;reveal1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;(27 January 1931).

Since 2006 there has been held a yearly painting contest in memory of Paul Jordan-Smith and the disumbrationist school of arts: the &amp;quot;International Pavel Jerdanowitch Painting contest&amp;quot;. The winners were Kurt Hinterbichler in 2006, kunst/gruppe olga in 2007 and Olga Krolik in 2008.
