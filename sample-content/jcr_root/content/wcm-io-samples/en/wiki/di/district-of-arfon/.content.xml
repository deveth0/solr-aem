&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arfon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was one of five [[Districts of Wales|district]]s of [[Gwynedd]], [[Wales]], from 1974 to 1996.

It was created by the [[Local Government Act 1972]] on 1 April 1974 from part of the [[Administrative counties of Wales|administrative county]] of [[Caernarfonshire]], namely  the [[municipal borough]]s of [[Bangor, Wales|Bangor]] and [[Caernarfon]], the [[Bethesda, Wales|Bethesda]] [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]], the [[rural district]]s of [[Ogwen Rural District|Ogwen]], and the [[Gwyrfai Rural District]], less the [[civil parish|parishes]] of [[Beddgelert]] and [[Clynnog]].

It was abolished as a district on 1 April 1996, when Gwynedd was reconstituted as a unitary authority.  The area remains in use for an [[area committee]] of [[Gwynedd Council]].

==Etymology==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arfon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; means &amp;quot;opposite Anglesey&amp;quot; (&amp;apos;Ar&amp;apos; + &amp;apos;Fôn&amp;apos; which is the [[soft mutation]] of &amp;apos;Môn&amp;apos;, the Welsh name for Anglesey). The name is ancient and has been used to designate the area since early medieval times. In the Middle Ages [[Cantref Arfon]] was an administrative unit of the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]]. Arfon survived as a geocultural name (Welsh: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;bro&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) over the centuries and remains in use today. It is also sometimes found as a personal name (e.g. [[Arfon Griffiths]]).
