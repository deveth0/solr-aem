        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Estonian Educational and Research Network (EENet)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a governmental nonprofit organization established in August 1993 by the Ministry of Education of [[Estonia]] with the task of managing, coordinating and developing the [[computer network]] of [[science]], [[education]] and [[culture]]. Since 1997 EENet operates as a state agency administered by the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research.

In 1993 the whole network consisted of less than two hundred computers in [[Tartu]] and [[Tallinn]]. In the beginning of the year 2004 the number of end-users of Estonian academic network was approximately 210,000 people: researchers, students, teachers, pupils etc. The network extends to most counties in Estonia.

The mission of EENet is to provide a high quality national network infrastructure for the Estonian research, educational and cultural communities. The services of EENet include permanent Internet connection as well as several other services - [[webhosting]], [[e-mail]] services, [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Domain Name System|DNS]], consultations in case of security problems, etc. Development projects are being carried out in cooperation with universities and institutes. In 2004 the project &amp;quot;[[Estonian GRID]]&amp;quot; (Eesti GRID) was started. EENet also participates in the BalticGrid-II project,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Support Portal Live And Operational, 2009 (Documentation of the BalticGrid Users&amp;apos;s Forum)[http://www.balticgrid.org/Deliverables/pdfs/BGII-DSA3.4-v1.3-EENet-Support-portal-live-and-operational.pdf]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and manages the BalticGrid Portal, which is based on [[P-GRADE Portal]] technology.
