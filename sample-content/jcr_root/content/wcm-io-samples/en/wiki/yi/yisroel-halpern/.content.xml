        text="&lt;p&gt;Rabbi &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yisroel Halpern,&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yisroel Karduner&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (died 1920), was a [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Breslover]] Hasid who lived in [[Palestine|Ottoman Palestine]] at the turn of the century.

==Biography==
Born in [[Poland]], Halpern was introduced to the teachings of [[Nachman of Breslov|Rebbe Nachman of Breslov]] when he came across a copy of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Tikkun HaKlali]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Rebbe Nachman&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;General Remedy,&amp;quot; a specific formulation of ten [[Psalms]]). Halpern&amp;apos;s reading of this work inspired him to move to [[Ukraine]], where he studied under Reb [[Moshe Breslover]]. Many people were attracted to Breslover Hasidut after hearing him pray and sing with intense devotion. Several Breslover [[nigunim]] (melodies) are directly attributed to him. His best-known quote is: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;There was someone [Rebbe Nachman] who called out 100 years ago, &amp;apos;Never give up!&amp;apos; and we still hear that voice today&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He was the teacher of Rabbi [[Yisroel Ber Odesser]], and brought many other people closer to Breslov Hasidut through his intense devotions and beautiful songs.

==Aliyah to Israel==
He immigrated to the [[Holy Land]] in the early 1900s and lived in [[Meron (Israel)|Meron]], [[Safed]], and [[Tiberias]].
Halpern lost his entire family in a plague in Tiberias, where he is also buried.
