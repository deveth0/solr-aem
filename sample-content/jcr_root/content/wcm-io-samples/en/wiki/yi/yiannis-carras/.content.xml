&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Constantine Carras&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Lang-el|Γιάννης Καρράς}}; 1907–89) was a Greek shipping [[magnate]], grandson of captain and sailing-ship owner Ioannis I. Carras (1852–1927) from Kardamyla of [[Chios]]. In the late 1960s the fleet of the J. C. Carras group of companies attained its zenith, with 34 ships of an overall capacity some 640,000 dwt. During that time he was also involved in the real estate and tourist business and bought an extended area in [[Sithonia]], [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula in northern [[Greece]] and in 1973 he started constructing a tourist resort, known as [[Porto Carras]], which became one of the most famous holiday resorts in Greece. Yiannis Carras died in 1989.
