==History==
NCOD was founded in 1988 by Robert Eichberg, a psychologist from New Mexico and founder of the personal growth workshop, The Experience, and [[Jean O&amp;apos;Leary]], an openly gay political leader from Los Angeles and then head of the National Gay Rights Advocates.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Robert Eichberg, 50, Gay Rights Leader|date=August 15, 1995|publisher=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/15/obituaries/robert-eichberg-50-gay-rights-leader.html}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Robert Eichberg, Gay Advocate|date=August 14, 1995|publisher=The Seattle Times|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950814&amp;amp;slug=2136369}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The date of October 11 was chosen because it was the anniversary of the 1987 [[Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights|National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;HRC_NCOD&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

The first headquarters was located in the West Hollywood, California offices of the National Gay Rights Advocates.  Eighteen states participated in the first NCOD, which was covered in the national media.  In its second year, the headquarters moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico and participation grew to 21 states.  After a media push in 1990, NCOD was observed in all 50 states and seven other countries.  Participation continued to grow and in 1990 NCOD merged their efforts with the [[Human Rights Campaign]] Fund.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;HRC_NCOD&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Observance==
National Coming Out Day is observed annually to celebrate [[coming out]] and to [[Raising awareness|raise awareness]] of the [[Gay community|LGBT community]] and [[LGBT social movements|civil rights movement]].  The holiday is observed in a wide variety of ways: from rallies and parades to information tables in public spaces.  Participants often wear [[LGBTQ symbols|pride symbols]] such as [[pink triangle]]s and [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|rainbow flags]].

National Coming Out Day is observed in many countries, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Croatia]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Poland]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United Kingdom]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  In the United States, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] sponsors NCOD events under the auspices of their National Coming Out Project, offering resources to LGBT individuals, couples, parents and children, as well as straight friends and relatives, to promote awareness of LGBT families living honest and open lives. [[Candace Gingrich]] became the spokesperson for NCOD in April 1995.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;HRC_NCOD&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
