&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The National Olympiad in Informatics&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (NOI) is an annual [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] [[competition]] for secondary school students. The first NOI was held in 1984, earlier than [[International_Olympiad_in_Informatics|IOI]].

== Overview ==
The contest consists of one practice contest and two official competitions, each involving solving problems of an [[Algorithm|algorithmic]] nature. Each day&amp;apos;s competition consists of three problems and contestants have five hours to try to solve them. Students compete on an individual basis, with up to five students competing from each participating [[Province of China|province]] (with around 30 provinces in 2003). Students are selected from similar contests in their own province.
