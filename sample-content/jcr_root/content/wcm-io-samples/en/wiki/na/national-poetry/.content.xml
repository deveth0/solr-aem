        text="&lt;p&gt;This is a list of articles about [[poetry]] in a single [[language]] or produced by a single [[nation]].

[[World language]]s will tend to have a large body of poetry contributed to by several nations ([[Anglosphere]], [[Francophonie]], [[Latin America]], [[German-speaking Europe]]), while for smaller languages, the body of poetry in a particular language will be identical to the national poetry of the nation or ethnicity associated with that language.
