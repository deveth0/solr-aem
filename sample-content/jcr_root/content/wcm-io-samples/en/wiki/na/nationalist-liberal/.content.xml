&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nationalist Liberal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a banner under which several Canadian political have run or sat.

It was first used by [[Luc Letellier de St-Just]] in the Senate in 1867.

It was also the label under which [[Fleming Blanchard McCurdy]] ran in a [[by-election]] held in [[Colchester (electoral district)|Colchester]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]], on September 20, 1920.

McCurdy had been a [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] Member of Parliament since 1911 and, as all Conservatives, became a [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist]] in 1917, serving as [[Parliamentary Secretary]] to Sir [[Robert Borden]].

[[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Arthur Meighen]] appointed McCurdy to his [[Canadian cabinet|Cabinet]] as Minister of Public Works in July 1920. At that time, new Cabinet appointees were required to seek re-election in a by-election. It is unknown why McCurdy ran as a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nationalist Liberal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but it may have had something to do with the fact that the Conservative/Unionist Party had changed its formal name to the [[National Liberal and Conservative Party]] or because his sole challenger was a member of the newly formed, left-wing [[Progressive Party of Canada|United Farmers]]. McCurdy won the 1920 by-election by a narrow margin. He reverted to the Conservative label in 1921 and was defeated.
