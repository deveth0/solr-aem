At a cost of 10,000 [[U.S. dollar]]s each, the company [[recoup]]s its [[investment]] in the units by keeping 90[[%]] of the [[advertising]] [[revenue]] it earns, paying the other 10% as [[renting|rent]] to the owner of the space.

As a [[test market]], N続 has installed about 40 of the units in [[bathroom]]s of [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s and [[nightclub]]s in [[metro Atlanta]].  It intends to expand to [[hotel]]s, [[theme park]]s, [[student center]]s, [[liquor]] stores, and even [[banking|bank]]s.  The chief [[demographic]] is ages 21 to 35.

Besides [[Atlanta]], tests have also been conducted in [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]], with plans for [[New York (city)|New York]], [[Dallas]], [[Chicago]], and [[Miami]].

N続 has also installed the [[Information appliance|device]]s in [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] stations (Atlanta&amp;apos;s [[rapid transit|metro]] transit system).

Atlanta&amp;apos;s [[Titan Network]] LLC has provided [[Consultant|consulting]], [[market research]], [[public relations]] and advertising for N続.
