The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;nasal bones&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are two small oblong [[bone]]s, varying in size and form in different individuals; they are placed side by side at the middle and upper part of the [[face]], and form, by their junction, &amp;quot;the bridge&amp;quot; of the [[human nose|nose]].

Each has two surfaces and four borders.

== Surfaces ==
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;outer surface&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is [[concavoconvex]] from above downward, convex from side to side; it is covered by the [[Procerus muscle|Procerus]] and [[Compressor naris]], and perforated about its center by a foramen, for the transmission of a small [[vein]].

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;inner surface&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is concave from side to side, and is traversed from above downward, by a groove for the passage of a branch of the [[nasociliary nerve]].

== Articulations ==
The nasal articulates with four bones: two of the cranium, the [[Frontal bone|frontal]] and [[ethmoid]], and two of the face, the opposite nasal and the [[maxilla]].

==In other animals==
In primitive [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]] and [[tetrapod]]s, the nasal bones are the most anterior of a set of four paired bones forming the roof of the skull, being followed in sequence by the frontals, the [[parietal bone|parietal]]s, and the [[postparietal]]s. Their form in living species is highly variable, depending on the shape of the head, but they generally form the roof of the snout or beak, running from the nostrils to a position short of the orbits. In most animals, they are generally therefore proportionally larger than in humans or great apes, because of the shortened faces of the latter. [[Turtle]]s, unusually, lack nasal bones, with the [[prefrontal]] bones of the orbit reaching all the way to the nostrils.&amp;lt;ref name=VB&amp;gt;{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 217â€“241|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
