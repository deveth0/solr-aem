        text="&lt;p&gt;{{Primarysources|article|date=May 2011}}The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;National Cholesterol Education Program&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a program managed by the [[National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute]], a division of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[National Institutes of Health]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Its goal is to reduce increased [[cardiovascular disease]] rates due to [[hypercholesterolemia]] (elevated [[cholesterol]] levels) in the [[United States of America]]. The program has been running since 1985.

The assigned goal of the NCEP committee is to meet on a recurring basis, review ongoing scientific research about [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] [[cardiovascular disease]] and make simplified, consensus, committee recommendations to be promoted by the [[NIH]], the [[American Heart Association]] and other groups to both physicians and the public about how to reduce the incidence of disability and death resulting from [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] [[cardiovascular disease]].
