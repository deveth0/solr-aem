The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;National Veterans Inquiry&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a national-level inquiry into American war crimes in Vietnam.  They were held December 1â€“3, 1970 in Washington, DC.

==Origin==
In November 1969, after the [[My Lai]] massacre became known, the [[Bertrand Russell]] Foundation, with antiwar activists [[Jeremy Rifkin]] and lawyer [[Tod Ensign]], organized the [[Citizens Commission of Inquiry]] (CCI) in the United States to document American war crimes in Vietnam.  The CCI, held their first inquiry in February 1970 in Annapolis, Maryland.

Further inquiries were held in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Massachusetts]]; [[Richmond, Virginia]]; [[New York City]]; [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]; [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]; [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]; [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]; and, [[Portland, Oregon]]. In some cities, the commissions were co-sponsored by antiwar coalitions, in others they were organized independently.

Men who had taken part in the [[CIA]]&amp;apos;s [[Phoenix Program]] described it as a program based on terror, torture, and assassination.
