The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Marine Protected Area of the United States]] located  on [[Prudence Island|Prudence]], [[Patience Island|Patience]], and [[Hope Island (Rhode Island)|Hope]] islands in [[Narragansett Bay]] in the state of [[Rhode Island]].

It was established in August 1980 under the [[Coastal Zone Management Act]].
The reserve encompasses 2,353 acres (9.5&amp;amp;nbsp;km²) of land as well as 1,591 acres (6.4&amp;amp;nbsp;km²) of water adjoining the islands out to a depth of {{Convert|18|ft}}. During the colonial era, all three islands were used for farming. By the 20th century, farming had declined and Prudence Island began to attract summer residents. During [[World War II]], the U.S. military established a presence on the island and remained until 1972, when the land was turned over to the state of Rhode Island.

It encompasses coastal, estuarine, and tidal habitats.

The reserve is managed by the [[Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management]] as a federal/state partnership in cooperation with [[NOAA]].
