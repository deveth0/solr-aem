The [[United States]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;National Film Preservation Board&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the [[committee |board]] selecting [[film]]s for preservation in the [[Library of Congress]]&amp;apos; [[National Film Registry]]. It was established by the [[National Film Preservation Act]] of 1988.  The National Film Registry is meant to preserve up to 25 &amp;quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant films&amp;quot; each year; to be eligible, films must be at least 10 years old.  Members of the Board also advise the Librarian of Congress on ongoing development and implementation of the national film preservation plan.

The National Film Preservation Board (NFPB) is a federal agency located within the Library of Congress.  The NFPB was established by the National Film Preservation Act of 1988, and reauthorized in 1992, 1996 and 2005. The 1996 reauthorization also created the non-profit [[National Film Preservation Foundation]], which is loosely affiliated with the National Film Preservation Board, but the private-sector Foundation (NFPF) and federal Board (NFPB) are separate, legally distinct entities.
