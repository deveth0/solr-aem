&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Narrative of the Chinese Embassy to the Khan of the Tourgouth Tartars, in the years 1712, 13, 14, and 15&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a record of the travel to [[Kalmykia]],  written by [[Tulisen|Tulišen]], a [[Manchu]] official of the [[Qing Dynasty]].

The book, which was originally written in [[Manchu language|Manchu]], was later translated into [[Classical Chinese|Chinese]]. The title is:
*in Manchu: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lakcaha jecen-de takūraha babe ejehe bithe&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Image:lakcaha1.png|100px]]  (The book of the account of the process of having been to a distant region as an ambassador)
*in Chinese: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yiyulu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Zh|t=異域錄|p=Yìyùlù}}, ‘Record of foreign regions’)

The English title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Narrative of the Chinese Embassy to the Khan of the Tourgouth Tartars, in the years 1712, 13, 14, and 15, by the Chinese Ambassador, and published by the Emperor&amp;apos;s Authority, at [[Peking]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is of Sir [[George Thomas Staunton]]&amp;apos;s translation in 1821. Although the Chinese version is more popular, the Manchu version offers higher quality information.

In 1712 [[Kangxi Emperor of China|Kangxi Emperor]] sent Tulišen and other emissaries to the [[Kalmyk people#The_Kalmyk_Khanate|Kalmyk Khanate]] to convey an imperial edict to [[Ayuki Khan]] of the [[Torghuts]]. They left [[Beijing]], crossed [[Mongolia]] and then entered [[Russia]]. In order to avoid [[Dzungaria]], they travelled through the [[Imperial Russia|Russia Empire]] to [[Saratov]] and entered into Ayuki&amp;apos;s Torghut state (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Turgūt gurun&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in Manchu). Having accomplished the mission, they returned to Beijing in 1715. Tulišen reported to the Emperor in both Manchu and Chinese. With the Emperor&amp;apos;s permission, he published the book by editing these reports and private notes.

The formal purpose of this mission was to negotiate over the return of Ayuki&amp;apos;s nephew Arabjur to [[Kalmykia]]. As a Buddhist, he made a pilgrimage to [[Tibet]] but was unable to return to Kalmykia because of the [[Dzungars]]&amp;apos; obstruction. Another purpose was to reconnoiter expanding Russia. In fact, the book is mostly devoted to the description of Russia. Some Russians suspected that they the emissaries secretly encouraged the Torghuud to return to their homeland as Ayuki&amp;apos;s great-grandson [[Ubasi]] did later.
