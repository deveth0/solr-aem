A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;naturally aspirated engine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[internal combustion engine]], in which fuel intake depends solely on [[atmospheric pressure]].

== Description ==

In a naturally aspirated engine, air for combustion ([[diesel cycle]] in a [[diesel engine]], or specific types of [[Otto cycle]] in gasoline engines – namely [[gasoline direct injection]]), or an air/fuel mixture (traditional Otto cycle petrol engines) is drawn into the engines [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]] by atmospheric pressure acting against a [[vacuum|partial vacuum]] that occurs as the [[piston]] travels downwards toward [[dead centre|bottom dead centre]] during the induction [[stroke (engine)|stroke]].  Owing to innate restriction in the engine&amp;apos;s inlet tract which includes the [[Inlet manifold|intake manifold]], a small pressure drop occurs as air is drawn in, resulting in a [[volumetric efficiency]] of less than 100&amp;amp;nbsp;percent – and a less than complete air charge in the cylinder.  The density of the air charge, and therefore the engine&amp;apos;s maximum theoretical [[power (physics)|power output]], in addition to being influenced by induction system restriction, is also affected by engine speed and atmospheric pressure, the latter which decreases as the operating [[altitude]] increases.

This is in contrast to a [[forced induction]] engine, in which a mechanically driven [[supercharger]], or an exhaust-driven [[turbocharger]] is employed to facilitate in increasing the mass of intake air beyond what could be produced by atmospheric pressure alone.

As a [[two-stroke diesel engine]] is incapable of natural aspiration as defined above, some method of charging the cylinders with scavenging air must be integrated into the engine design.  This is usually achieved with a [[Roots-type supercharger|positive displacement blower]] driven by the [[crankshaft]].  The blower does not act as a supercharger in this application, as it is sized to produce a volume of air flow that is in direct proportion to engine&amp;apos;s requirement for combustion, at a given power and speed.  By the [[SAE_International|Society of Automotive Engineer]]&amp;apos;s definition, a mechanically scavenged two-stroke diesel engine is considered to be naturally aspirated.

== Applications ==

Most [[automobile]] petrol engines, as well as many small engines used for non-automotive purposes, are naturally aspirated.  Most modern diesel engines powering highway vehicles are turbocharged to produce a more favourable [[power-to-weight ratio]], as well as better [[fuel efficiency]] and lower [[Vehicle emissions control|exhaust emissions]].  Turbocharging is nearly universal on diesel engines that are used in [[Rail transport|railroad]], [[Marine propulsion|marine engine]]s, and commercial [[:wikt:stationary|stationary]] applications ([[Electricity generation|electrical power generation]], for example).  Forced induction is also used with reciprocating [[aircraft engine]]s to negate some of the power loss that occurs as the [[aircraft]] climbs to higher altitudes.
