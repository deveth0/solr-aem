&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Naphill&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|æ|p|h|ɪ|l}} is a village in the [[parish]] of [[Hughenden Valley]], in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]]. It is north-west of Hughenden, on the ridge of one of the [[Chiltern Hills]], and is adjacent to the village of [[Walter&amp;apos;s Ash]].

The origin of its name is obscure. It is sometimes thought that people napped [[flint]]s here, but this is disputed.

Naphill is a mainly linear settlement, with nearly all the houses built on side-roads branching off Main Road, which is just over 1 mile (1.6&amp;amp;nbsp;km) long.

Naphill borders the ancient parishes of [[Bradenham]], [[North Dean]], and [[West Wycombe]]. Whilst a village in its own right, it is part of the Parish of Hughenden, and is located around the former border between two ancient British tribes, the [[Catuvellauni]] and the [[Atrebates]]. It is close to the ancient feature [[Grimm&amp;apos;s Ditch]].

Walter&amp;apos;s Ash in Naphill is the location of RAF Strike Command, which contains a nuclear bunker built on National Trust land in 1983–1985. This lies near the wartime Bomber Command bunker built in the 1930&amp;apos;s. There was a peace camp during the time of the construction of the nuclear bunker.

== Naphill Common ==
Naphill Common takes up a large part of Naphill, running the whole length of the village&amp;apos;s west side. It is larger and more wooded than its neighbour, [[Downley]] Common. The Common contains evidence of an industrial background, including [[medieval]] [[iron smelting]]. Pieces of iron [[slag]] have been found in the area, which was once semi-enclosed. Also pieces of pottery dated to the 12th to 15th centuries have been found turned up by rabbits.

Naphill Common is home to several very large [[beech]] and [[oak]] trees. One beech tree has grown on a medieval enclosure, the purposes of which enclosure is unknown because only three of its sides are visible. Most of the iron [[kiln]]s and pottery are to be found in this part of Naphill. Originally, Naphill Common was more open, with large trees separated by grass-covered open ground, rather than the dense wood that has grown up around it.

Naphill Common is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002879.pdf Natural England: SSSI citation]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
