&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Natalia Ivanovna Sedova&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Ната́лья Ива́новна Седо́ва}}; April 5, 1882, [[Romny]] &amp;amp;ndash; January 23, 1962, [[Corbeil-Essonnes|Corbeil]]) is best known as the second wife of [[Leon Trotsky]], the [[Russian people|Russian]] revolutionary. She was, however, also an active revolutionary in her own right and wrote on cultural matters pertaining to [[Marxism]]. Her father was [[Ivan Sedov]], a famous explorer of the [[Arctic]].{{fact|date=April 2010}}

Her life was marked by the same tragedy as that of her lover, as she accompanied him into his final exile from [[RSFSR|Russia]]. Her son, [[Lev Sedov]], was an active and leading member of the [[Bolshevik-Leninism|Bolshevik-Leninist]] movement that his father led and was almost certainly assassinated as a result of that. Her other son, [[Sergei Sedov]], who was not politically active and remained in Russia, was almost certainly murdered by agents of [[Joseph Stalin]].

After her husband&amp;apos;s assassination in 1940, Natalia Sedova remained in [[Mexico]] and maintained contact with many exiled revolutionaries. Her best known work in these last years was a biography of Trotsky, which she co-authored with fellow Russian revolutionary [[Victor Serge]]. She was also close to the [[Spain|Spanish]] revolutionary [[Grandizo Munis]] who had led the tiny Spanish [[Sección Bolchevique-Leninista]] during the revolutionary events in the 1930s. Under his influence, she came to adopt the position that the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] was a [[state capitalism|state capitalist]] society and that the [[Fourth International]] founded by Trotsky no longer held to the revolutionary programme of Communism. Therefore, she broke from the FI in 1951.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Natalia Sedova Trotsky, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/sedova-natalia/1951/05/09.htm Letter of Resignation from the Fourth International], 9 May 1951.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
