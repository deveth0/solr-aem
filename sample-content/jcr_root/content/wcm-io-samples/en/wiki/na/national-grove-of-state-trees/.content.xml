        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;National Grove of State Trees&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an attraction at the [[United States National Arboretum]]. The [[grove (nature)|grove]]s are planted on 30 acres (120,000&amp;amp;nbsp;mÂ²) of rolling terrain celebrate the diversity and importance of [[tree]]s to all 50 states and the [[District of Columbia]].

Each [[U.S. state|state]] is represented by a loosely arranged grove of several trees that are spaced widely enough to accommodate their mature dimensions.

[[Bald cypress]] that might be found in a [[Louisiana swamplands|Louisiana swamp]] grow just a short walk from pines and birches that grow in [[New England]] forests; young [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwoods]] from [[California]] grow near [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]]s that might grow in riverside forests in the otherwise treeless [[Great Plains]] States.

Most states adopted their [[List of U.S. state trees|state trees]] in the period following unprecedented industrial and [[agriculture|agricultural]] expansion in the late 19th century and early 20th century.  Entire forests were stripped during this period for building materials, fuel wood, and to clear land for crops and [[livestock]].  Along with grassroots concerns about preservation of forests and trees came a natural pride in a part of the local flora, and the concept of a state tree was born.

Although the mid Atlantic region of the [[United States]] has mild weather which allows the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] to grow most of the species designated by the various states as their arboreal emblems, it cannot successfully grow a few of the state trees such as the [[cabbage palmetto]], which is the state tree of both [[Florida]] and [[South Carolina]], or the [[kukui]], which is [[Hawaii]]&amp;apos;s state tree.

Substitutes have been made for these species so the arboretum could have a tree that is important in each of the states.  Planting was undertaken in 1989 with the [[National Association of State Foresters]], the [[American Forest Foundation]], the [[USDA Forest Service]], and the U.S. National Arboretum joining forces to create the Grove of State Trees.

The centerpiece of the collection is the portal adjacent to the [[M Street (Washington, DC)|M Street]] Parking Lot in Washington, D.C.  A wooden entrance arbor is dedicated to the memory of [[Jeanne Yeutter]], wife of former Secretary of Agriculture [[Clayton Yeutter]], whose sponsorship of the project helped the concept of a Grove of State Trees to be realized.  The inscription on the arbor reads &amp;quot;In Celebration of Jeanne Yeutter&amp;apos;s Love of Trees&amp;quot;.  The arbor leads to a large plaza with a flagstone star and a wall adorned with pottery tiles designed and fabricated by [[Liza Bach]], a [[Tennessee]] crafter.  Each tile is individually cast with the name of each state and a raised image of the foliage of the state tree.

Although a complete trail system is planned to link all the individual plantings of state trees, as of 2004, only a small portion of the trail is complete, and most of the collection is not accessible to the handicapped.
