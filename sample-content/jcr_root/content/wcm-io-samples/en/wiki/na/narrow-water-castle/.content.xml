==History==
In 1212, a [[keep]] was built on the site by [[Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster|Hugh de Lacy]], first [[Earl of Ulster]], to prevent river-borne attacks on [[Newry]]. In the 1560s, the tower house and bawn were built. It is a typical example of the tower houses built throughout Ireland from the 14th until the early 17th century. This kind of building, normally rectangular in plan and three or more storeys high, comprised a series of superimposed chambers, with stairs, closets and latrines skillfully contrived within the walls (which are 1.5 metres or five feet thick in places) or sometimes contained in projecting angle turrets.

The original was destroyed in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|1641 Rebellion]].

Nowadays, cruises past the castle are a regular feature throughout the summer months.

On 27 August 1979, 18 [[British Army]] soldiers were killed by a [[Provisional IRA]] ambush at Narrow Water Castle (see [[Warrenpoint ambush|Narrow Water ambush]]). It was the greatest single loss of life for the British Army during [[The Troubles]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/27/newsid_3891000/3891055.stm|title=On this day - 27 August|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2008-04-26 | date=27 August 1979}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
