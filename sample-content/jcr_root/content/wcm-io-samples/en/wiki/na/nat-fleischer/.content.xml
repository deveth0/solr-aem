&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nathaniel Stanley Fleischer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (November 3, 1887, [[New York]] â€“ June 25, 1972) was a noted [[United States|American]] [[boxing]] writer and collector. After graduated from [[City College of New York]] in 1908, Fleischer worked for the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[New York Press]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; while studying at [[New York University]]. Then he served as the sports editor of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Press&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sun Press&amp;apos;&amp;apos; until 1929.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;boxingregister&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aA2LO_DGdu4C&amp;amp;pg=PA716|title=The Boxing Register: International Boxing Hall of Fame Official Record Book|date=October 1, 2006|author=James B. Roberts, Alexander G. Skutt|publisher=McBooks Press|page=716|accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He inaugurated in 1922, encouraged by [[Tex Rickard]], the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Ring (magazine)|Ring Magazine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; publication. In 1929 Fleischer acquired sole ownership of the magazine, which he led as editor in chief for fifty years, till his death in 1972.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;sportsillustrated&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1134974/index.htm/ Sports Illustrated article Mr. Boxing, Himself]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;boxingregister&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

In 1942, Fleischer began to publish the magazine&amp;apos;s annual [[Ring Record book and boxing encyclopedia|record book and boxing encyclopedia]],&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;sportsillustrated&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; which was published until 1987.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;boxingregister&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; In addition to that, Fleischer wrote several other books about the lives of some world champions and about boxing history.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;sportsillustrated&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;boxingregister&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

In 1954, General Pichai of [[Thailand]] invited Fleischer as a special guest to his homeland, as a way to ensure that the world championship bout between world Bantamweight champion [[Jimmy Carruthers]] of [[Australia]] and challenger [[Chamroen Songkitrat]] would follow the international boxing rules. It rained on the day of the fight, and 60,000 people were drenched by the rain. Fleischer suggested the fight be postponed and that they wait to see if the climate would get better the next day, but General Pichai ordered the bout to go on, reasoning that it would be hard to send off 60,000 people and the other thousands who were stranded outside back home under the pouring rain, to have them return the next day. Carruthers retained his crown by decision.

Fleischer also contributed to the founding of the [[Boxing Writers Association of America]] (BWAA) and was twice presented with its James J. Walker Award. After Fleischer&amp;apos;s death, the BWAA named an award after him. The accolades kept on coming, and Fleischer was inducted into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] in 1990.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;boxingregister&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
