A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;national trade union center&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a federation or confederation of [[trade union]]s in a single [[country]]. Nearly every country in the world has a national trade union center, and many have more than one. When there is more than one national center, it is often because of [[ideology|ideological]] differences—in some cases long-standing historic differences. In some regions, such as the [[Nordic countries]], different centers exist on a sectoral basis, for example for [[blue collar]] workers and [[professional]]s.

Among the larger national centers in the world are the [[American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations]] and the [[Change to Win Federation]] in the USA; the [[Canadian Labour Congress]]; the [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) in Britain; the [[Irish Congress of Trade Unions]]; the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] (ACTU); the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]]; the Dutch [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging|FNV]]; the [[LO, The Danish Confederation of Trade Unions|Danish]], [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions|Norwegian]], and [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation|Swedish LO]]; the German [[German Confederation of Trade Unions|DGB]]; the French [[Confédération Générale du Travail|CGT]] and [[CFDT]]; the Italian [[Italian Confederation of Workers&amp;apos; Trade Unions|CISL]], [[Italian General Confederation of Labour|CGIL]] and [[Italian Labour Union|UIL]]; the Japan Trade Union Confederation [[RENGO]]; the Argentinian [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|CGT]] and [[Argentine Workers&amp;apos; Center|CTA]]; the Brazilian [[Central Única dos Trabalhadores|CUT]], and so on.

Many national trade union centers are now members of the [[International Trade Union Confederation]], although some belong to the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]].
