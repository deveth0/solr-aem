The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;national emblem of [[Bangladesh]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-bn|বাংলাদেশের জাতীয় প্রতীক}}) was adopted shortly after independence in 1971.

Located on the emblem is a [[Nymphaea nouchali|water lily]], that is bordered on two sides by [[rice]] sheaves.  Above the water lilly are four [[star]]s and a three connected jute  leaves.  The water lily is the country&amp;apos;s national flower, and is representative of the many [[rivers]] that run through Bangladesh.  Rice represents its presence as the staple food of Bangladesh, and for the agriculture of that nation. The four stars represent the four founding principles that were originally enshrined in the first constitution of Bangladesh in 1972: nationalism, secularism, socialism, and democracy.

The details of the emblem is given as quoted below:
