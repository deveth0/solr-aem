&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nanoengineering&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the practice of [[engineering]] on the [[nanoscale]]. It derives its name from the [[nanometre]], a unit of measurement equalling one billionth of a meter.

Nanoengineering is largely a synonym for [[nanotechnology]], but emphasizes the engineering rather than the pure science aspects of the field.

==Degree programs==

{{Seealso|Nanotechnology education}}

The first nanoengineering program in the world was started at the [[University of Toronto]] within the Engineering Science program as one of the Options of study in the final years. In 2003, the [[Lund Institute of Technology]] started a program in Nanoengineering. In 2004, the [[College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering]](CNSE) was established on the campus of the [[University at Albany]].In 2005, the [[University of Waterloo]] established a unique program which offers a full degree in Nanotechnology Engineering. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web

}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Louisiana Tech University]] started the first program in the U.S. in 2005. In 2006 the [[University of Duisburg-Essen]] started a Bachelor and a Master program NanoEngineering. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web

In 2009, the [[University of Toronto]] began offering all Options of study in Engineering Science as degrees, bringing the second nanoengineering degree to Canada.
DTU Nanotech - the Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology - is a department at the [[Technical University of Denmark]] established in 1990.

== Techniques ==

* [[Scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) - Can be used to both image, and to manipulate structures as small as a single atom.
* [[Molecular self-assembly]] - Arbitrary sequences of [[DNA]] can now be synthesized cheaply in bulk, and used to create custom proteins or regular patterns of amino acids. Similarly, DNA strands can bind to other DNA strands, allowing simple structures to be created.
