&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nationwide Communications Inc.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a media subsidiary of the Nationwide Insurance Company, which operated from 1946 until 1997.  Based in [[Columbus, Ohio]], Nationwide Communications owned and operated a variety of radio and television stations across the [[United States]] until it sold off all its radio stations to [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]]-based [[Jacor]] for a reported $620 million, and its television stations to [[Young Broadcasting]]. The service division was spun off and became Nationwide Communications Services L.L.C. in 1998.

In 1946, the [[Ohio Farm Bureau Federation]] first got into broadcasting through a radio service for [[farmer]]s on [[WRFD]], Columbus, Ohio, an [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] station.  The Ohio Farm Bureau was dedicated to serving farmers in Ohio, but as its other pursuits (chiefly the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Insurance Company&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) were increasingly made available to non-farmers, the Farm Bureau spun off these ventures into a separate [[corporation]].  WRFD continued to serve farmers, and indeed, still carries farm programming today under the ownership of Salem Media of Ohio.  However, other Farm Bureau stations—most notably WRFD-FM, now known as [[WNCI]]—were transferred to this umbrella corporation, known today as the [[Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company|Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company &amp;amp; Affiliated Companies]].  The group of stations became known as Nationwide Communications, after its parent company.

Nationwide Communications owned four television stations.  Its first purchase in 1965 was [[WATE-TV]], Channel 6, [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].  The company&amp;apos;s second purchase was WXEX-TV (now [[WRIC-TV]]), Channel 8, [[Petersburg, Virginia]] in 1968, its third station was [[WBAY-TV]], Channel 2, [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], purchased in 1974, and its fourth station purchase was KITN (now [[WFTC]]), Channel 29, in [[Minneapolis]] in 1985.   Three of the four stations were [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliates (WXEX-TV switched from [[NBC]] to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1965, [[WATE-TV]] switched from [[NBC]] to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1979, and [[WBAY-TV]] switched from [[CBS]] to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1992); the fourth (KITN/WFTC) was an independent and later a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate while under Nationwide&amp;apos;s stewardship.  Nationwide Communications sold all three of its ABC-affiliated television stations in 1993 to [[Young Broadcasting]], a subsidiary of Adam Young, Incorporated, a TV station advertising representation firm; WFTC was sold to [[Clear Channel Communications]] the next year.

Before ceasing operations, Nationwide Communications was the 16th largest radio group in the United States and operated 17 stations in 8 different markets.  At the time the company ceased operations, Nationwide Communications owned [[KEGL]] and [[KDMX]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], [[KHMX]] and [[KTBZ-FM]] in [[Houston, Texas]], [[KZJK|KMJZ]] and [[KTNF|KSGS]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], [[KMXP|KGLQ]] and [[KZZP]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], [[KISW]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], [[KRQQ]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]], [[KSSX|KMCG]] and [[KMYI|KXGL]] in [[San Diego, California]], [[WPOC]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], [[WMMS]], [[WGAR-FM]], and [[WMJI]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and [[WYTS|WFII]], [[WCOL]], and [[WNCI]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]].
