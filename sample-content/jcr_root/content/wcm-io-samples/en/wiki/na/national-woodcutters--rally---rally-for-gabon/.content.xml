The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;National Woodcutters Rally&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Lang-fr|Rassemblement National des Bûcherons}}) is a [[political party]] in [[Gabon]]. It was founded in 1991 and led by Fr. [[Paul M&amp;apos;ba Abessole]].

The party is divided into two factions. A split occurred in July 1998 when [[Pierre-Andre Kombila]] founded the [[National Woodcutters&amp;apos; Rally - Democratic]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rassemblement national des Bûcherons - Démocratique&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). The main faction (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;National Woodcutters&amp;apos; Rally – Rally for Gabon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rassemblement national des Bûcherons -  Rassemblement pour le Gabon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, led by M&amp;apos;ba Abessole) has performed much better in elections than the RNB-D, and is considered the main party.

In the [[Gabonese legislative election, 2001|9 December 2001 parliamentary election]], the party won 8 out of 120 seats. In the [[Gabonese legislative election, 2006|17 December/24 December 2006 parliamentary election]], the party won 8 out of 120 seats.

Although the RNB constituted the main opposition to President [[Omar Bongo]] during the 1990s&amp;amp;mdash;M&amp;apos;ba Abessole officially placed second in the [[Gabonese presidential election, 1993|1993 presidential election]]&amp;amp;mdash;both factions are currently part of the Presidential Majority supporting Bongo. M&amp;apos;ba Abessole has served in the government since January 2002.
