The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;National Liberal Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (NLP, {{lang-ar|حزب الوطنيين الأحرار}}, literally &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ḥizb Al-Waṭaniyyīn Al-Aḥrār&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[center-right]] [[political party]] in [[Lebanon]], established by [[President of Lebanon|President]] [[Camille Chamoun]] in 1958. It is now under the leadership of [[Dory Chamoun]], his son.

==Policies==
The party has adopted a hard line in regard to the preservation of Lebanese [[independence]], and to the safeguard of the distinctive [[Liberalism|liberal]] practices in Lebanon with respect to [[freedom of expression]] and [[freedom of speech|opinion]] and [[religious freedom]]s. Like most Lebanese political organization, it has a sectarian basis; the NLP is mainly supported by [[Christian]]s. (For more information on this, see [[Demographics of Lebanon]])

==History==
In 1968, the party joined The [[Helf Alliance]] formed with the two other big mainly [[Christian]] parties in Lebanon: the [[Kataeb]] of [[Pierre Gemayel]], and [[Lebanese National Bloc|National Bloc]] of [[Raymond Eddé]]. During the [[Lebanese Civil War]] of 1975-90, the NLP was aligned with the mainly [[Maronite]] [[Christian]] alliance who fought the [[Lebanese National Movement]] (LNM). It had its own armed militia, the [[Tigers Militia (Lebanon)|Tigers]]. In 1976, the NLP joined with the [[Kataeb Party]] (Phalange) and the [[Lebanese Renewal Party]] (LRP) to form the [[Lebanese Front]], a political coalition. This was paralleled by the joining of the militias under a central command, the [[Lebanese Forces]], headed by Phalange leader [[Bashir Gemayel]]. In 1980, Gemayel turned on the Tigers, and in a [[Day of the Long Knives (Beirut)|surprise attack in Safra]] eliminated the militia. The NLP has survived as a party, however. Nevertheless, with the death of [[Camille Chamoun]] in 1987 and the assassination of his successor and son [[Dany Chamoun|Dany]] in 1990, combined with the rise of the [[Lebanese Forces]] as political party, it seems that the NLP&amp;apos;s political influence has considerably declined comparing to the 1960s and 1970s.

In 2005 the NLP was part of the [[Qornet Shehwan Gathering]], opposed to the [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon]], but later left because of what it alleged was &amp;quot;corruption&amp;quot; in this gathering.
