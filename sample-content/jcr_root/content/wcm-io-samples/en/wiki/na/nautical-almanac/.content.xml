A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;nautical almanac&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a publication describing the positions of a selection of [[celestial bodies]] for the purpose of enabling navigators to use [[celestial navigation]] to determine the position of their ship while at sea. The Almanac specifies for each whole hour of the year the position on the Earth&amp;apos;s surface (in [[declination]] and [[Greenwich meridian|Greenwich]] [[hour angle]]) at which the [[sun]], [[moon]], [[planet]]s and [[first point of Aries]] is directly overhead. The positions of 57 selected [[star]]s are specified relative to the [[first point of Aries]].

In [[Great Britain]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Nautical Almanac]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has been published annually by [[HM Nautical Almanac Office]], ever since the first edition was published in 1767.

In the [[United States of America]], a nautical almanac has been published annually by the [[US Naval Observatory]] since 1852.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;USNO almanac history&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  Since 1958, the USNO and HMNAO have jointly published a unified nautical almanac, for use by the navies of both countries.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;USNO almanac history&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  Almanac data is now available online from the US Naval Observatory.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;USNO celnavdata&amp;quot;&amp;gt;

Also commercial almanacs were produced that combined other information. A good example would be Brown&amp;apos;s — which commenced in 1877 – and is still produced annually, its early twentieth century subtitle being &amp;quot;Harbour and Dock Guide and Advertiser and Daily Tide Tables&amp;quot;.  This combination of trade advertising, and information &amp;quot;by permission... of the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office|Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty]]&amp;quot; provided a useful compendium of information.  More recent editions have kept up with the changes in technology – the 1924 edition for instance had extensive advertisements for coaling stations.

The &amp;quot;Air Almanac&amp;quot; of the United States and Great Britain tabulates celestial coordinates for 10 minute intervals for the use in aerial navigation.  The [[Sokkia]] Corporation&amp;apos;s annual &amp;quot;Celestial Observation Handbook and Ephemeris&amp;quot; tabulated daily celestial coordinates (to a tenth of an arcsecond) for the Sun and nine stars; it was last published for 2008.

To find the position of a ship or aircraft by [[celestial navigation]], the navigator measures with a [[sextant]] the apparent height of a celestial body above the horizon, and notes the time from a [[marine chronometer]].  That height is compared with the height predicted for a trial position; the arcminutes of height difference is how many nautical miles the position line is from the trial position.
