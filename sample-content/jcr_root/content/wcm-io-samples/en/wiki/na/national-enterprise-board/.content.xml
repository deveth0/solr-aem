        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;National Enterprise Board&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;NEB&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was a [[United Kingdom|UK]] government body.

==History==
The National Enterprise Board was set up in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1975 to implement the [[Harold_Wilson#Second_term_as_Prime_Minister_.281974.E2.80.931976.29|Wilson Labour government]]&amp;apos;s objective of extending [[public ownership]] of [[economy of the United Kingdom|industry]]. The plans were outlined in the 1974 [[White Paper]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Regeneration of British Industry&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Industry Act 1975&amp;apos;&amp;apos; enacted these measures, establishing the NEB.

One of the first activities of the NEB was the [[Ryder Report (British Leyland)|Ryder Report]], named for the NEB&amp;apos;s new chairman, on the future of the [[British Leyland Motor Corporation]].

After the Conservative Party took power in 1979 under Margaret Thatcher&amp;apos;s leadership, the NEB&amp;apos;s powers began to be eroded. The last Labour-appointed chairman of the NEB was Sir Leslie Murphy, who resigned with his entire board when Sir Keith Joseph (the new industry minister) decided to remove its responsibility for the government&amp;apos;s holding in Rolls-Royce.

The next chairman was Sir Arthur Knight who was content to lose a number of companies, but strongly supported the [[Inmos]] microchip project. However he eventually became frustrated by the government and resigned in November 1980. He was succeeded by his deputy, Sir John King (now Lord King of Wartnaby), who proceeded, with some vigour, to dismantle most of the board&amp;apos;s remaining activities.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Obituary - 2003 Sir Arthur Knight&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.64-baker-street.org/obituaries/obit_2003_arthur_knight.html| title =  Obituary - 2003 Sir Arthur Knight}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The NEB had a software initiative called INSAC. The [[computer memory|memory]] and [[microprocessor]] company [[Inmos]] was set up by the NEB in 1978.

In 1981, the NEB was combined with the [[National Research Development Corporation]] (NRDC) to form the [[British Technology Group]] (BTG). The NRDC had been founded in 1948 by [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|Attlee&amp;apos;s Labour government]] to commercialise British publicly funded research.

In 1991 BTG was transferred to the [[private sector]] and, as [[BTG]] plc, has become a leading technology transfer company that commercialises [[intellectual property]] acquired from research organisations and companies around the world.
