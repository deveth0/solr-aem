The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;National Republicans&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were a [[Political parties in the United States|political party in the United States]]. During the administration of [[John Quincy Adams]] (1825–1829), the president&amp;apos;s supporters were referred to as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Adams Men&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anti-Jackson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  When [[Andrew Jackson]] was elected [[President of the United States]] in 1828, this group went into opposition. The use of the term &amp;quot;National Republican&amp;quot; dates from 1830.

Before the elevation of [[John Quincy Adams]] to the presidency in 1825, the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which had been the only national American political party for over a decade, began to fracture, losing its infrastructure and identity. Its caucuses no longer met to select candidates because now they had separate interests. After the [[Election of 1824]], factions developed in support of Adams and in support of [[Andrew Jackson]]. Adams politicians, including most ex-[[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]] (such as [[Daniel Webster]] and even Adams himself), would gradually evolve into the National Republican party, and those politicians that supported Jackson would later help form the modern [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ad hoc&amp;apos;&amp;apos; coalition that supported John Quincy Adams fell apart after his defeat for reelection in 1828. The main opposition to Jackson, the new president, was the National Republican Party, or Anti-Jacksonians created and run by [[Henry Clay]]. It shared the same nationalistic outlook as the Adamsites, and wanted to use national resources to build a strong economy.  Its platform was Clay&amp;apos;s [[American System (economic plan)|American System]] of nationally financed [[internal improvements]] and a protective tariff, which would promote faster economic development. More important, by binding together the diverse interests of the different regions, the party intended to promote national unity and harmony. The National Republicans saw the Union as a corporate, organic whole. Hence the rank and file idealized Clay for his comprehensive perspective on the national interest. Conversely, they disdained those they identified as &amp;quot;party&amp;quot; politicians for [[pandering (politics)|pandering]] to local interests at the expense of the national interest.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Brown, p20.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The party met in national convention in late 1831 and nominated Clay for the presidency and [[John Sergeant (politician)|John Sergeant]] for the vice presidency. The [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] emerged in 1833–34 after Clay&amp;apos;s defeat as a coalition of National Republicans, along with [[Anti-Masonic Party|Anti-Masons]], disaffected Jacksonians, and people whose last political activity was with the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]] a decade before. In the short term, it formed the Whig party with the help of other smaller parties in a coalition against President Jackson and his reforms.
