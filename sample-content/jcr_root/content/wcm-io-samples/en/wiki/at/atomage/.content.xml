&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AtomAge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; magazine (later &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AtomAge International&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; magazine) was a [[fetish magazine]] published in Britain by the clothes designer [[John Sutcliffe (designer)|John Sutcliffe]] in the 1970s as an offshoot of his AtomAge fetish clothing business.  The first AtomAge clothing catalogue was published in 1965; the first issue of the magazine in A5 format was published in 1972 remaining in print until 1980. The magazine specialized in [[leather fetishism|leather]], [[rubber and PVC fetishism]], with a heavy emphasis on rubber and leather [[catsuit]]s, [[cloak]]s, and [[gasmask]]s. In 1981, the publication was split in two: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AtomAge Rubberist&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (similar to the original &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AtomAge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AtomAge Bondage&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (which contained more overtly [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;amp;M]] content).  [[John Sutcliffe (designer)|Sutcliffe]] made this decision because the [[Bondage (BDSM)|Bondage]] material he began to introduce in the late 1970s issues of the original &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AtomAge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; bothered some rubber enthusiasts. Both magazines remained in print until 1985.

One of Sutcliffe&amp;apos;s main goals was to dignify the popular perception of fetish. He is regarded as one of the patron saints of the world-wide Rubberist community as a result.

2010 sees the publication of Dressing For Pleasure, The Best Of AtomAge, a comprehensive hardback book celebrating the imagery and life of this highly influential magazine and company.  &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2010/sep/11/john-sutcliffe-fetish-wear&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
