&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;At Action Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the first full length record by [[Shellac (band)|Shellac]], released in 1994. The title has nothing to do with the infamous New Jersey theme park, [[Action Park]], which closed in 1996 due to numerous fatalities. The drummer, Todd Trainer, came up with the title of the fictional park because it sounded cool. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Packaging==
The release came in a folded and hand-pressed sleeve which is referred as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;uni-pak style album jacket&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The inner sleeve shows artwork with four microphones, the record sleeve shows an illustration of the fictional Action Park on one side, and a lengthy medical text &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Resuscitation from apparent death by electric shock&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on the other side (the text was found in an old electronics textbook of Weston&amp;apos;s). The Vinyl had inscriptions in the run-out groove of both sides, reading: &amp;quot;Smoking is as natural as breathing. They&amp;apos;ve been doing it since before I was born... ... which is a shame, because I could have invented it. - Todd Stanford Trainer 1994&amp;quot;
