In [[Māori mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Atutahi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the name of Canopus, ([[Alpha Carinae]]).
Atutahi is the second brightest star in the night-time sky, second only to Sirius (Takurua).
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aotahi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Autahi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Atutahi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;First-light&amp;quot;  or &amp;quot;Single-light&amp;quot;, were equivalent names that also intimated the star&amp;apos;s solitary or self-centered nature.

Atutahi is considered to be very [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] star,  and always dwells alone. This is seen in its position outside the Milky Way.

Of all the stars known to the Māori, Atutahi had a special place, along with Rigel ([[Puanga]]), because of their intimate association with [[Sweet potato|kūmara]] cultivation. Their appearance in the eastern sky was the sign for planting to begin.
Atutahi and Puanga could be used to foretell the weather.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Best 1955: pp38,42,48&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Tregear 1891: p31&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Atutahi has several different mythologies attached to it as well. One story tells of how Atutahi was left outside of the basket representing the [[Milky Way]] when [[Tane]] wove it. Another related myth surrounding the star says that Autahi was the first-born child of [[Rangi and Papa|Rangi]], who refused to enter the Milky Way and so turned it sideways and rose before it. The same name is used for other stars and constellations throughout Polynesia.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Makemson 1941:pp200-202&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
