In [[telecommunication]], an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;atmospheric duct&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a horizontal layer in the lower atmosphere in which the vertical [[refractive index]] gradients are such that [[radio]] signals (and light rays) (a) are guided or ducted, (b) tend to follow the curvature of the Earth, and (c) experience less [[attenuation]] in the ducts than they would if the ducts were not present. The duct acts as an atmospheric [[dielectric]] [[waveguide]] and limits the spread of the [[wavefront]] to only the horizontal dimension.&amp;lt;ref name = &amp;quot;isbn0-19-509161-2&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Atmospheric ducting&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a mode of [[Radio propagation|propagation]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]], usually in the lower layers of [[Earth’s atmosphere]], where the waves are bent by atmospheric [[refraction]].&amp;lt;ref name=NTRP1-02&amp;gt;{{cite book

In [[over-the-horizon radar]], ducting causes part of the radiated and target-reflection energy of a radar system to be guided over distances far greater than the normal radar range. It also causes long distance propagation of [[radio]] signals in bands that would normally be limited to line of sight.

Normally radio &amp;quot;[[ground wave]]s&amp;quot; propagate along the surface as [[creeping wave]]s.  That is, they are only [[diffraction|diffracted]] around the curvature of the earth.  This is one reason that early long distance radio communication used long wavelengths.  The best known exception is that HF (3–30&amp;amp;nbsp;MHz.) waves are reflected by the [[ionosphere]].

The reduced refractive index due to lower densities at the higher altitudes in the [[Earth&amp;apos;s atmosphere]] bends the signals back toward the Earth. Signals in a higher refractive index layer, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;i.e.,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; duct, tend to remain in that layer because of the [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]] encountered at the boundary with a lower refractive index material. In some [[weather]] conditions, such as [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion layer]]s, density changes so rapidly that waves are guided around the curvature of the earth at constant altitude.

Phenomena of atmospheric optics related to atmospheric ducting include the [[green flash]], [[Fata Morgana (mirage)|Fata Morgana]], superior [[mirage]], mock [[mirage of astronomical objects]] and the [[Novaya Zemlya effect]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;isbn0-19-509161-2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas, Michael Frederic |title=Optical propagation in linear media: atmospheric gases and particles, solid state components, and water |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2006 |pages= 327–328|isbn=0-19-509161-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
