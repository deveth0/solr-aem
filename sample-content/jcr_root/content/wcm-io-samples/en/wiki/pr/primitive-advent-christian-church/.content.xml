The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Primitive Advent Christian Church&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small body of [[Adventist]] [[Christianity|Christians]] which separated from the [[Advent Christian Church]]. They have a common early history. Adventists who had adopted the &amp;quot;conditional immortality&amp;quot; views of Charles F. Hudson and George Storrs formed the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Advent Christian Association&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] in 1860.

Like [[Primitive Baptist]]s, and [[Primitive Methodist]]s the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Primitive Advent Christian Church&amp;apos;&amp;apos; uses the modifier &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Primitive&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to signify the idea that they represent the original teachings of the church. They differ from the parent body mainly in two points. They observe [[feet washing]] as a rite of the church, and they teach that reclaimed backsliders should be baptized (even though they had formerly been baptized). This is sometimes referred to as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;rebaptism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Officers in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Primitive Advent Christian Church&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are pastors, elders and deacons. A conference for church business is conducted annually.

The church had 427 members in 9 congregations in 1990, all of which were located in central [[West Virginia]].
