&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Production equipment control&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; involves production equipment that resides in the [[shop floor]] of a manufacturing company and its purpose is to produce goods of a wanted [[Quality (business)|quality]] when provided with [[production resource]]s of a required quality. In modern [[production line]]s the production equipment is fully automated using [[industrial control method]]s and involves limited [[unskilled labour]] participation. Modern production equipment consists of [[mechatronic]] modules that are integrated according to a [[control architecture]]. The most widely known architectures involve [[hierarchy]], [[polyarchy]], [[hetaerarchy]] and hybrid. The methods for achieving a [[technical effect]] are described by [[control algorithm]]s, which may or may not utilize [[formal method]]s in their design.
