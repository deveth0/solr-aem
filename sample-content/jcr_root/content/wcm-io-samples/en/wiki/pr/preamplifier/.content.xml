[[Image:Musicfirstaudioclassicpreamplifier.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a typical [[high-end]] [[stereo]] preamplifier.]]

A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;preamplifier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (preamp) is an [[electronic amplifier]] that prepares a small electrical [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] for further amplification or processing. A preamplifier is often placed close to the [[sensor]] to reduce the effects of [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] and [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]]. It is used to boost the signal strength to drive the cable to the main instrument without significantly degrading the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR). The noise performance of a preamplifier is critical; according to [[Friis formulas for noise|Friis&amp;apos;s formula]], when the gain of the preamplifier is high, the SNR of the final signal is determined by the SNR of the input signal and the [[noise figure]] of the preamplifier.

In a home [[audio system]], the term &amp;apos;preamplifier&amp;apos; may sometimes be used to describe equipment which merely [[switch]]es between different [[line level]] sources and applies a [[attenuation|volume control]], so that no actual amplification may be involved. In an audio system, the second amplifier is typically a [[power amplifier]] (power amp).  The preamplifier provides [[voltage]] gain (e.g. from 10 millivolts to 1 volt) but no significant [[Electric current|current]] gain. The power amplifier provides the higher current necessary to drive [[loudspeakers]].

Preamplifiers may be:
* incorporated into the housing or chassis of the amplifier they feed
* in a separate housing
* mounted within or near the signal source, such as a turntable, microphone or [[musical instrument]].

Preamplifier Types:
Three basic types of preamplifiers are available: the current-sensitive preamplifier, the parasitic-capacitance preamplifier, and the
[[charge amplifier|charge-sensitive preamplifier]].

== Examples ==


* The integrated preamplifier in a foil [[electret]] microphone.
* The first stages of an [[instrument amplifier]], which is then sent to the power amplifier. With instrument amplifiers, the preamp is often designed to produce [[distortion (music)|overdrive]] or distortion effects (listen to the [[James Cotton]] sound clip on the right to hear the sound of an overdriven guitar preamp).
* A stand-alone unit for use in [[live music]] and [[recording studio]] applications.
* As part of a stand-alone [[channel strip]] or channel strip built into an audio [[mixing desk]].
* A [[Radio masts and towers|masthead]] amplifier used with [[television]] receiver [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] or a [[satellite]] [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] dish.
* The circuit inside of a hard drive connected to the magnetic heads or the circuit inside of CD/DVD drive which connects to the [[photodiode]]s.
* A [[switched capacitor]] circuit used to null the effects of mismatch offset in most [[CMOS]] comparator-based flash [[analog-to-digital converter]]s
