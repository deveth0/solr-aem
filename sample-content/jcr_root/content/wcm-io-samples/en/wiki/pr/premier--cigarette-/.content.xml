&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Premier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a smokeless [[cigarette]] released in the United States in 1988 by the [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]]. It worked by heating and aerosolizing tobacco flavour and was intended to reduce or eliminate the unhealthy side effects associated with smoking, both to the smoker and to [[Passive smoking|the people around the smoker]].{{cn|date=July 2012}}

The project took several years to develop at a cost of more than $1 billion.{{cn|date=July 2012}}

While RJR itself questioned whether the device functioned adequately as a [[nicotine]] delivery device, activists derided it for its potential for use in delivery of other drugs.{{cn|date=July 2012}} It never achieved popularity, as smokers complained about a [[charcoal]]-like aftertaste, and although it looked like a conventional cigarette, special instructions were required to teach smokers how to light it. RJR estimated that it would take two or three packs for a smoker to acquire a taste for Premier, but in practice many smokers only smoked one cigarette and shared the rest of the pack. It was withdrawn from the market in 1989, less than a year after its introduction.

R.J. Reynolds reintroduced the concept behind the Premier cigarette as the [[Eclipse (cigarette)|Eclipse]] brand in the 1990s.
