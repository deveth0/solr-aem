        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Presidential Cup Game&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Presidential Cup Bowl&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was a postseason [[American football|American]] [[college football]] bowl game played at [[Byrd Stadium]] in [[College Park, Maryland]], on December 9, 1950 between Texas A&amp;amp;M University and University of Georgia.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Foldesy, Jody. &amp;quot;Bowls burgeon as big business&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Washington Times&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. December 21, 1997. Page A1.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Entering the game==
The Aggies, coached by [[Harry Stiteler]], entered the contest with a 6-4 record. A&amp;amp;M had posted victories over Nevada, Texas Tech, VMI, TCU, Arkansas, and SMU; while dropping contests against Oklahoma, Baylor, Rice, and Texas. The game was A&amp;amp;M&amp;apos;s first post-season appearance since a 19-14 defeat at the hands of LSU in the 1944 Orange Bowl. Having posted records of 0-9-1 and 1-8-1 in his first two seasons in College Station, the 1950 season marked a huge turn-around for Stiteler&amp;apos;s program. The victory over Georgia, however, was to mark the end of his tenure at A&amp;amp;M.

Meanwhile in Athens, Coach Wally Butts&amp;apos; Bulldogs had scratched out a 6-2-3 record. The Red &amp;amp; Black enjoyed victories over Maryland, Mississippi State, Boston College, Florida, Auburn, and Furman; fought to ties with Saint Mary&amp;apos;s, North Carolina, and LSU; and lost 14-7 against Alabama, and 7-0 to Georgia Tech. The trip to College Park was Georgia&amp;apos;s 7th bowl venture, and would be UGA&amp;apos;s first December bowl outing.
