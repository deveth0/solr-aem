        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Preston&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] about {{convert|3|mi|km}} south of [[Hitchin]] in [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]].

The village grew up around the [[Knights Templar|Templar]] holdings at [[Temple Dinsley]], and [[Princess Helena College]] is now on the site. The first church was mentioned in 1252, when six acres (24,000&amp;amp;nbsp;mÂ²) of land was given to nuns from [[Elstow]], [[Bedfordshire]].

Temple Dinsley passed on to the [[Knights Hospitaller]] after the dissolution of the Templars. When the Hospitallers were in turn dissolved in 1542, the manor went to Sir [[Ralph Sadleir]].

In the 17th century the village became linked with [[John Bunyan]], who used to hold services in a natural [[amphitheatre]] now called Bunyan&amp;apos;s Dell.

St Martin&amp;apos;s, the local [[Anglican]] [[church (building)|church]], opened in 1900.

The ruined [[Minsden Chapel]], reputed to be haunted, is located near the village, though is actually in [[Langley, Hertfordshire|Langley]] civil parish.
