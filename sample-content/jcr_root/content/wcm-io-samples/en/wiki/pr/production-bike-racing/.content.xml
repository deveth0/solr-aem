&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Production Bike Racing&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a form of [[Motorcycle racing]] that involves racing [[motorcycle]]s virtually unmodified from those that can be bought in shops and then ridden on public highways.

The most common subcategory is the 250 cc production bike class, in which &amp;quot;race-replica&amp;quot; motorcycles that superficially resemble Grand Prix machines but have engines capable of meeting legal and reliability requirements for street use, have their road equipment ripped off and are raced.

Because each bike offers virtually identical performance, and because they are relatively cheap to buy and race, it is a popular introductory racing category, particularly in [[Australia]].
