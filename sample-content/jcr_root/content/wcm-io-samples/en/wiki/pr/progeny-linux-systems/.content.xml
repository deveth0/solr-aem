&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Progeny Componentized Linux&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, usually called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Progeny Debian&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a defunct free [[operating system]]. Progeny announced in a post to its various mailing lists on 1 May 2007 that they were ceasing operations, and shut down their website.

Progeny Debian was an alternative to Debian 3.1. Furthermore, it was based upon the [[Linux Standard Base]] (LSB) 3.0, adopting technology such as the [[Anaconda installer]] ported from Red Hat, [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]], and Discover. Progeny Debian aimed to be a model for developing a component-based Linux.
