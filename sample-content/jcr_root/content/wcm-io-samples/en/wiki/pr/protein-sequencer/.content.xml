A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;protein sequencer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a machine that is used to determine the sequence of [[amino acid]]s in a [[protein]].

They work by tagging and removing one amino acid at a time&amp;lt;!--how? by chemicals? what are these chemicals designed to do--&amp;gt;, which is analysed and identified. This is done repetitively for the whole [[polypeptide]], until the whole sequence is established.

This method has generally been replaced by [[nucleic acid]] technology, and it is often easier to identify the sequence of a protein by looking at the [[DNA]] that codes for it.
