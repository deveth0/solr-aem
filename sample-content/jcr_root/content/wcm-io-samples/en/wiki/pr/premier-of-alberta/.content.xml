The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Premier of Alberta&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the [[first minister]] for the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Provinces of Canada|province]] of [[Alberta]]. He or she is the province&amp;apos;s [[head of government]] and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;de facto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; chief executive. The current Premier of Alberta is [[Alison Redford]]. She became Premier by winning the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative]] leadership elections on October 2, 2011. Redford replaced [[Ed Stelmach]], who retired after serving as Premier for over four years.

The Premier of the province deals with specific areas relating to Alberta and Alberta&amp;apos;s relation on the national scene. The Premier acts as a representative for the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] and the [[Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLA) are in turn the representatives of the people of Alberta. The Premier also acts as the MLA for a [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]], and are elected as the MLA by the constituents of that particular riding. As with most government leaders in a [[parliamentary system]], the Premier usually wins his or her riding&amp;apos;s election quite easily. However, some Premiers have not won their seat, forcing them to run in a by-election in another riding. The most recent case of this was [[Don Getty]], who lost his [[Edmonton-Whitemud]] seat in the [[Alberta general election, 1989|1989 election]] and had to run in [[Drumheller-Stettler]].

The Premier of Alberta&amp;apos;s responsibilities include administering provincial [[laws]], enacting [[legislation]], and regulating industry. The Premier is responsible for promoting Alberta&amp;apos;s interests via the federal government and serves as the chief representative of Alberta to the rest of Canada.
