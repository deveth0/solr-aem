        text="&lt;p&gt;[[Image:prophage SVG.svg|225px|thumb|Formation of a prophage]]A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;prophage&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[phage]] (viral) [[genome]] inserted and integrated into the circular bacterial DNA chromosome or existing as an extrachromosomal [[plasmid]]. This is a latent form of a [[phage|bacteriophage]], in which the viral genes are present in the [[bacteria|bacterium]] without causing disruption of the bacterial [[cell (biology)|cell]].

Upon detection of host cell damage, such as UV light or certain chemicals, the prophage is excised from the bacterial chromosome in a process called prophage induction. After induction, viral replication begins via the [[lytic cycle]]. In the lytic cycle, the virus commandeers the cell&amp;apos;s reproductive machinery. The cell may fill with new viruses until it lyses or bursts, or it may release the new viruses one at a time in a reverse endocytotic process. The period from infection to lysis is termed the latent period. A virus following a lytic cycle is called a virulent virus. Prophages are important agents of [[horizontal gene transfer]], and are considered part of the [[mobilome]]. All families of bacterial viruses with circular (single-stranded or double-stranded) DNA genomes or replicating their genomes through a circular intermediate (e.g., [[Caudovirales]]) have temperate members.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|title=Genomics of bacterial and archaeal viruses: dynamics within the prokaryotic virosphere|journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev|year=2011|volume=75|issue=4|pages=610-635|doi=10.1128/MMBR.00011-11|pmid=22126996|author=Krupovic M, Prangishvili D, Hendrix RW, Bamford DH|pmc=3232739}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Zygotic induction==

{{Main|Zygotic induction}}

If a target cell doesn&amp;apos;t have the same prophage, upon infection by a phage the lytic pathway is immediately activated. This phenomenon is called [[Zygotic induction]].
