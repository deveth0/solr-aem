&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Private banks&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are banks owned by either an individual or a general [[Partner (business rank)|partner(s)]] with limited partner(s). Private banks are not [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]]. In any such case, the creditors can look to both the &amp;quot;entirety of the bank&amp;apos;s assets&amp;quot; as well as the entirety of the sole-proprietor&amp;apos;s/general-partners&amp;apos; assets.

These banks have a long tradition in [[Switzerland]], dating back to at least the [[Revocation_of_the_Edict_of_Nantes#The_Revocation_of_the_Edict_of_Nantes|Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] (1685). Private banks also have a long tradition in the UK where [[C. Hoare &amp;amp; Co|C. Hoare &amp;amp; Co.]] has been in business since 1672.

There were many private banks in Europe, but most have now become incorporated companies, so the term is rarely true any more. Today, the term &amp;quot;private bank&amp;quot; can also refer to the financial institution specializing in financial advice and services for [[high-net-worth individual]]s ([[private banking]]).

&amp;quot;Private banks&amp;quot; can also refer to non-government owned banks in general, in contrast to government-owned (or nationalized) banks, which were prevalent in [[communist]], [[socialist]] and some [[social democratic]] states in the 20th century.
