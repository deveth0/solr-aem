A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;priory&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[monastery]] of men or women under religious vows that is headed by a [[prior]] or prioress.  Priories may be houses of [[mendicant]] [[friar]]s  or religious sisters (as the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Augustinian Hermits|Augustinians]], [[Franciscans]], and [[Carmelites]], for instance), or [[monastery|monasteries]] of [[monk]]s or [[nun]]s (as the [[Benedictines]]). Houses of [[canon regular|canons regular and canonesses regular]] also use this term, the alternative being &amp;quot;canonry&amp;quot;.

Priories first came to existence in Britain in the physical sense as subsidiaries to the [[Cluny Abbey|Abbey of Cluny]]. Many new houses were formed that were all subservient to the abbey of Cluny and called Priories. As such, the priory came to represent the [[Benedictine]] ideals espoused by the [[Cluniac reforms]] as smaller, lesser houses of Benedictines of Cluny. Many such houses were formed, all as subsidiaries of Cluny and seem to have clouded the monastic evolution of England in name.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The [[Benedictines]] and their offshoots ([[Cistercians]] and [[Trappists]] among them), the [[Premonstratensians]], and the [[military orders]] distinguish between &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;conventual&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and simple or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;obedientiary&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; priories. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Conventual priories&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are those autonomous houses which have no [[abbot]]s, either because the canonically required number of twelve monks has not yet been reached, or for some other reason. At present the Benedictine Order has twenty-seven conventual priories. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Simple&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;obedientiary priories&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are dependencies of [[abbey]]s. Their superior, who is subject to the [[abbot]] in everything, is called a &amp;quot;prior.&amp;quot; These monasteries are satellites of the mother abbey. The [[Cluniac order]] is notable for being organised entirely on this obedientiary principle, with a single abbot at the [[Abbey of Cluny]], and all other houses dependent priories.

Priory may also refer to schools operated or sponsored by the [[Benedictines]], such as the [[Saint Louis Priory School]] or the [[Woodside Priory School]].  Priory is also used to refer to the geographic headquarters of several [[Commandry (feudalism)|commanderies]] of [[knight]]s.
