&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Prospect of Whitby&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a historic [[public house]] on the banks of the [[river Thames|Thames]] at [[Wapping]] in the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]]. It lays claim to being the site of the oldest riverside [[tavern]], dating from around 1520. It was formerly known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Devil’s Tavern&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, on account of its dubious reputation. Before that it was officially called &amp;quot;The Pelican&amp;quot;. All that remains from the building’s earliest period is the 400 year old stone floor. In former times it was a meeting place for [[sailor]]s, [[smuggler]]s, cut-throats and [[footpad]]s. [[Hugh Willoughby (sea captain)|Sir Hugh Willoughby]] sailed from here in 1533 in a disastrous attempt to discover the [[North-East Passage]] to [[China]].

In the 17th century, it became the hostelry of choice of &amp;quot;[[Hanging]]&amp;quot; [[Judge Jeffreys]], scourge of the [[Monmouth Rebellion]]. He lived nearby and a noose hangs by a window, commemorating his custom. He was chased by anti-Royalists into the nearby &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Town of Ramsgate&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, captured and taken to the [[Tower of London|Tower]] for his own safety. According to legend, criminals would be tied up to the posts at low tide and left there to drown when the tide came in. [[Execution Dock]] was actually by Wapping Old Stairs and generally used for pirates.&amp;lt;ref name=brit&amp;gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=45082 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Thames Tunnel, Ratcliff Highway and Wapping,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Old and New London: Volume 2 (1878), pp. 128-37] Retrieved 29 March 2007&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Views from the pub were sketched by both [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] and [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]]. Writers [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Samuel Pepys]] are known to have paused to sup here.&amp;lt;ref name=brit/&amp;gt;

Following a fire in the early 19th century, the tavern was rebuilt and renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Prospect of Whitby&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, after a Tyne [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] that used to berth next to the pub. The Prospect was [[listed building|listed Grade II]] in December 1950.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{IoE|206332}} accessed 9 December 2008&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On the opposite side of the road ([[Wapping Wall]]) is the [[Wapping Hydraulic Power Station]], now an arts centre and restaurant.

The public house features briefly in an episode of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Only Fools And Horses]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. When Uncle Albert goes missing in one episode, Del Boy and Rodney travel around London looking for him. [[Nicholas Lyndhurst]] is shown in one scene walking out of the pub. There is also a scene from the 1956 film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[D-Day the Sixth of June]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; starring [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] and [[Richard Todd]] where Taylor&amp;apos;s character is seen with [[Dana Wynter]]&amp;apos;s character having drinks together during the [[Second World War]] in London.

In the comic book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Mina Harker]] pauses in front of the public house and says it brings back memories. She is referring to the beaching of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Demeter&amp;apos;&amp;apos; at [[Whitby]] in the novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dracula]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

This pub is also featured in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Jean Bruller|Vercors]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s novel Les Animaux dénaturés (translated variously into English as You Shall Know Them, Borderline, and The Murder of the Missing Link).
