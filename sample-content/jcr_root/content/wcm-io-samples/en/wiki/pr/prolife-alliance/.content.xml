        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ProLife Alliance&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or simply &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ProLife&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is an advocacy group in the [[United Kingdom]], formed in October 1996. It is opposed to any form of [[euthanasia]] and opposes human [[cloning]], [[abortion]] and experiments on human [[embryo]]s. It supports anti-abortion taxation policies and guaranteed maternity and paternity leave. Its leader is Dominica Roberts.

Originally formed as a political party, it put up 50 candidates to contest the 1997 election. The refusal of the [[BBC]] to show its television broadcast led to litigation, in which it was ultimately unsuccessful - [http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/ld200203/ldjudgmt/jd030515/bbc-1.htm  Regina v. British Broadcasting Corporation (Appellants) ex parte Prolife Alliance].

The ProLife Alliance gained 20,000 votes in the [[European Parliament election, 2004]]. It withdrew from the Electoral Commission&amp;apos;s Register in 2004.

In 2003 the Department of Health (DOH) significantly reduced the statistical information it provided about abortions for suspected foetal abnormalities. The ProLife Alliance challenged this under the [[Freedom of Information Act]], and this challenge was supported by the [[Information Commissioner]]. An appeal by the DOH to the Information Tribunal [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8309432.stm  failed]. The Tribunal rejected the DOH view that personal information would be unreasonably endangered, and commented on the Department&amp;apos;s duty to ensure compliance with the Abortion Act and its failure to scrutinise reporting forms &amp;quot;either clinically or substantively&amp;quot; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.informationtribunal.gov.uk/DBFiles/Decision/i344/DOH%20v%20IC%20and%20PLA%20(EA-2008-0074)%20Decision%2015-10-09%20(w).pdf  Tribunal Decision], October 2009, paras 81,82).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The Department first planned to [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/6556815/Government-seeks-secrecy-on-cleft-palate-abortions.html  appeal] to the High Court, but subsequently conceded and made the requested information available in July 2011.
