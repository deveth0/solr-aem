{{wiktionary|prelate}}
A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;prelate&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a high-ranking member of the [[clergy]] who is an [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] or who ranks in precedence with ordinaries. The word derives from the [[Latin]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;prælatus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the past participle of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;præferre&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which means &amp;quot;carry before&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;be set above or over&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;prefer&amp;quot;; hence, a prelate is one set over others.

The archetypal prelate is a [[bishop]], whose prelature is his [[particular church]]. All other prelates, including the [[religious institute|regular]] prelates such as [[abbot]]s and major superiors, are based upon this original model of prelacy.

==Related terminology==

A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;prelature&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the office of a prelate or the entire juridical entity which the prelate governs. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Prelacy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the body of prelates as a whole or a system of government, administration or ministry by prelates.

Sometimes the [[clergy]] of a [[state church]] with a formal [[hierarchy]] are called prelates without having ordinary [[jurisdiction]].

Higher-ranking [[monsignor]]s are given the title of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;honorary Prelate of H. H.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; In some countries such as Germany; they are addressed as Mr. Prelate while regular prelates are addressed with their other titles and respective courteous forms, such as Mr. Bishop, Your Lordship etc.

==Territorial prelatures==
{{main|Territorial prelature}}

A [[territorial prelature]] is, in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] usage, a prelate whose geographic jurisdiction, called territorial prelature, does not belong to any diocese. A territorial prelate is sometimes called a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;prelate nullius,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from the Latin &amp;apos;&amp;apos;nullius diœceseos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, prelate &amp;quot;of no diocese&amp;quot;, meaning the territory falls directly under the [[Holy See|jurisdiction of the pope]] and is not a diocese under a residing bishop.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Prelate}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; {{As of|2006}}, there were 49 territorial prelatures, all in the [[Latin Catholic Church|Latin Church]].

The term also is used in a generic sense, in which case it may equally refer to an apostolic prefecture, an apostolic vicariate or a territorial abbacy.

==Personal prelatures==
{{main|Personal prelature}}

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;personal prelature&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was conceived during the sessions of the [[Second Vatican Council]] in no. 10 of the decree &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Presbyterorum ordinis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and was later enacted into law by [[Paul VI]] in his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[motu proprio]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ecclesiae sanctae&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The institution was later reaffirmed in the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|1983 Code of Canon Law]].&amp;lt;ref = &amp;quot;Vatican&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://va./archive/ENG1104/__P10.HTM Personal Prelatures cann. 294–297]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Such a prelature is an institution having clergy and (possibly) lay members which would carry out specific pastoral activities.  The adjective &amp;apos;&amp;apos;personal&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refers to the fact that, in contrast with previous [[Canon law|canonical]] use for ecclesiastical institutions, the [[jurisdiction]] of the prelate is not linked to a territory but over persons wherever they be. The establishment of personal prelatures is an exercise of the [[theology|theologically]] inherent power of self-organization which the Church has to pursue its mission, though a personal prelature is not a [[particular church]] as [[diocese]]s and [[military ordinariate]]s are.

Personal prelatures are fundamentally secular organizations operating &amp;apos;&amp;apos;in&amp;apos;&amp;apos; the world (members take no vows and live normal, everyday lives), whereas religious institutes are religious organizations operating &amp;apos;&amp;apos;out&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the world (members take vows and lead lives in accordance with their specific organization).

The first (and {{As of|2012|lc=on}}, only) personal prelature is [[Opus Dei]], which was elevated to a personal prelature by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1982 through the [[Apostolic constitution]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ut sit&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In the case of Opus Dei, the prelate is elected by members of the prelature and confirmed by the Pope, the laity and clergy of the prelature are still under the governance of the particular church where they live, and the laity associated with the prelature (both men and women) are organically united under the jurisdiction of the prelate.
