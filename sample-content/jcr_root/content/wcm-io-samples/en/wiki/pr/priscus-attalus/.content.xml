&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Priscus Attalus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (d. after 416) was twice [[Roman usurper]] (in 409 and in 414), against [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], with [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] support.

Priscus Attalus was a Greek from Asia whose father had moved to Italy under Valentinian I. Attalus was an important [[Roman Senate|senator]] in [[Roman Empire|Rome]], who served as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[praefectus urbi]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 409. He was twice proclaimed emperor by the [[Visigoths]], in an effort to impose their terms on the ineffectual Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], in [[Ravenna]].

He held the title of Emperor in Rome, during 409, and later in [[Bordeaux]] in 414. His two reigns lasted only a few months; the first one ended when [[Alaric I|Alaric]] believed it was hampering his negotiations with Honorius, and the second came to an end after he was abandoned by the Visigoths and eventually captured by Honorius&amp;apos; men. Attalus was obliged to participate in the [[Roman Triumph|triumph]] Honorius celebrated in the streets of Rome in 416, before finishing his days exiled in the [[Lipari Islands]].
