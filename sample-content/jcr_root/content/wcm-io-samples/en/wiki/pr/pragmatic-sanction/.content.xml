A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;pragmatic sanction&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a sovereign&amp;apos;s solemn decree on a matter of primary importance and has the force of fundamental law. In the late history of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] it referred more specifically to an edict issued by the Emperor.

When used as a proper noun, and the year is not mentioned, it usually refers to the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], a legal mechanism designed to ensure that the Austrian throne and Habsburg lands would be inherited by [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI&amp;apos;s]] daughter, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]].

Pragmatic sanctions tend to be issued at times in which the theoretically ideal situation is untenable, and a change of the rules is called for.
*The Pragmatic Sanction of [[Justinian I]], promulgated in August 554, on the reorganization of [[Italy]] following the [[Gothic War (535â€“554)|Gothic War]].
*The so-called Pragmatic Sanction of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], purporting to have been issued in March 1269, regarding various clerical reforms, was a forgery fabricated in the 15th century.
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges]], issued on July 7, 1438 by King [[Charles VII of France]], limited the authority of the pope over the Church within France.
*The German [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1439]], issued by German ruling princes March 26, 1439, accepted some of the decrees of the [[Council of Basel]] with modifications. It has been argued that the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pragmatic Sanction&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is not properly applied to this document, as it was issued by princes subordinate to the emperor without the emperor&amp;apos;s endorsement.
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]], issued by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], established the [[Seventeen Provinces]] as an entity separate from the Empire and from France.
*The Croatian Pragmatic Sanction was a law of Diet of Kingdom of Croatia allowing female inheritance of Throne of Croatia if Charles VI had no male heirs.
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] issued by Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] on April 19, 1713.
*The Pragmatic Sanction voted by the Hungarian Parliament in 1723 in which the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] accepted female [[inheritance]], allowing Austrian empress [[Maria Theresa]] to become queen of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/southernslavques00seto/southernslavques00seto_djvu.txt R. W. SETON -WATSON: The southern Slav question and the Habsburg Monarchy page 22]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
*The [[Pragmatic Sanction of Naples]], issued October 6, 1759, by King [[Charles III of Spain]], governed the succession to the thrones of Naples, Sicily, and Spain, and forbade the union of Spain and the Two Sicilies.
*The Spanish [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830]], issued March 29, 1830 by King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], ratified a Decree of 1789 by [[Charles IV of Spain]], which had replaced the semi-[[Salic law|Salic]] system established by Philip V with the mixed succession system that had characterized historically the Castilian monarchy (upon which the Spanish monarchy draws its traditions), as noted by the inheritance by queens regnant [[Urraca of Castile]], [[Isabella I of Castile]], and [[Joanna I of Castile]].
