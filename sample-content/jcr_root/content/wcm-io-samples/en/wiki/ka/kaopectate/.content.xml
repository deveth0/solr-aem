&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kaopectate&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, known medically as [[bismuth subsalicylate]] in the United States and attapulgite in Canada, is an orally taken [[medication]] from Chattem, Inc. for the treatment of mild [[diarrhea]]. It is also sometimes used to treat indigestion, nausea and stomach ulcers. In the U.S., kaopectate is now equivalent to a tableted form of [[Pepto-Bismol]], and is no longer made from [[kaolinite]] and [[pectin]].

Children should not take medication with bismuth subsalicylate while recovering from [[influenza]] or [[chicken pox]], as epidemiologic evidence points to an association between the use of [[salicylate]]-containing medications during certain viral infections and the onset of [[Reye&amp;apos;s syndrome]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.reyessyndrome.org/aspirin.htm Aspirin or Salicylate-Containing Medications], reyessyndrome.org&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; For the same reason, it is typically recommended that nursing mothers not use medication containing bismuth subsalicylate because small amounts of the medication are excreted in breast milk and pose a theoretical risk of Reye&amp;apos;s syndrome to nursing children.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/disease/illness.htm CDC warning about breastfeeding while taking medications]{{Dead link|date=August 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Ingredients==
The active ingredient in Kaopectate has changed since its original creation. Originally, [[kaolinite]] was used as the [[adsorbent]] and [[pectin]] as the [[emollient]]. [[Attapulgite]] (a type of absorbent [[clay]]) replaced the kaolinite in the 1980s, but since 2004, [[bismuth subsalicylate]] has been used as the active ingredient in U.S. marketed products.&amp;lt;ref name=avma&amp;gt;[http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/nov03/031115b.asp Kaopectate Reformulation Could be Dangerous to Cats.] Article in JAVMA (Journal of American Veterinary Medical Association, Nov. 15, 2003&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  In Canada, McNeil Consumer Healthcare continues to market Kaopectate using [[attapulgite]] as the active ingredient.

==Use on animals==

The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) does not have a clear stance on the administration of Kaopectate products on animals such as dogs and cats that are suffering from diarrhea. However, the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association Journal news article noted in 2003 that the new subsalicylate formulation might be harmful to cats, which do not tolerate salicylates well. &amp;lt;ref name=avma /&amp;gt;

Kaolin-pectate, the original compound, was approved by the [http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/04n0480/04N-0480-EC4-Attach-1.pdf OTA (Organic Trade Association)] for use in animals being produced for food.
