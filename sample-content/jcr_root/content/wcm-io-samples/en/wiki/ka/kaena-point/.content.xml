&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ka{{okina}}ena&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kaena Point&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the westernmost tip of land on the island of [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]].  The point can be reached on foot from both the East (via O{{okina}}ahu&amp;apos;s North Shore / [[Mokuleia, Hawaii|Mokulē{{okina}}ia]]) and  Southeast (via Wai{{okina}}anae Coast). An unimproved track extends some {{convert|3|mi|km}} along the coast from the end of the paved road on the east side, where a gate prevents entry of all except authorized vehicles.On the southeast side, at &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ka{{okina}}ena State Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a paved road passes a beach before terminating into an unpaved road. It continues for a few miles, after which the road is washed out, and further travel must be on foot. It is not possible to travel around the point in a vehicle as the route is better described as a &amp;quot;path&amp;quot; in most places, and is lined on one side with a cliff and on the other with [[basalt]] rocks which are quite capable of damaging vehicles.

In [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ka{{okina}}ena&amp;apos;&amp;apos; means &amp;apos;the heat&amp;apos;.  The area was named after a brother or cousin of [[Pele (Goddess)|Pele]] who accompanied her from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kahiki&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The [[Hawaii|State of Hawai{{okina}}i]] has designated the point as a Natural Area Reserve to protect nesting Laysan Albatrosses and wedge-tailed Shearwaters, Hawaiian monk seals, and the fragile (to vehicular traffic) native strand vegetation that has been restored there.

Some ancient Hawaiian folklore states that Ka{{okina}}ena Point is the &amp;quot;jumping-off&amp;quot; point for souls leaving this world.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web

During the winter months, O{{okina}}ahu&amp;apos;s North Shore is typically bombarded by large, powerful waves that attract [[Surfing|surfers]] from around the world. It is rumored that Ka{{okina}}ena Point typically has waves (up to {{convert|15|m|ft|disp=or}} in height) larger than those at Waimea Bay, one of O{{okina}}ahu&amp;apos;s world-famous surfing locations. This has not been confirmed; however, during the famous &amp;quot;Swell Of The Century&amp;quot; in 1969 and on the day of [[Greg Noll]]&amp;apos;s famous wave at Mākaha, Greg himself took a picture of a gigantic wave breaking at Ka{{okina}}ena Point. Until &amp;quot;Biggest Wednesday&amp;quot; on 28 January 1998, when professional surfer [[Ken Bradshaw]] was photographed riding a wave with a reported {{convert|85|ft|m|adj=on}} face, it was believed that Noll&amp;apos;s picture showed the largest wave ever photographed. During that famous swell in January 1998, several persons reported seeing waves with {{convert|60|-|80|ft|m|adj=on}} faces at Ka{{okina}}ena Point.

Despite these reports, Ka{{okina}}ena Point does not have the popularity with surfers of other North Shore locations. Ka{{okina}}ena Point is located in a very remote area with no direct paved road access and no rescue capabilities. Additionally, the Point&amp;apos;s geography results in [[undertow (wave action)|undertows]], dangerous [[rip current]]s and other hazardous ocean conditions that make any water activity highly dangerous.
