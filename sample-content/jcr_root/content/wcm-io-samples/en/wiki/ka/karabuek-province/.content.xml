&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Karabük Province&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-tr|Karabük ili }}) is a landlocked [[Provinces of Turkey|province]] in the northern part of [[Anatolia]] (northern central [[Turkey]]), located about {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Ankara]], {{convert|115|km|0|abbr=on}} away from [[Zonguldak]] and {{convert|113|km|0|abbr=on}} away from [[Kastamonu]], with a total population of 227,610 (as of 2010). The main city is [[Karabük]] which is located about {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the [[Black Sea]] coast.

Karabük Province is one of the newest provinces of Turkey. Until 1995 it was a district of [[Zonguldak Province|Zonguldak]], when it became an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Provinces of Turkey|il]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (provincial center) in its own right. Established in 1995, it comprises Karabük, Eflani, Safranbolu and Yenice districts which were formerly part of [[Zonguldak Province]] and Eskipazar and Ovacık districts which were previously part of [[Çankırı Province]].

Karabük is located on the highway between [[Bartın Province|Bartın]] and [[Ankara]], which was in ancient times an important route between [[Amasra]] on the coast and central [[Anatolia]]. The railway between Ankara and [[Zonguldak]] passes through Karabük.
