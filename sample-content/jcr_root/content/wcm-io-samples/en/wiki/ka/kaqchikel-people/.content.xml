The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kaqchikel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are one of the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Maya peoples]] of the midwestern highlands in [[Guatemala]].  The name was formerly spelled in various other ways, including Cakchiquel, Cakchiquel, Kakchiquel, Caqchikel, and Cachiquel.

In [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic Maya]] times the capital of the main branch of the Kaqchikel was [[Iximché]]. Like the neighboring [[K&amp;apos;iche&amp;apos; people|K&amp;apos;iche&amp;apos; (Quiché)]], they were governed by four lords: Tzotzil, Xahil, Tucuché and [[Chajoma|Acajal]], who were responsible for the administrative, military and religious affairs. The Kakchikel recorded their history in the book [[Annals of the Cakchiquels]], also known as [[Memorial de Sololá]].

The [[Chajoma]] were another [[Kaqchikel language|Kaqchikel]]-speaking people; the ruins of [[Mixco Viejo]] have been identified as their capital.

Iximché was conquered by the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Pedro de Alvarado]] in 1524. At that time, the Kaqchikel were the enemies of the neighbouring [[K&amp;apos;iche&amp;apos; Kingdom of Q&amp;apos;umarkaj|K&amp;apos;iche&amp;apos; Kingdom]], and helped the Spaniards to conquer it. The first colonial capital of [[Guatemala]], [[Tecpán Guatemala]], was founded near Iximché on July 25, 1524. On November 22, 1527, after several Kaqchikel uprisings, the capital was moved to [[Ciudad Vieja]], near [[Antigua Guatemala]].

The [[Kaqchikel language]], one of the [[Mayan languages]], is spoken today by 400,000 people. They subsist agriculturally, and their culture reflects a fusion of Maya and [[Culture of Spain|Spanish influences]].
