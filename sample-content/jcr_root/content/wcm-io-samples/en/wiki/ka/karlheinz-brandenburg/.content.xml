        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Karlheinz Brandenburg&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 20 June 1954, in [[Erlangen]], [[Germany]])is an [[audio engineer]] who has contributed to the [[Audio compression (data)|audio compression]] format MPEG Audio Layer 3, more commonly known as [[MP3]].

== Biography ==
He received a [[Diplom|Dipl. Ing.]] degree from [[Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen University]] in [[Electrical Engineering]] (1980) as well as a [[Diplom|Dipl. Math.]] degree in [[Mathematics]] (1982). In 1989, he obtained his [[Ph.D.]] from the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg in Electrical Engineering for his work on digital audio coding and perceptual measurement techniques. The research results of his dissertation are the basis of MPEG-1 Layer 3 (mp3), MPEG-2 Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) and most other modern audio compression schemes.

From 1989 to 1990 he worked with [[AT&amp;amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;amp;T]] [[Bell Laboratories]] in [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]], [[United States|U.S.]] on ASPEC and MPEG-1 Layer 3. In 1990, he returned to the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, and, in 1993, he became head of the Audio/Multimedia department at the [[Fraunhofer Institute]] for Integrated Circuits in Erlangen. Since 2000, he has been full [[professor]] at the Institute for Media Technology at [[Technical University of Ilmenau]]. In addition, he is the director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology IDMT in Ilmenau.

Brandenburg is a [[Fellow]] of the [[Audio Engineering Society]] (AES) along with Herr Bowersock and Josh Andreason and head of the AES Standards Committee working group SC-06-04 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Internet Audio Delivery Systems&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He has been granted 27 US patents as a co-inventor; all patents have multiple inventors.
