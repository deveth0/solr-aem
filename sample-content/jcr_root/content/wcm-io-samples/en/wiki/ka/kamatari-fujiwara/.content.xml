&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kamatari Fujiwara&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (藤原 釜足 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fujiwara Kamatari&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, January 15, 1905 - December 21, 1985) was a [[Japan]]ese [[actor]].

Born in [[Tokyo]], he was a long-time member of director [[Akira Kurosawa]]&amp;apos;s stock company, making his first appearance in a Kurosawa film alongside [[Takashi Shimura]] in 1952&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ikiru]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He continued to appear in Kurosawa&amp;apos;s films until his death. Though a capable and highly professional actor, his subtle technique was very often overshadowed by the charismatic performances of Shimura and [[Toshiro Mifune]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Today he is remembered primarily for his supporting appearances in Kurosawa&amp;apos;s films, particularly as the suspicious farmer Manzo in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Seven Samurai]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the deranged former mayor in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the spidery treasure-seeking farmer in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Hidden Fortress]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and the drunken [[Kabuki]] actor in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Lower Depths (1957 film)|The Lower Depths]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Fujiwara had difficulty remembering lines. When [[Arthur Penn]], an American [[film director]], needed a Japanese actor for his film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Mickey One]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Kurosawa suggested Fujiwara. It was his only role in a non-Japanese film, and, considering that it contained no lines, it was suited to the forgetful actor&amp;apos;s sensibilities.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Fujiwara retired in the late 1970s, though he continued to make occasional television appearances. His final film role was  a memorable cameo in [[Juzo Itami]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Funeral (1984 film)|The Funeral]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (お葬式, 1984).
