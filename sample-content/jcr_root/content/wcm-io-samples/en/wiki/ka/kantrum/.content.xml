&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kantrum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Thai language|Thai]] กันตรึม) is a type of [[folk music]] played by the [[Khmer Surin|Khmer]] in [[Isan]], [[Thailand]], living near the border with [[Cambodia]].  It is a fast, traditional [[dance music]].  In its purest form, [[cho-kantrum]], [[singer]]s, [[percussion instrument|percussion]] and [[fiddle]]s dominate the sound.  A more modern form using electric instrumentation arose in the mid-1980s.

==Language==
Kantrum is interesting from a linguistic perspective.  As the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] native to [[Thailand]] are bilingual, Kantrum songs can be sung in [[Thai language|Thai]] ([[Isan language|Isan dialect]]), [[Northern Khmer dialect|Northern Khmer]] or a combination of the two. In the case of the later, it is most common that a complete verse will be sung in Thai followed by a reciprocating verse in [[Khmer language|Khmer]]. However, [[Code-switching|code switching]] between the two languages within the same verse also occurs, lending to a wide variety of possibilities for rhyming and tonal euphony.

==Performers==
In the late-1980s, [[Darkie (musician)|Darkie]] became the genre&amp;apos;s biggest star, crossing into mainstream markets in the later 1990s. Another artist known for Kantrum is [[Chalermpol Malakham]] although he is also a popular performer of [[Luk Thung]] and [[Morlam]].
