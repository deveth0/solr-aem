&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Karol Borsuk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (May 8, 1905 – January 24, 1982) was a [[Poland|Polish]] mathematician.
His main interest was [[topology]].

Borsuk introduced the theory of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;absolute retracts&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ARs) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;absolute neighborhood retracts&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ANRs), and the [[cohomotopy group]]s, later called Borsuk–[[Edwin Spanier|Spanier]] cohomotopy groups. He also founded the so called [[Shape theory (mathematics)|Shape theory]]. He has constructed various beautiful examples of topological spaces, e.g. an acyclic, 3-dimensional continuum which admits a fixed point free homeomorphism onto itself; also 2-dimensional, contractible polyhedra which have no free edge. His topological and geometric conjectures and themes stimulated research for more than half a century.

Borsuk received his [[master&amp;apos;s degree]] and [[doctorate]] from [[Warsaw University]] in 1927 and 1930, respectively; his [[Ph.D.]] thesis advisor was [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz]]. He was a member of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] from 1952.  Borsuk&amp;apos;s students included [[Samuel Eilenberg]], [[Krystyna Kuperberg]], [[Włodzimierz Kuperberg]], and [[Jerzy Dydak]].
