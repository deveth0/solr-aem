&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kathryn Jean Martin &amp;quot;Kathy&amp;quot; Sullivan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Order of Australia|AM]] (born 8 March 1942), [[Australia]]n politician, was a [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] member of the [[Australian Senate]] from 1974 to 1984, representing [[Queensland]], and a member of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] for the [[Division of Moncrieff]], Queensland, from 1984 to 2001.&amp;lt;ref name=parlbio&amp;gt;[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;page=0;query=Kathy%20Sullivan;rec=0;resCount=Default Parliamentary profile]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; She served longer in the Australian Parliament than any other woman, oustripping the record previously held by [[Dorothy Tangney]].   She was the first woman member of the parliament to have served in both houses.&amp;lt;ref name=mccann&amp;gt;Dr Joy McCann and Janet Wilson (7 March 2012): [http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/2011-2012/Womeninparliament Representation of women in Australian parliaments], Australian Parliamentary Library.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Sullivan was born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kathryn Jean Martin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Brisbane]], Queensland, and was educated at the [[University of Queensland]], where she graduated in arts. She was a teacher, administrative officer and part-time lecturer before entering politics.&amp;lt;ref name=parlbio /&amp;gt;

She was elected to the Senate at the [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974 election]], and sat as Senator Kathy Martin.  She resigned from the Senate in 1984 in order to contest the newly created lower house seat of [[Division of Moncrieff|Moncrieff]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1984|1984 election]].  Soon after entering the House of Representatives she changed her name to Kathy Sullivan.

Sullivan was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry (1983–84) and (1993–94). She was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (1997–2000).&amp;lt;ref name=parlbio /&amp;gt;

She has been a vocal advocate for an increase in the number of women in parliament.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?/news/politics/2002/08/item20020805102623_1.htm Senate vacancy]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 2003, she was made a Member of the [[Order of Australia]], for service to the Parliament of Australia and to the community, particularly as an advocate for improved services and conditions affecting women.&amp;lt;ref name=am&amp;gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1042259&amp;amp;search_type=quick&amp;amp;showInd=true SULLIVAN, Kathy], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;It&amp;apos;s an Honour&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 2003.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Sullivan was a relatively low-profile MP but in 1993 received national attention when ALP Treasurer John Dawkins taunted her by calling her &amp;quot;sweetheart&amp;quot; in Parliament, which outraged female MPs from Dawkins&amp;apos; own party.
