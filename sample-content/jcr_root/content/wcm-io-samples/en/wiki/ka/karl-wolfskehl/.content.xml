        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Karl Wolfskehl&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (17 September 1869 &amp;amp;ndash; 30 June 1948) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Jew]]ish author who wrote [[poetry]], [[prose]] and [[drama]] in [[German language|German]]. He also translated from French, English, Italian, Hebrew, Latin and [[Middle High German]] into German.

He was born in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]], the son of the banker and lawyer Otto Wolfskehl. He studied in [[Leipzig]] and [[Berlin]]. In 1898 he married Hanna de Haan, daughter of the Dutch  Director of the Darmstadt Chamber Orchestra. They had two daughters: Judith (born 1899) and Renate (born 1901).

He was active in the [[Munich Cosmic Circle]], a group of intellectuals in Munich based around [[Alfred Schuler]]. This group broke up in 1904 due to a rift between Wolfskehl, supported by [[Stefan George]], and [[Ludwig Klages]], supported by Schuler.

He emigrated to [[Switzerland]] in (1933), then to [[Italy]] (1934) and ultimately, with his partner Margot Ruben (1908–1980), to [[New Zealand]] (1938). He died there in 1948.
