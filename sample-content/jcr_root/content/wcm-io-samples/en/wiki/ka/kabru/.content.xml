&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kabru&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  is a [[mountain]] in the [[Himalayas]] on the border of [[India]] and eastern [[Nepal]]. It is part of a ridge that extends south from [[Kangchenjunga]] and is the southernmost {{convert|7000|m|ft|-2}} peak in the world.

The main features of this ridge are as follows (north to south):

* Kangchenjunga south top, 8476 m, at {{Coord|27|41|30|N|88|09|15|E}}
* A 6600–6700 m saddle, located at {{Coord|27|39|51|N|88|09|39|E}}
* A 7349 m summit, known as Talung, at {{Coord|27|39|18|N|88|07|51|E}}
* A 6983 m saddle, at {{Coord|27|38|51|N|88|07|21|E}}
* A 7412 m summit, at {{Coord|27|38|06|N|88|07|06|E}}. This point has sufficient [[topographic prominence|prominence]] to be classified as the highest point of a separate mountain, according to the definition used in [[List of highest mountains]]. It is confusingly referred to by some authorities as &amp;quot;Kabru IV&amp;quot;, but it is not clear that this is correct, or that any &amp;quot;Kabru&amp;quot; name is correctly applied to this summit. According to the 1996 version of the Himalayan Journal (pp.&amp;amp;nbsp;29–36), members of an Indian Army expedition reached this summit in May 1994.
* A substantial &amp;quot;field of firn&amp;quot; measuring about 2&amp;amp;nbsp;km from north to south, and 1&amp;amp;nbsp;km from east to west. This is almost entirely over 7200 m, and the watershed divide that runs through this field does not drop below this height.
* A 7338 m summit, at ca. {{Coord|27|37|09|N|88|07|28|E}}, at the eastern boundary of the field of firn. This point, which is known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kabru North&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was reached by [[CRCooke|C.R.Cooke]] on 18 November 1935, without oxygen. It remained the highest solo climb until 1953. Although it is lower than the 7412 m summit, which Cooke did not ascend, it was considered at the time, and may still be considered, to be Kabru&amp;apos;s highest point; the higher summit was considered to be an unnamed summit along the ridge to Kangchenjunga.
* An intervening c.7200 m saddle. Cooke&amp;apos;s account implies that there are two intervening tops between this saddle and Kabru North.
* A 7318 m summit, at {{Coord|27|36|30|N|88|06|42|E}}, known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kabru South&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the southernmost &amp;quot;7000 m peak&amp;quot; in the world. This was climbed by an Indian party in 1994.

To the south west of Kabru south, there is a 6400 m saddle and a 6682 m summit known as Rathong. To its south east is the 6600 m Kabru Dome.

In 2004, a group of [[Serbia]]n climbers unsuccessfully attempted the mountain. A series of avalanches forced the group to give up their goal.
