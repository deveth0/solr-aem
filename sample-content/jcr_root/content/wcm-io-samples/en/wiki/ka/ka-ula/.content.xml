&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ka{{okina}}ula&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Island, also called Ka{{okina}}ula Rock, is a small, crescent-shaped offshore islet in the [[Hawaiian Islands]].

==Geography==
It is located {{convert|23|mi|km}} west-southwest of Kawaihoa Point on [[Niihau|Ni{{okina}}ihau]], and about {{convert|150|nmi|km}} west of [[Honolulu]]. The island is actually the very top of a volcanic [[tuff cone]] that rests on top of a larger, submerged [[shield volcano]]. At its highest point, the island reaches a height of {{convert|548|ft|m}}.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.volcanolive.com/kaula.html Kaula Volcano] John Seach, Volcano Live&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The ocean has carved large sea cliffs on the sides of the island. There is a large cave on the northwest side of the island called [[Kahalauaola]] (Shark Cave).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://atsea.nmfs.hawaii.edu/islands/kaula.htm Ka{{okina}}ula Island]  NOAA Ship Townsend Cromwell, Student Connection&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The [[United States Census Bureau]] defines Ka{{okina}}ula as [[census tract|Census Tract]] 411 of [[Kauai County, Hawaii|Kaua{{okina}}i County, Hawai{{okina}}i]]. The [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]] showed that the uninhabited island had a land area of {{convert|158.2|acre|km2 sqmi}}.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;amp;-show_geoid=Y&amp;amp;-tree_id=4001&amp;amp;-_showChild=Y&amp;amp;-context=dt&amp;amp;-errMsg=&amp;amp;-all_geo_types=N&amp;amp;-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_P001&amp;amp;-redoLog=false&amp;amp;-transpose=N&amp;amp;-search_map_config=|b=50|l=en|t=4001|zf=0.0|ms=sel_00dec|dw=0.32574415146711605|dh=0.22784596312794334|dt=gov.census.aff.domain.map.EnglishMapExtent|if=gif|cx=-160.54887078557877|cy=21.657999272138042|zl=5|pz=5|bo=318:317:316:314:313:323:319|bl=362:393:358:357:356:355:354|ft=350:349:335:389:388:332:331|fl=381:403:204:380:369:379:368|g=01000US&amp;amp;-PANEL_ID=p_dt_geo_map&amp;amp;-_lang=en&amp;amp;-geo_id=14000US15007041100&amp;amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;amp;-format=&amp;amp;-search_results=01000US&amp;amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U Census Tract 411, Kaua{{okina}}i County] United States Census Bureau&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Because of [[erosion]], the island is slowly shrinking.

Kaʻula, which he spelled as &amp;quot;Tahoora&amp;quot;, was one of the first five islands sighted by Captain James Cook in 1778.

==Lighthouse==
A [[lighthouse]] was completed on the island in 1932 by the former [[United States Lighthouse Service]]. It remained in operation through 1947.

==Military use==
The island has been used as a [[bombing range]] by the [[United States Navy]] since at least 1952. Inert ordnance is currently used, although live explosive ordnance has been used in the past. There is a risk of [[unexploded ordnance]] on the island. Permission from the U.S. Navy is required to land on the island.  In 1978, over the objection of the U.S. Navy, the state of Hawai{{okina}}i claimed ownership of Ka{{okina}}ula and named the island a State Seabird Sanctuary. A final determination of ownership has not yet been made, and the Navy still uses the southeast point of the island as an aerial bombing and strafing
target.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/nsd/coastpilot/files/cp7/CP7-42ed-Ch14_7.pdf U.S. Coast Pilot 7, Chapter 14, p. 634]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Diving==
Ka{{okina}}ula is uninhabited but fishermen and [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]] frequently visit the island. Five Fathom Pinnacle, {{convert|3|mi|km}} west-northwest of Ka{{okina}}ula, is also a noted dive spot.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.xpda.com/nwhi/5fathomPinnacle Underwater Photos from Five Fathom Pinnacle]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
