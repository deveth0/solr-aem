&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kathryn Hulme&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (July 6, 1900 - August 25, 1981) was an American author and memoirist most noted for her novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Nun&amp;apos;s Story]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The book is often, mistakenly, understood to be semi-biographical.

==Writing==
Her [[1956 in literature|1956]] book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Nun&amp;apos;s Story&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a best-selling novel which was made into an [[Academy awards|award-winning]] 1959 movie starring [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Peter Finch]].

Another work, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Undiscovered Country: A Spiritual Adventure&amp;apos;&amp;apos; published by Little, Brown &amp;amp; Co. was a description of her years as a student of mystic [[G. I. Gurdjieff]]. Hulme studied with Gurdjieff as part of a group of women known as &amp;quot;The Rope&amp;quot;, which included eight members in all: [[Jane Heap]], [[Help:Disambiguation|Elizabeth Gordon]], [[Solita Solano]], [[Margaret Caroline Anderson]], [[Louise Davidson]] and [[Alice Rohrer]], besides them.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.gurdjieff-legacy.org/70links/rope.htm The Rope] gurdjieff-legacy.org.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

She is also the author of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wild Place&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a description of her experiences as the UNRRA Director of the Polish Displaced Persons (DP) camp at Wildflecken, Germany, after WWII.  This work won the Atlantic Non-Fiction Award in 1952.

It was at Wildflecken that Hulme met a Belgian nurse and former nun named [[Marie Louise Habets]], who became her lifelong companion. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Nun&amp;apos;s Story&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a slightly fictionalized biographical account of Habets&amp;apos; life as a nun.

No one questions that adults and children see the world differently. The former strive for understanding; the latter are captured by wonderâ€”even in the aftermath of a natural disaster. In her 1938 fictionalized autobiography &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;amp;BBID=10182336&amp;amp;v3=1 &amp;quot;We Lived as Children,&amp;quot;]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; San Francisco native Kathryn Hulme captured this difference, as her persona tells of watching San Francisco burn after the tragic 1906 earthquake.
