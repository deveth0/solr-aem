&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kate Richardson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born June 27, 1984 in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] artistic [[gymnastics|gymnast]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gymbox.net/Richardson.htm|title=GymBox}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; She began gymnastics at age three. At the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], she placed 7th in the [[floor exercise]] event and 15th all-around.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ri/kate-richardson-1.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; She graduated [[UCLA]] in 2007 with a degree in psychobiology.

Member of Canada&amp;apos;s Women&amp;apos;s Artistic Gymnastics Team, 1996-2004. National Novice Champion, 1996; Junior Champion, 1998; and Canadian Champion, 2001.

==International honours==

Richardson placed 19th all-around at the [[1999 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships]] in [[Tianjin]], [[China]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;www.gymcan.org/site/files/about/canadian_results_1956-2006.pdf&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; She placed 16th all-around at the [[2001 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships]] in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;www.gymcan.org/site/files/about/canadian_results_1956-2006.pdf.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

At the 2002 [[Commonwealth Games]] in Manchester, England, Richardson became [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] All-Around Champion, also winning gold on [[balance beam (gymnastics)|Balance Beam]]. She competed for Canada at two Summer Olympic Games - [[Sydney]] 2000, where she placed 15th all-around,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;www.gymcan.org/site/files/about/canadian_results_1956-2006.pdf&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and [[Athens]] 2004, where she qualified for the [[floor (gymnastics)|Floor Exercise]] final, placing 7th.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.gymn.ca/athletes/women/richardson.shtml&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  She was the first Canadian woman to qualify for an Olympic final.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;www.gymcan.org/site/.../gymnastics_excellence_en_gymnastique_2009.pdf.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Even more remarkable was the fact that she qualified for the Olympics while competing in the [[NCAA]], a feat not achieved in women&amp;apos;s gymnastics since [[Kelly Garrison Steves]] in 1988. Fellow Bruin [[Mohini Bhardwaj]] also competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics, after her NCAA career was completed.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/athens2004/usa/Mohini+Bhardwaj/1726086&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==College gymnastics career==
In 2002, Richardson was granted an athletic [[scholarship]] to attend UCLA, where she joined the [[UCLA Bruins]] gymnastics team, repeating NCAA Champions in 2003 and 2004. Her teammates have included fellow individual NCAA champions [[Kristen Maloney]], [[Tasha Schwikert]] and [[Jamie Dantzscher]]. During her four years competing for the Bruins, she also won Individual NCAA Championship titles on Balance Beam (2003), Bars (2003) and Floor Exercise (2006). In 2006, she was named Pac-10 Female Student-Athlete of the Year.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uclabruins.com/sports/w-gym/mtt/richardson_kate00.html|title=UCLA Gymnastics website}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

She has now retired from competitive gymnastics and is pursuing a Masters degree in Physical Therapy at the University of British Columbia.  She has mastered the craft of sign-making.
