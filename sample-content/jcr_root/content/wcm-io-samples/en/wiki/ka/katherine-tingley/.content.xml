&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Katherine Augusta Westcott Tingley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  (born July 6, 1847, [[Newbury, Massachusetts|Newbury]], [[Massachusetts]]; died July 11, 1929, [[VisingsÃ¶]], [[Sweden]]) was a [[social worker]] and prominent [[Theosophy|Theosophist]]. She was the leader, after W. Q. Judge, of the [[Theosophical Society Pasadena|American Section of the Theosophical Society]]. She founded and led the Theosophical community [[Lomaland]] in [[Point Loma]], [[California]].

Tingley grew up in [[Newbury, Massachusetts]]. She married Philo B. Tingley in 1888. She was working as a [[social worker]] in [[New York]] when she met [[William Quan Judge]]. She joined the [[Theosophical Society]] on October 13, 1894.

In 1895, disputes between Judge and [[Annie Besant]] led to a split, with Judge taking most of the American section with him, and leading it for one year until his death in 1896. At that point Tingley became the new head of [[Theosophical Society Pasadena|the organization]], although her identity was concealed for one year. In 1898, a group of roughly 200 theosophists led by Ernest Temple Hargrove seceded from Tingley&amp;apos;s organization, and formed a [[Theosophical Society in America (Hargrove)|rival group]] based in [[New York City]].

On February 13, 1900, she transferred the Society&amp;apos;s international headquarters from [[New York City]] to a new colony she called [[Lomaland]], located in the [[Point Loma, San Diego|Point Loma]] community near [[San Diego]], [[California]]. Her settlement included Raja-Yoga School and College, Theosophical University, and the School for the Revival of the Lost Mysteries of Antiquity.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sandiegohistory.org/search/google/Katherine%20Tingley?query=Katherine%20Tingley&amp;amp;cx=016789698446270368612%3Ai66buwrua4i&amp;amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;amp;sitesearch=&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off San Diego Historical Society: Katherine Tingley biography]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

After her death, her successors transferred the society, first to [[Covina, California]] and then later to [[Pasadena, California]] where it currently exists.
