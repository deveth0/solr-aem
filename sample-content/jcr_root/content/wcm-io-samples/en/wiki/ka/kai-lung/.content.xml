==Character introduction==
Kai Lung is a Chinese storyteller whose travels and exploits serve mainly as excuses to introduce substories, which generally take up the majority of a Kai Lung book.

==Character sketch==
===Motivations===
Kai Lung is a man of very simple motivations; most frequently, he is animated by a desire for enough [[tael]]s to be able to feed and clothe himself. Otherwise, his main motivation is love for his wife, Hwa-mei, and he seeks nothing more than a simple, sustainable lifestyle. Generally, he does not intrude in other people&amp;apos;s affairs unless he thinks it necessary to teach them the rudiments of classical proportion with one of his fables.

===Conflicts===
This character usually comes into conflict with barbarians, bandits, and other people who are not classically educated, as well as various unscrupulous individuals who are intent on taking away his property.
