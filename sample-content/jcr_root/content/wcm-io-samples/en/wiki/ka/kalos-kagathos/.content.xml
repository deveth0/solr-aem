        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kalos kagathos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|καλὸς κἀγαθός}} {{IPA-el|kalos kaːɡatʰǒs|}}),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;kalokagathos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; derived from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;kalos kai agathos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; of which [[wiktionary:kalokagathia|kalokagathia]] ({{lang|grc|καλοκαγαθία}}) is the derived noun, is a phrase used by [[Ancient Greece|classical Greek]] writers to describe an ideal of personal conduct, especially in a military context.   Its use is attested since [[Herodotus]] and the classical period.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{LSJ|kaloka)/gaqos|κα^λοκἄγα^θ-ος|ref}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The phrase is adjectival, composed of two adjectives, {{lang|grc|καλός}} (&amp;quot;beautiful&amp;quot;) and {{lang|grc|ἀγαθός}} (&amp;quot;good&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;virtuous&amp;quot;), the second of which is combined by [[crasis]] with καί &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; to form {{lang|grc|κἀγαθός}}.    [[Werner Jaeger]] summarizes it as  ”the [[Chivalry|chivalrous]] ideal of the complete human personality, harmonious in mind and body, foursquare in battle and speech, song and action”.  &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Paideia, The Ideals of Greek Culture&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Werner Jaeger, trans. By Gilbert Highet, Oxford University Press, NY, 1945, p. 13.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Uses ==
The phrase could be used both in a generic sense, or with certain specific force. As a generic term, it may have been used as the combination of distinct virtues, which we might translate as &amp;quot;handsome and brave&amp;quot;, or the intersection of the two words &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;upstanding&amp;quot;. Translations such as &amp;quot;gentleman&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;knight&amp;quot; have traditionally been suggested to convey the social aspect of the phrase, while &amp;quot;war hero&amp;quot; or the more cynical &amp;quot;martyr&amp;quot; are more recent versions, and emphasise the military element.

It became a fixed phrase by which the Athenian aristocracy referred to itself; in the ethical philosophers, the first of  whom were Athenian gentlemen, the term came to mean the ideal or perfect man.

The possession of the beautiful and the good (&amp;quot;kalos kai agathos&amp;quot;) has a correspondent in Latin: &amp;quot;[[mens sana in corpore sano]]&amp;quot; (healthy soul in healthy body). It is also seen as a target in balanced education of body and spirit.

There is thematic discussion of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;kalokagathia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Aristotle]]&amp;apos;s [[Eudemian Ethics]] Book VIII, chapter 3. And how a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;kaloskagathos&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (gentleman) should live is also discussed at length in [[Xenophon]]&amp;apos;s [[Socratic dialogues]], especially the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Oeconomicus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

== Kalos ==
The adjective καλός means beautiful and encompasses meanings equivalent to English &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;noble&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;handsome&amp;quot;. The form given by convention is the masculine, but it was equally used of women (the feminine form is καλή) and could also describe animals or inanimate objects.

[[Plato]], in his work &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, used the term τό καλόν (the neutral form) in his attempts to define ideals. However, his protagonist in the dialogue, [[Socrates]], stated that he did not fully comprehend the nature of this καλόν.

== Agathos ==
This second adjective means good and had no particular physical or aesthetic connotations, but could describe a person&amp;apos;s excellence of character (ethical virtue) for example their bravery. Again, around the 4th century, it had become politically meaningful, and carried implications of dutiful citizenship.
