&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Karen A. Holbrook&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born November 6, 1942 in [[Des Moines]], [[Iowa]]) was the 13th presiding president of [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]]. She took office on October 1, 2002, replacing Interim President [[Edward Harrington Jennings|Edward H. Jennings]]. Holbrook earned her B.S. and M.S. from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], in zoology. After teaching [[biology]] at [[Ripon College (Wisconsin)|Ripon College]], she earned a Ph.D. in biological structure from the [[University of Washington]] School of Medicine in 1972, then pursued further training in [[dermatology]].  She is an alumna of [[Gamma Phi Beta]] sorority.

Prior to leading The Ohio State University, Holbrook was a professor of biological structure and medicine at University of Washington School of Medicine, Vice president for Research and [[dean (education)|Dean]] of the Graduate School at the [[University of Florida]], and most recently Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and [[Provost (education)|Provost]] at the [[University of Georgia]]. At all points in her career Holbrook has continued to research dermatology.

In addition to her academic responsibilities, Holbrook serves on several non-profit boards, such as the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], [[Association of American Universities]], [[National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges]], [[Association of American Medical Colleges]], [[ACT (examination)|American College Testing Program]], [[American Council on Education]], [[National Merit Scholarship Corporation]], and [http://www.ncseonline.org National Council for Science and the Environment], among many others.

Holbrook resigned from Ohio State on June 30, 2007, ending her five-year career there. [[Joseph A. Alutto]], dean of the [[Max M. Fisher College of Business]] at Ohio State, replaced Holbrook as an interim president until [[Gordon Gee]] took his place as the new president.

While on an interview at [[Florida Gulf Coast University]], Holbrook was quoted as saying about Ohio State, &amp;quot;When you win a game, you riot. When you lose a game, you riot. When spring comes, you riot. African-American Heritage Festival weekend, you riot.&amp;quot; This statement angered Ohio State students and alumni and Holbrook later stated that her comments were &amp;quot;melodramatic&amp;quot; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.thelantern.com/2.1346/ex-president-expelled-1.77602 The Lantern - Ex-President Expelled]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Holbrook is currently the Vice President for Research &amp;amp; Innovation at the [[University of South Florida]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.research.usf.edu/vpfr/ University of South Florida - Office of the Vice President For Research and Innovation]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; She also serves on the [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] Board of Trustees.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.erau.edu/administration/trustees/tr-holbrook.html - Embry-Riddle Board of Trustees]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
