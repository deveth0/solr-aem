        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kaddish&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kaddish for Naomi Ginsberg (1894–1956)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a poem by [[Beat generation|Beat]] writer [[Allen Ginsberg]] about his mother Naomi and her death on June 9, 1956.

==Background==
Ginsberg began writing the poem in the [[Beat Hotel]] in [[Paris]] in December 1957 and completed in New York in 1959. The poem was published as the lead poem in the collection &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Kaddish and Other Poems]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1961).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;(&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kaddish and Other Poems 1958–1960&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by Allen Ginsberg (City Lights Books: San Francisco, 1961) [http://www.questia.com questia.com])&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is often considered one of Ginsberg&amp;apos;s finest poems, with some scholars holding that it is his best poem.

The title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kaddish&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refers to the mourner&amp;apos;s prayer or blessing in [[Judaism]].  This long poem was Ginsberg&amp;apos;s attempt to mourn his mother, Naomi, but also reflects his sense of loss at his estrangement from his born religion. The traditional [[Kaddish]] contains no references to death, whereas [[Ginsberg]]&amp;apos;s poem is riddled with thoughts and questionings of death.

==Stage version==
Ginsberg wrote a screenplay based on the poem. [[Robert Frank]] was to direct it, but money could not be raised for the project. In 1972, [[Robert Kalfin]] readapted the screenplay for the stage and produced it at the [[Chelsea Theater Center]] in the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]]. The play explored Naomi Ginsberg&amp;apos;s schizophrenic collapse and made use of innovative video for flashback scenes.

There is a detailed description of this production and of behind-the-scenes incidents surrounding it in [[Davi Napoleon]]&amp;apos;s chronicle of the Chelsea, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Chelsea on the Edge: The Adventures of an American Theater]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1991). Kalfin&amp;apos;s adaptation was also staged in the [[Habima]] theater in Israel, translated by [[Nathan Zach]] and starring [[Yoram Khatav]] as Allen and [[Gila Almagor]] as Naomi.

==Notes==
Kaddish (קדיש Aramaic: &amp;quot;holy&amp;quot;) refers to an important and central prayer in the Jewish prayer service. The central theme of the Kaddish is the magnification and sanctification of God&amp;apos;s name. In the liturgy, several variations of the Kaddish are used functionally as separators between various sections of the service. The term &amp;quot;Kaddish&amp;quot; is often used to refer specifically to &amp;quot;The Mourners&amp;apos; Kaddish&amp;quot;, said as part of the mourning rituals in Judaism in all prayer services as well as at funerals and memorials. When mention is made of &amp;quot;saying Kaddish&amp;quot;, this unambiguously denotes the rituals of mourning.
