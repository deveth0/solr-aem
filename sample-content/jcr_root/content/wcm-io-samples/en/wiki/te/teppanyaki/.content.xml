{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Teppanyaki&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|[[wikt:鉄板焼き|鉄板焼き]]|teppan-yaki}} is a style of [[Japanese cuisine]] that uses an [[iron]] [[griddle]] to cook food. The word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;teppanyaki&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is derived from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;teppan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[wikt:鉄板|鉄板]]), which means iron plate, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;yaki&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[wikt:焼き|焼き]]), which means grilled, broiled or pan-fried. In [[Japan]], teppanyaki refers to dishes cooked using an iron plate, including [[steak]], [[shrimp]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[okonomiyaki]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[yakisoba]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[monjayaki]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Modern &amp;apos;&amp;apos;teppanyaki&amp;apos;&amp;apos; grills are typically propane-heated flat surface grills, and are widely used to cook food in front of guests at restaurants. Teppanyaki grills are commonly confused with the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[hibachi]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[barbecue grill]], which has a charcoal or gas flame and is made with an open grate design.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.davrontech.com/teppanyaki-grill.aspx Teppanyaki Grills]. Accessed July 5, 2010.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; With a solid griddle type cook surface, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;teppanyaki&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is more suitable for smaller ingredients, such as rice, egg, and finely chopped vegetables.

==Origin==
The originator of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;teppanyaki&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-style steakhouse is the Japanese restaurant chain &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Misono&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which introduced the concept of cooking Western-influenced food on a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;teppan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in Japan in 1945.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.misono.org/ Misono website] {{ja}}. Accessed September 12, 2007.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  They soon found the cuisine was less popular with the Japanese than it was with foreigners, who enjoyed both watching the skilled maneuvers of the chefs preparing the food as well as the cuisine itself, which is somewhat more familiar than more traditional Japanese dishes. As the restaurants became popular at tourist spots with non-Japanese, the chain increased the performance aspect of the chef&amp;apos;s preparation, such as stacking onion slices to produce a flaming onion [[volcano]].

Another piece of equipment in the same family is a [[flattop grill]], consisting of a flat piece of steel over circular burners and typically smaller and round, like a [[Mongolian barbecue]].

==Ingredients==
Typical ingredients used for Western-style &amp;apos;&amp;apos;teppanyaki&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are [[beef]], [[shrimp]], [[scallops]], [[lobster]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] and assorted vegetables. [[Soybean oil]] is typically used to cook the ingredients.

Japanese-style &amp;apos;&amp;apos;teppanyaki&amp;apos;&amp;apos; may also use noodles (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;yakisoba&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), cabbage with sliced meat or seafood (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[okonomiyaki]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), which are cooked using regular vegetable oil, animal fat, or a mixture. In [[Japan]], many &amp;apos;&amp;apos;teppanyaki&amp;apos;&amp;apos; restaurants feature [[Kobe beef]].

Side dishes of [[mung bean|mung bean sprouts]], [[zucchini]] (even though zucchini is not a popular vegetable in Japan and rarely found in the market), garlic chips, or fried rice usually accompany the meal.  Some restaurants provide sauces in which to dip the food. In Japan, only [[soy sauce]] is typically offered.

==In North America==
Restaurants serving &amp;apos;&amp;apos;teppanyaki&amp;apos;&amp;apos; cuisine are often known as &amp;quot;Hibachi grills&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Japanese steakhouses.&amp;quot;

In the [[United States]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;teppanyaki&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was made famous by the [[Benihana]] restaurant chain, which opened its first restaurant in New York in 1964.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.benihana.com/about/history How Benihana Started] Accessed September 12, 2007&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Benihana and other chains of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;teppanyaki&amp;apos;&amp;apos; steakhouses continue to place an emphasis on the chef performing a show for the diners, continuing to introduce new variations and tricks.  The chef might juggle utensils, flip a shrimp tail into his shirt pocket, catch an egg in his hat, toss an egg up in the air and split it with a spatula, flip flattened shrimp pieces into the diners&amp;apos; mouths, or arrange onion rings into fire-shooting volcanoes.
