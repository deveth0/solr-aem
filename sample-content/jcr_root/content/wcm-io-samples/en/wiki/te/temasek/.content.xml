&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Temasek&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;Sea Town&amp;apos; in [[Javanese language| Old Javanese]], spelt &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tumasik&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was the name of an early city on the site of modern [[Singapore]]. From the 14th century, the island has also been known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Singapura&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which is derived from [[Sanskrit]] and means &amp;quot;Lion City&amp;quot;. Legend has it that the name was given by [[Sang Nila Utama]] when he visited the island in 1299 and saw an unknown creature, which he mistook as a lion.

While the early [[history of Singapore]] is obscured by myth and legend, some conclusions can be drawn from [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence and from written references by travellers. Archaeology points to an urbanised settlement on the site by the 14th century. Allusions by travellers give some evidence that there may have been a city or town present as early as the 2nd century. At its height, the city boasted a large earthen [[city wall]] and [[moat]]; many of the buildings were built with stone and brick foundations. Remains of old pottery, coins, jewellery and other artifacts have been found, with many of these artifacts believed to be imported from various parts of [[China]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Indonesia]]. These are sometimes seen as evidence of the city&amp;apos;s status as a regional trade centre. An aquatic route which is part of the larger [[Silk Road|Silk route]], passes through Temasek.

From the 7th to the 13th centuries, the island of Singapore was controlled by the [[Srivijaya]] empire based in [[Sumatra]]. By the emergence of Temasek as a fortified city and trading centre in the 14th century, the Srivijaya empire was in a long period of decline. The city was nearly conquered by the [[Majapahit]] empire in 1401 and came under the influence of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]], in the 15th century. After the fall of Malacca to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in 1511, the island came under the control of the [[Malay states|Malay]] [[Sultanate of Johor]].  When overtaken by the British, the King of Siam ordered the Garrison of Temasik to return rather than create an incident the British could use to acquire more of Siam&amp;apos;s Western border. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
