The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Terek River&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Lang-rus|Те́рек|p=ˈtʲerʲɪk}}; {{Lang-ka|თერგი}}, {{Lang|ka-Latn|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tergi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}; {{Lang-os|Терк}}, {{Lang-av| Терек}}, {{Lang|av-Latn|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Terek&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}, {{Lang-ce|Теркa}}, {{Lang|ce-Latn|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Terka&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}) is a major river in the [[Northern Caucasus]], flowing through [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and Russia into the [[Caspian Sea]].  It rises in Georgia near the juncture of the [[Caucasus Mountains|The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range]] and the [[Khokh Range]], to the southwest of [[Mount Kazbek]], winding north in a white torrent between the town of Stephantsminda and the village of Gergeti [1]  toward the Russian region [[North Ossetia]] and the city of [[Vladikavkaz]].  It turns east to flow through [[Chechnya]] and [[Dagestan]] before [[Water divide|dividing into two branches]] which empty into the [[Caspian Sea]].  Below the city of [[Kizlyar]] it forms a swampy [[river delta]] around {{Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide. Major inflows are [[Gizeldon]], [[Ardon River|Ardon]], [[Urukh]], [[Fiagdon]], [[Malka River|Malka]], [[Baksan River|Baksan]] and [[Sunzha]] rivers. The river is a key natural asset in the region, being used for [[irrigation]] and [[hydroelectric power]] in its upper reaches.

The main cities on the Terek are [[Vladikavkaz]], [[Mozdok, Republic of North Ossetia–Alania|Mozdok]], and [[Kizlyar]]. Several minor [[hydroelectrostation]] are constructed on Terek: [[Dzau electrostation]] (in Vladikavkaz), Bekanskaya and Pavlodolskaya.

==Human history==
The capital of [[Khazaria]] [[Samandar (city)|Samandar]] was possibly placed at the bank of the river.

The Terek river was the site of the final defeat of the [[Hulagu]], [[Khan (title)|khan]] of the [[Ilkhanate]], Army, against the army of [[Berke]], khan of the [[Golden Horde]], led by [[Nogai Khan]], in the first civil war of the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Berke–Hulagu war]]. Also is the site of a battle that [[Battle of the Terek River|Timur defeated Tokhtamysh]] in 1395.

It was home to the [[Terek Cossack]] Host.
