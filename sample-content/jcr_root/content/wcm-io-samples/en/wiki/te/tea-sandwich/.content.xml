A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;tea sandwich&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small prepared [[sandwich]] meant to be eaten at [[tea (meal)|afternoon teatime]] to stave off hunger until the main [[meal]].

The tea sandwich may take a number of different forms, but should be easy to handle, and should be capable of being eaten in two bites. It may be a long, narrow sandwich, a triangular half-sandwich, or a small biscuit. It may also be cut into other decorative shapes with a [[cookie cutter]].

The [[bread]] is traditionally white, thinly sliced, and [[butter]]ed. The bread crust is cut away cleanly from the sandwich after the sandwich has been prepared but before serving. Modern bread variations might include [[wheat]], [[pumpernickel]], [[sour dough]] or [[rye bread]].

Fillings are light, and are &amp;quot;dainty&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;delicate&amp;quot; in proportion to the amount of bread. Spreads might include [[cream cheese]] or [[mayonnaise]] mixtures, and the sandwiches often feature fresh [[vegetable]]s such as [[radish]]es, [[cucumber]], [[asparagus]], or [[watercress]]. The [[cucumber sandwich|cucumber tea sandwich]] in particular is considered the quintessential tea sandwich. Other popular tea sandwich fillings include [[pimento cheese]], [[ham]] with mustard, [[smoked salmon]], fruit [[jam]], [[curry|curried]] [[chicken]], and [[egg salad]].
