&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;TEJO&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tutmonda Esperantista Junulara Organizo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;World Esperanto Youth Organization&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  TEJO was founded in 1938 under the name Tutmonda Junular-Organizo (World Youth Organization).  The current name was taken in 1952.  In 1956, TEJO became the youth section of the [[World Esperanto Association]] (Universala Esperanto-Asocio, UEA).  In 1971, the finances and administration of TEJO were fully integrated into the UEA.

TEJO is an [[youth organization|organization]] for young speakers of [[Esperanto]].  TEJO has individual members as well as member organizations.  There are 42+ member organizations plus about 13 national organizations that TEJO has contact with but which are not yet members.

TEJO organizes an [[International Youth Congress of Esperanto]] (Internacia Junulara Kongreso) each year in a different location around the world.  The IJK is an event of concerts, presentations, excursions, and recreation, usually of one week&amp;apos;s duration and attended by a few hundred young people from many different countries.

TEJO also publishes the [[Pasporta Servo]] which is a hospitality network of Esperanto-speakers around the world willing to accept Esperanto-speaking guests.

TEJO publishes a magazine called [[Kontakto]], aimed at beginners and young readers.

TEJO organizes several youth seminars each year.  These seminars bring together an international group of young people to discuss a current issue.  Past seminars have focused on [[human rights]], [[globalization]], language problems, and the [[Internet]].  The seminars last for one week and often contain a training component so that participants not only take part in an international discussion, but leave having been taught new skills.
