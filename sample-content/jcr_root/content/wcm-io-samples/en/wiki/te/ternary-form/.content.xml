        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ternary form&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, sometimes called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;song form&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;HD2nd binary and ternary&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; is a three-part [[musical form]], usually schematized as A–B–A. The first and third parts (A) are musically identical, or very nearly so, while the second part (B) in some way provides a contrast with them. The B section is often called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;trio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, especially in [[minuet]]s and [[scherzo|scherzi]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;HD2nd trio (2)&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; Examples include [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Folk Song&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Album for the Young]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Op. 68, No. 9) and [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]&amp;apos;s [[Prelude, Op. 28, No. 15 (Chopin)|Prelude in D-Flat Major]] (Op. 28).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;White, John D. (1976). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Analysis of Music&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, pp. 53–54. ISBN 0-13-033233-X.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Characteristics==
In ternary form, unlike the rounded [[binary form]], each section will usually be self-contained both [[theme (music)|thematically]] and [[tonality|tonally]] (that is, each section contains distinct and complete themes, and ends with an [[cadence (music)#Authentic cadence|authentic cadence]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;HD2nd binary and ternary&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; The B section is generally in a contrasting, but [[closely related key]], usually the [[dominant key]] of the first section&amp;apos;s [[tonic (music)|tonic]] (a [[perfect fifth]] above) or the [[Relative key|relative]] or [[Parallel key|parallel]] minor or major,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;HD2nd binary and ternary&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; less often the [[subdominant]] key (a perfect fifth below). It usually also has a contrasting character; in a [[march (music)|march]], for example, the highly rhythmic and strident character of the march itself is usually contrasted with a more lyrical and flowing trio in the subdominant, and often in a [[Triple metre|3/4]] [[time signature]] as opposed to the 4/4 of the primary march theme.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

A distinction is sometimes made{{by whom?|date=August 2011}} between &amp;quot;compound ternary form&amp;quot; – in which each large part of the form is itself divided in a way to suggest ternary or binary form (giving, for example, an overall scheme of {{Nowrap|A–B–A–C–D–C–A–B–A)}} – and &amp;quot;simple ternary form&amp;quot;, in which each large part of the form has no particular structure itself. [[Da capo aria|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Da capo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; arias]] are usually in simple ternary form; minuets (or scherzos) and trios are normally compound {{Nowrap|[(1A–1A–1B–1B) (2A–2A-2B-2B) (1A-1B)]}}. Another name for the latter is &amp;quot;composite ternary form&amp;quot;.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The repetition of any section results in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;expanded ternary form&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Benward &amp;amp; Saker&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

Commonly, the third section will feature more ornamentation than the first section (as is often the case with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;da capo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; arias). In these cases the last section is sometimes labeled A’ or A1 to indicate that it is slightly different from the first A section.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Usage==
As well as in marches, ternary form is often found in [[baroque music|baroque]] [[opera]] [[aria]]s (the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;da capo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; aria) and in many dance forms, such as [[polka]]s. It is also the form used in the minuet (or scherzo) and trio, which, in the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]], was usually the third movement of [[symphony|symphonies]], [[string quartet]]s, [[sonata]]s and similar works.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}
