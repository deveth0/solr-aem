&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tender Vittles&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a brand of [[cat food]] manufactured by [[Nestlé]] under the Purina name.  The cat food was previously made by [[Ralston Purina Company]], which was purchased by Nestlé. The name is a phonetic spelling of the phrase &amp;quot;Tender Victuals&amp;quot;, which tended to be mispronounced by consumers.

As of March 2007, the Tender Vittles product line was discontinued in the United States. It was discontinued because the semi-moist food, with high sugar and salt content, caused health problems for cats.

== In popular culture ==
* In the [[Futurama]] episode 3ACV11 &amp;quot;Insane in the Mainframe&amp;quot;, Bender suggests that Fry retire on Tender Vittles after Fry loses his retirement fund on scratch and sniff lottery tickets.

*In the Futurama episode &amp;quot;That Darn Katz,&amp;quot; the leader of the hyper-intelligent cats says that when they first came to earth, during the time of the Egyptians, they became domesticated because the Egyptians provided them with &amp;quot;feasts most fancy, and vittles most tender,&amp;quot; in reference to Fancy Feast cat food and Tender Vittles.

*In the Venture Bros episode &amp;quot;Operation P.R.O.M.&amp;quot; Sgt. Hatred states that he got his previous tattoo removed, except for the area over his equatorial region, stating that it&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Tender Vittles down there&amp;quot;.

*In Berkeley Breathed&amp;apos;s comic strip Bloom County the character Bill the Cat was described as being addicted to getting high from snorting Tender Vittles.
