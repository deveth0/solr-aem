&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Temperate coniferous forest&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] [[biome]] found in [[temperate]] regions of the world with warm [[summer]]s and cool [[winter]]s and adequate [[rain]]fall to sustain a [[forest]]. In most temperate coniferous forests, evergreen [[conifer]]s predominate, while some are a mix of conifers and broadleaf [[evergreen]] trees and/or broadleaf [[deciduous]] [[tree]]s. Temperate evergreen forests are common in the [[coast]]al areas of regions that have mild winters and heavy rainfall, or inland in drier [[climate]]s or [[mountain]] areas. Coniferous forests can be found in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Many species of tree inhabit these forests including [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[Cupressaceae|cypress]], [[Douglas fir]], [[fir]], [[juniper]], [[kauri]], [[pine]], [[podocarpus]], [[spruce]], [[Sequoioideae|redwood]] and [[Taxaceae|yew]]. The understory also contains a wide variety of herbaceous and [[shrub]] species.

Structurally, these forests are rather simple, generally consisting of two layers: an overstory and understory. Some forests may support an intermediate layer of shrubs. [[Pine]] forests support a herbaceous understory that is generally dominated by [[grass]]es and herbaceous perennials, and are often subject to ecologically important [[wildfire]]s.

[[Temperate rain forest]]s occur only in seven regions around the world: the [[Pacific temperate rain forests]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]], the [[Valdivian temperate rain forests]] of southwestern [[South America]], the rain forests of [[New Zealand]] and [[Tasmania]], [[northwest Europe]] (small pockets in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Iceland]] and a somewhat larger area in [[Norway]]), southern [[Japan]], and the eastern [[Black Sea]]-[[Caspian Sea]] region of [[Turkey]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to northern [[Iran]]. The moist conditions of temperate rain forests generally support an understory of [[moss]]es, [[fern]]s and some shrubs. Temperate rain forests can be temperate coniferous forests or [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]]s.

==Species==

The temperate coniferous rain forests sustain the highest levels of biomass in any terrestrial ecosystem and are notable for trees of massive proportions, including [[Sequoia sempervirens|coast redwood]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sequoia sempervirens&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), [[Douglas fir]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pseudotsuga menziesii&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Picea sitchensis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), [[Fitzroya cupressoides|Alerce]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fitzroya cupressoides&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and [[Agathis|kauri]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Agathis australis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). These forests are quite rare, occurring in small areas of [[North America]], southwestern South America and northern New Zealand. The [[Klamath-Siskiyou forests]] of northwestern [[California]] and southwestern [[Oregon]] is known for its rich variety of plant and animal species, including many endemic species.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;
