== Postal System==
[[Direction des services postaux de l’Office National des Postes et de l&amp;apos;Épargne]] is responsible for the postal service.

==Telephone Network==
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The national network for fixed phones&amp;apos;&amp;apos; consists of some [[Panaftel]] [[microwave]] radio relay links (from Bangui to Bossembele, Baoro, Carnot, Berberati and on to Gamboula on the border with Cameroon). This microwave network has however never been used, since the equipment requires electricity for the repeaters that are located every {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The current fixed-lines outside [[Bangui]] are transmitted through a DOMSAT network installed in the early 1990s as a star formation around the Bangui satellite earth station (1 [[Intelsat]]). There are about 90000 fixed-lines subscribers (2003).
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;GSM coverage&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was for a long time limited to the capital area. But in June 2006 coverage was expanded at least to Berberati in the western part of the country. There are currently two GSM-900 mobile operators, Telecel CAR and Nationlink Telecom RCA. A third network, Centrafrique Telecom Plus closed down in late 2005 after failing to attract more than 5,000 subscribers and after failing to renew its license, in accordance to the new Bozize government.
* [[Socatel]] is the country&amp;apos;s leading [[telecommunications]] and [[internet service provider]].
