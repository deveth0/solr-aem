&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eco-Money&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the name of many [[Japan]]ese [[community currency|community currencies]], used to connect neighbours in obtaining the goods and services they need.

Eco-money may also be used to describe forms of [[alternative currency]] and [[complementary currency]] that encourage ecological and socially responsible actions in other regions as well.

In the town of [[Kuriyama, Hokkaidō|Kuriyama]], [[Hokkaidō]], for instance, second grader Ami Hasegawa paid 1,000 kurins to get her favorite toy fixed. The [[Kurin]] is the local [[currency]] that was named after the township. Ami&amp;apos;s father earned 3,000 kurins for fixing the handrail of a staircase in a neighbor&amp;apos;s house. And her mother paid 1,000 kurins to an elderly man who wrote addresses for her on postcards in beautiful handwriting.

In spring 1999 [[Kusatsu, Shiga|Kusatsu]] in [[Shiga Prefecture]] became the first city in Japan to use eco-money, calling it the Ohmi, which is what the prefecture was called in the old days. Several other cities followed suit with currencies of their own, with [[Matsue, Shimane|Matsue]], [[Shimane Prefecture]], calling it the dagger (borrowed from the local dialect) and [[Takaoka, Toyama|Takaoka]] in [[Toyama Prefecture]].

Some 30 more communities across Japan are introducing such currencies. Some municipalities plan to use the money to plant trees and reduce garbage.

Eco-Money Network Secretary General [[Masanari Nakayama]] stated, &amp;quot;Eco-money is a way of getting neighbors to help each other out and to deepen their ties to the community.&amp;quot;
