&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ecgfrith&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was king of [[Mercia]] from July to December 796. He was the son of [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]], the greatest king of Mercia, and [[Cynethryth]].&amp;lt;ref name =BiogDic&amp;gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=A Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain|editors=Ann Williams, Alfred P.

Ecgfrith was succeeded by a distant relative, [[Coenwulf of Mercia|Cœnwulf]], apparently because Offa had arranged the murder of nearer relatives in order to eliminate dynastic rivals. According to a contemporary letter from [[Alcuin of York]], an English deacon and scholar who spent over a decade at [[Charlemagne]]&amp;apos;s court as one of his chief advisors:&amp;lt;ref name=BEASE_24&amp;gt;Lapidge, &amp;quot;Alcuin of York&amp;quot;, in Lapidge et al., &amp;quot;Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England&amp;quot;, p.&amp;amp;nbsp;24.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
:That most noble young man has not died for his sins, but the vengeance for the blood shed by the father has reached the son. For you know how much blood his father shed to secure the kingdom upon his son.&amp;lt;ref name =BiogDic/&amp;gt;

Alcuin added: &amp;quot;This was not a strengthening of the kingdom, but its ruin.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=EHD_786&amp;gt;Letter of Alcuin to Mercian ealdorman Osbert, tr. in Whitelock, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;English Historical Documents&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p.&amp;amp;nbsp;787&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
