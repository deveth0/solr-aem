The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;eco-warrior&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a self-description for an [[environmentalist|environmental]] [[activist]] that adopts a &amp;apos;hands-on&amp;apos; effort to save a plot of land. In the UK it was the media that coined the term in the 1990s, a label that many people actively taking ecological direct action resisted, for philosophical reasons.

A common symbol of an  eco-warrior is the [[Eco Warriors Flag]].

Another use of the term refers to an environmental activist who engages in illegal activities, also known as [[eco-terrorism]]. However, an eco-warrior is also someone who utilizes the [[court]]s to halt, suspend, or otherwise derail a human activity that the activist believes adversely impacts the environment.

==Types==
An eco-warrior can be someone who engages in an environmental organisation (e.g. Greenpeace) or an environmental company that delivers safekeeping or improvements for the environment (e.g. directly by selling environmental products as environmentally friendly cars, or indirectly by carbon dioxide offsets).

== Notable eco-warriors and warrior actions ==
* In 2006, an eco-warrior group who sabotaged heavily polluting terrain vehicles became known in Paris (France), calling themselves &amp;apos;[[Les Dégonflés]]&amp;apos;.
* Another well-known British &amp;quot;eco-warrior&amp;quot; is Daniel Hooper, who is also known as [[Swampy]].
* [[Chico Mendes]] and [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]] are the most famous green activists in Brazil and Nigeria, respectively.
* Made famous in the US for a hurling a brick through the window of a McDonald&amp;apos;s during the so-called &amp;quot;Battle in Seattle&amp;quot;, French activist and small-scale cheese farmer [[José Bové]] has been fighting neo-liberalism on his home turf for decades.
* [[Paul Watson]] and the direct-action conservation group known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which he founded, can be called eco-warriors for their direct engagements of ships engaging in overfishing and commercial whaling.
* [[Penti Baihua]] is an internationally known [[Huaorani]]. The Huaorani, like many other [[indigenous people]]s, are very much interested in putting a stop to illegal logging on their homeland, and also embrace the concept of [[ecotourism]] to supply in funds to help in the protection of their local biodiversity.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.guilfordian.com/sports/alliance-of-forest-people-discuss-deforestation-1.327158 &amp;quot;Alliance of Forest People discuss deforestation&amp;quot;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
*  [[Timothy Treadwell]] was an activist for the protection of grizzly bears in Alaska.
