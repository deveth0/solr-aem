&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eclecticism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a kind of mixed style in the [[fine arts]]: &amp;quot;the borrowing of a variety of [[Art movement|style]]s from different sources and combining them&amp;quot; (Hume 1998, 5). Significantly, Eclecticism hardly ever constituted a specific style in [[art]]: it is characterized by the fact that it was not a particular style. In general, the term describes the combination in a single work of a variety of influences &amp;amp;mdash; mainly of elements from different historical styles in [[architecture]], [[painting]], and the [[graphic arts|graphic]] and [[decorative arts]]. In [[music]] the term used may be either [[Eclecticism in music|eclecticism]], [[crossover (music)|crossover music]], or [[polystylism]].

The process of the [[synthesis]] and/or [[entropy]] of arts.  This is not a complete sentence. Is it meant to go on (e.g., &amp;quot;becomes an important strand in contemporary society&amp;quot;), or is it meant to begin with &amp;quot;It is&amp;quot;?--&amp;gt;  A mixing and gelling of existing artistic elements which then create a new genre; thereby increasing the total pool of existing sources of influence on future perspectives.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}&amp;lt;!--This does not appear to be supported by any cited statements in the body of the article. Neither is it a complete sentence.--&amp;gt;

==In the visual arts==
The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;eclectic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was first used by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] to characterize the art of the [[The Carracci|Carracci]], who incorporated in their paintings elements from the [[Renaissance]] and [[Art in ancient Greece#Classical|classic]]al traditions. Indeed, [[Agostino Carracci|Agostino]], [[Annibale Carracci|Annibale]] and [[Lodovico Carracci]] had tried to combine in their art [[Michelangelo]]&amp;apos;s line, [[Titian]]&amp;apos;s [[color]], [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]]&amp;apos;s [[chiaroscuro]], and [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]&amp;apos;s [[symmetry]] and [[wiktionary:grace|grace]].

In the 18th century, [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], head of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in [[London]], was one of the most influential advocates of eclecticism. In the sixth of his famous academical &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Discourses&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1774), he wrote that the painter may use the work of the ancients as a &amp;quot;magazine of common property, always open to the public, whence every man has a right to take what materials he pleases&amp;quot; (Reynolds 1775). {{Page needed|date=September 2008}} In 19th-century [[England]], [[John Ruskin]] also pleaded for eclecticism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Western architecture==
{{see also|Victorian architecture|Revivalism (architecture)}}
Eclecticism &amp;quot;was an important concept in Western architecture during the mid- and late 19th century, and it reappeared in a new guise in the latter part of the 20th century&amp;quot; (Muthesius 2008).
