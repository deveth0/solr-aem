&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ylva Julia Margareta Johansson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 13 February 1964) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[politician]] who served as [[Ministry of Education (Sweden)|Minister for Schools]] from 1994 to 1998 and as [[Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (Sweden)|Minister for Welfare and Elderly Healthcare]] from 2004 to 2006. She has been a [[List of members of the Riksdag|member]] of the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish Riksdag]] since 2006, and is currently deputy chairman in the [[Labour economics|committee on the labour market]] and spokesperson of labour market issues for the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]].

== Biography ==

Ylva Johansson studied at [[Lund University]] and the [[Stockholm Institute of Education]] 1983-88 and 1991–92 and holds a [[Master of Science]] in education. In the [[Swedish parliamentary election, 1988|1988 general elections]] she was elected as a [[List of members of the Swedish Riksdag, 2006-2010|member]] of the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]] for the [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party - Communists]] (VPK). She later left the party and joined the Social Democrats.

From 1992 to 1994 she worked as a teacher, until [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] [[Ingvar Carlsson]] made her Minister for Schools in his government. In 1998, in a somewhat unusual [[News release|press release]], she and the then Minister for Finance [[Erik Åsbrink]] announced their wish to &amp;quot;publicly confirm that we are in love&amp;quot; and their intention to separate from their respective partners. Soon afterwards, Ylva Johansson left the government. The following years, she worked in the private sector.

In 2004, Prime Minister [[Göran Persson]] appointed Ylva Johansson to the government in a new position, as Minister for Health and Elderly Care, succeeding [[Lars Engqvist]].

She has two children with her former husband [[Bo Hammar]] and a son with Erik Åsbrink.
