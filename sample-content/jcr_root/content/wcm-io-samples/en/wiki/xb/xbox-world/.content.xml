&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xbox World&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Xbox]] and [[Xbox 360]] magazine published by [[Future plc]].

== History ==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xbox World 360&amp;apos;&amp;apos; began life as Xbox World, with issue one released in early 2003, over a year after the [[Xbox|Xbox&amp;apos;s]] release. Published by Computec Media, the editor at launch was Pat Garratt (now of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Eurogamer]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), and the managing editor was former &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[CU Amiga]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; editor Tony Horgan.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xbox World&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, alongside sister magazine &amp;apos;&amp;apos;PlayStation World&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was acquired by Future plc in late 2003. The majority of the staff departed during the magazine&amp;apos;s move from [[London]] to Future&amp;apos;s [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] offices. The editor for the first Future-published Xbox World was Lee Hall.

In September 2005, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xbox World&amp;apos;&amp;apos; relaunched as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xbox World 360&amp;apos;&amp;apos; under the guidance of former [[NGC Magazine|NGC]] editor Tim Weaver. It contains an achievements/hint/cheats/walkthrough book and a double sided four-hour disc including a DVD side and a HD side to be run on the Xbox 360.

In the November 2011 issue, the magazine was revamped and reverted back to its original name of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xbox World&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The Christmas 2011 issue was Tim Weaver&amp;apos;s last issue as editor of the magazine. He is now the managing editor, while [[PSM3]]&amp;apos;s Andy Hartup took over as editor.

On 13 November 2012, it was announced that both Xbox World and sister magazine PSM3 are to be closed down by publisher Future. The final issue of both magazines went on sale on 12 December 2012.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.computerandvideogames.com/377968/xbox-world-and-psm3-magazines-to-close/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
