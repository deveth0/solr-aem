&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Saint Lucia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a member of several internal organizations, including the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS). It maintains friendly relations with the major powers active in the [[Caribbean]], including the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], and [[France]].

St. Lucia participated in the [[United States of America|American-led]] [[invasion of Grenada]] in 1983, sending members of its Special Services Unit into active duty. It was subsequently one of eight countries to cast a vote against a [[United Nations General Assembly]] motion condemning the invasion.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Richard Bernstein, &amp;quot;U.N. ASSEMBLY ADOPTS MEASURE &amp;apos;DEEPLY DEPLORING&amp;apos; INVASION OF ISLE,&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;New York Times&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 3 November 1983. The other countries were the United States, [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Barbados]], [[Dominica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Israel]], [[Jamaica]], and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

As a member of CARICOM, St. Lucia strongly backed efforts by the United States to implement [[UN Security Council Resolution 940]], designed to restore democracy to [[Haiti]]. The country agreed to contribute personnel to the multinational force, which restored the democratically elected government of Haiti in October 1994.

St. Lucia participated, along with 14 other Caribbean nations, in a summit with US President [[Bill Clinton]] in [[Bridgetown, Barbados]], in May 1997. The summit, which was the first-ever meeting in the region between the U.S. and Caribbean heads of government, strengthened the basis for regional cooperation on justice and counternarcotics, finance and development, and trade issues.

St. Lucia had official diplomatic relations with the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) for about 13 years, but switched recognition to the [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China]] (PRC) in 1997.  On 25 April 2007, the [[Premier of the Republic of China]] [[Su Tseng-chang]], announced that St. Lucia and the ROC would resume formal diplomatic relations.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2007/04/26/2003358246 &amp;quot;St. Lucia dumps PRC for Taiwan&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/ The Taipei Times], 2007-04-26&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; On May 1, 2007, St. Lucia regained diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://tw.news.yahoo.com/article/url/d/a/070501/17/dnfk.html 「台聖復交／加勒比海島國　人口17萬　出過兩位諾貝爾獎主」]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ET today, 2007/05/01 10:37&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Within a few days, the People’s Republic of China suspended diplomatic relations.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/274392/1/.html China suspends ties with St Lucia]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ChannelNewsAsia, 5/5/07&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Saint Lucia]] has no extant international disputes aside from tension resulting from the island&amp;apos;s status as a transit point for [[South America]]n [[Hard and soft drugs|drug]]s destined for the [[United States]] and [[Europe]].

Saint Lucia&amp;apos;s Permanent Representative (or [[ambassador]]) to the [[United Nations]] is [[Anthony Severin]].
