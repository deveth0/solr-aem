        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fort Mojave Indian Reservation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[Indian reservation]] along the [[Colorado River]], currently encompassing 23,669 [[acre]]s (96&amp;amp;nbsp;km²) in [[Arizona]], 12,633 acres (51&amp;amp;nbsp;km²) in [[California]], and 5,582 acres (23&amp;amp;nbsp;km²) in [[Nevada]]. The reservation was originally established in 1870 and is now home to approximately 1,100 members of the [[Mohave people|Mohave]] Tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].

Occupancy on Fort Mojave Indian Reservation lands, unlike that of many other Indian reservations in Arizona, is less than 50% Native American. The [[Mohave people]] have leased much of their land to [[cotton]], [[maize|corn]], and [[soybean]] farming companies, which employ a large population of resident [[white people]] and [[Mexican American]]s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;amp;-context=dt&amp;amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&amp;amp;-CHECK_SEARCH_RESULTS=N&amp;amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;amp;-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_P001&amp;amp;-tree_id=4001&amp;amp;-redoLog=true&amp;amp;-all_geo_types=Y&amp;amp;-transpose=N&amp;amp;-_caller=geoselect&amp;amp;-geo_id=25000US1235&amp;amp;-geo_id=26000US123504&amp;amp;-geo_id=26000US123506&amp;amp;-geo_id=26000US123532&amp;amp;-search_results=ALL&amp;amp;-fully_or_partially=N&amp;amp;-format=&amp;amp;-_lang=en&amp;amp;-show_geoid=Y Fort Mojave Reservation and Off-Reservation Trust Land, Arizona/California/Nevada] United States Census Bureau&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The site of the former [[Fort Mohave]] and the eastern terminus of the [[Mojave Road]] are situated on the present-day Fort Mojave Indian Reservation.

==History==
On October 20, 2003, the reservation government announced an agreement between the reservation and California Governor [[Gray Davis]] to allow the operation of an off-reservation [[casino]] west of [[Needles, California]] (directly across the Colorado River from the Tribe&amp;apos;s Arizona Reservation Lands).  If the deal is ratified, the Fort Mojave Reservation will be the first to have casinos in three states; the reservation operates the [[Avi Resort &amp;amp; Casino]] in Nevada and the [[Spirit Mountain Casino (Arizona)|Spirit Mountain Casino]] in Arizona.

==Language revitalization==
As of 2012, The Center for Indian Education at [[Arizona State University]] &amp;quot;has facilitated workshops for both learners and speakers at the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation in northwest Arizona, California and Nevada. Fort Mojave has about 22 elders who speak some [[Mojave language|Mojave]].&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite news
