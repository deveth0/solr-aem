A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;footpath&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;pedestrian way&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;walking trail&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;nature trail&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a type of [[thoroughfare]] that is intended primary for use by [[pedestrian]]s, but not other forms of traffic such as [[Motor vehicle|motorized vehicles]] and [[horseback]]. They can be paths within an urban area that offer more expedient or safer routes, or rural paths, such as a [[trail]] through the countryside.

==Terminology==
The terms &amp;apos;&amp;apos;shared-use path&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;separated-use path&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;multi-use path&amp;apos;&amp;apos; may be used if pedestrians and other forms of traffic make use of the same thoroughfare. The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Footpath&amp;apos;&amp;apos; can also be used to describe a pavement / [[sidewalk]] in some English speaking countries.

In some regions of the [[United Kingdom]], such as [[England]] and [[Wales]], there are [[Rights of way in England and Wales|rights of way]] on which pedestrians have a legally protected right to travel.

[[National parks]], [[nature preserve]]s, [[conservation area]]s and other protected [[wilderness]] areas may have [[trails]] that are restricted to pedestrians.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.nps.gov/vafo/planyourvisit/hikingtrails.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Construction materials==
Footpaths may be constructed of [[masonry]], [[brick]], poured or modular unit [[concrete]], cut [[stone]] or [[boardwalk|wood boardwalk]]. Also [[crushed rock]], [[decomposed granite]], fine [[wood chips]] are commonly used. The construction materials can vary over the length of the footpath and may start with a well constructed hard surface in an urban area, and end with an inexpensive soft or loose surface in the countryside.

==Footpath Issues==
Footpaths do have drawbacks. The main issues include [[maintenance]], [[litter]], [[crime]], and [[Street lighting|lighting after dark]]. As many footpaths can be in remote locations, it can be difficult to provide needed routine maintenance to them. [[Solar lighting]] is an option for safer footpaths.

==Types of footpaths==

Footpaths can be located in many settings for varied uses and experiences. As a few examples, these can include:
* [[park]]s: for means of convenient, recreational, and aesthetic, movement in and through [[public spaces|public space]]s, [[urban park]]s, neighborhood parks, [[linear park]]s, [[botanic garden]]s, and regional parks.
* in gardens and [[landscape design|designed landscapes]]: in private gardens, at school, university and [[business park]] [[campus]]es; and at park [[visitors center]]s as natural history interpretive [[nature trails]] in designed [[wildlife garden]]s.
* in [[sculpture garden]]s and [[open air museum]]s, as [[sculpture trail]]s and historic [[interpretive]] trails.
* in a wilderness setting, such as a day-[[trail]] or [[long-distance trail]] within a protected [[nature reserve]], such as a [[national park]], from a [[trailhead]].
* as [[jogging]] or running paths.
* as [[Disability|disability handicapped]] and [[wheelchair]] accessible paths meeting [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] specifications in [[sensory garden]]s and all the above settings.
