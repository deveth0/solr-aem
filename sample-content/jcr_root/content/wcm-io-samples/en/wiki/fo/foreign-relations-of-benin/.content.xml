{{Politics of Benin}}

After seizing power in 1972 Major [[Mathieu Kérékou]] declared [[Dahomey]] a [[Marxist-Leninist]] state and sought financial support from communist governments in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Asia]]. To distance the modern state from its colonial past, the country became the People&amp;apos;s Republic of Benin in 1975. However, [[Benin]] dropped the socialist ideology in 1989 following pressure from creditors and domestic unrest related to economic hardship.

In recent years Benin has strengthened ties with [[France]], the former colonial power, as well as the [[United States]] and the main international lending institutions. Benin has also adopted a mediating role in the political crises in [[Liberia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], and [[Togo]] and provided a contribution to the [[United Nations]] force in [[Haiti]], all of which were indications of the country&amp;apos;s growing confidence in the international community.

===Togo===

===United States===
{{main|Benin-United States relations}}

The two nations have had an excellent history of relations in the years since Benin embraced [[democracy]]. The U.S. Government continues to assist Benin with the improvement of living standards that are key to the ultimate success of Benin&amp;apos;s experiment with democratic government and economic liberalization, and are consistent with U.S. values and national interest in reducing [[poverty]] and promoting growth. The bulk of the U.S. effort in support of consolidating democracy in Benin is focused on long-term human resource development through [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID) programs.&amp;lt;ref name=bn&amp;gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6761.htm &amp;quot;Background Note: Benin&amp;quot;].
