&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sierra Leone]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; maintains formal relations with many Western nations.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.embassiesabroad.com/embassies-in/SierraLeone&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It also maintains diplomatic relations with the former Soviet Bloc countries as well as with the [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China]]. Former President Stevens&amp;apos; government had sought closer relations with West African countries under the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/World-Leaders-2003/Sierra-Leone-FOREIGN-POLICY.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The present government is continuing this effort.

Sierra Leone is a member of the [[United Nations]] and its specialized agencies, the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], the [[African Union]], the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the [[African Development Bank]] (AFDB), the [[Mano River Union]] (MRU), the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC), and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM).

U.S. relations with Sierra Leone began with [[missionary]] activities in the 19th century. In 1959, the U.S. opened a [[consulate]] in [[Freetown]] and elevated it to [[embassy]] status when Sierra Leone became independent in 1961. U.S.-Sierra Leone relations today are cordial, with ethnic ties between groups in the two countries receiving increasing historical interest. Many thousands of Sierra Leoneans reside in the United States. In fiscal year 2006, total U.S. bilateral aid to Sierra Leone in all categories were $29.538 million. U.S. assistance focused on the consolidation of peace, democracy and human rights, health education, particularly combating HIV/AIDS, and human resources development.

Currently, the Principal U.S. Official in Sierra Leone is Chargé d&amp;apos;Affaires Glenn Fedzer &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://freetown.usembassy.gov/ Embassy of the United States in Sierra Leone]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Sierra Leone&amp;apos;s Ambassador to the U.S. is H. E. Bockari Kortu Stevens and the Sierra Leone embassy is located in [[Washington, D.C|Washington]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web  |title=Embassy of Sierra Leone  |publisher=Sierra Leone government|date=2008-04-11

==Disputes, international==

Large UN peacekeeping presence ended civil war, however rebel gang fighting, ethnic rivalries, illegal diamond trading, corruption, and refugees spill over into neighboring states that are beset with their own civil disorders, refugees, and violence.
