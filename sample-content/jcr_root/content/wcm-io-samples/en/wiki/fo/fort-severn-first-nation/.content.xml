&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fort Severn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[First Nations|First Nation]] is located on [[Hudson Bay]] and is the most [[Extreme communities of Canada|northern community]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].
As of 2001, the population was 401, consisting of 90 families in an area of 40 square kilometres.  The legal name of the reserve is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fort Severn 89&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; most [[Indian reserve]]s in Canada have a number after the name.

The town is linked by [[winter road|winter]]/[[ice road]] called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wapusk Trail]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the winter to [[Peawanuck, Ontario]] in the east, and [[Shamattawa, Manitoba|Shamattawa]] and [[Gillam, Manitoba]] to the west.

Fort Severn is [[police]]d by the [[Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service]], an Aboriginal-based service.

== History ==
This area was inhabited for thousands of years by varying cultures of [[indigenous peoples]].  At the time of European contact, the historic [[Ojibwa]], an [[Anishinaabe]]-speaking people, lived in the area.

In 1689 the [[Hudson&amp;apos;s Bay Company]] built Fort Severn at this site; it was one of the earliest [[English people|English]] [[fur trade|fur trading]] posts in the [[New World]]. After years of international competition between the English and French, with their wars playing out in North America, the French attacked the outpost and [[Hudson Bay Expedition|pillaged it]] in 1782 when they were allies of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].

In the early 20th century, when the federal government negotiated a treaty with the First Nations, it set aside land for a native reserve in the [[Rocksand]] area at the confluence of the [[Severn River (northern Ontario)|Severn]] and [[Sachigo River|Sachigo]] Rivers, with the consent of the leaders at the time. In 1973, the reserve was relocated to the mouth of the Severn River on [[Hudson Bay]], for more direct access to shipping.  The reserve achieved full status on January 11, 1980.
