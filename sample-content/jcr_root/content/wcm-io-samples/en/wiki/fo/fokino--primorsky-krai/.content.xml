&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fokino&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Фо́кино}}) is a [[closed city|closed]] [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|town]] in [[Primorsky Krai]], [[Russia]], situated on the coast of the [[Peter the Great Gulf]] between [[Vladivostok]] and [[Nakhodka]], on the [[Abrek Bay]], about {{convert|45|km|sp=us}} south of Vladivostok. Population: {{ru-census2010|23,696|;}} {{ru-census2002|26,457|.}}

==History==
The village of [[Promyslovka]] was founded on the current site of Fokino in 1891.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} Promyslovka was granted [[urban-type settlement]] status in 1958, and the nearby naval village of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tikhookeansky&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; followed suite in 1963. The settlements grew together, were merged and granted town status on October&amp;amp;nbsp;4, 1980.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} However, due to its status as a base for the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Russian Pacific Fleet]], the town was [[closed city|closed]], and referred to officially under the code name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shkotovo-17&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} Since 1994, Fokino has been the official name of the town.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}

After the APEC-2012 Summit will be held in [[Vladivostok]], Fokino will become the main naval base at the Russian Far East, where the Russian Pacific Fleet will be attached.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with two [[urban-type settlement]]s, incorporated as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fokino [[City of federal subject significance|Town Under Krai Jurisdiction]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Primorsky Krai|districts]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Ref130&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Law #161-KZ&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], Fokino Town Under Krai Jurisdiction is incorporated as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fokino Urban Okrug&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Ref462&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Decision #384&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Tourism==
It is a closed town because the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Russian Pacific Fleet]] is based there. Foreigners must have a special permit to visit the town. However, the Islands of [[Putyatin Island|Putyatin]] and [[Askold Island|Askold]], which are a part of the territory administered by the town, are open for visits by tourists. Up to two thousand tourists visit Putyatin every year. They are attracted by the unique flora and fauna in the waters surrounding this island and its underwater landscape. Approximately 2,400&amp;amp;nbsp;people inhabit Putyatin Island. Their main occupation is catching and processing sea products, breeding [[mink]] and [[chital|spotted deer]].

There is no permanent population on Askold. It is rarely visited by tourists because of the absence of regular transport connections with the mainland, and the status of the island which until 1995 had formed part of the Reserve where no economic activity was allowed. There are deposits of [[gold]] estimated at dozens of [[tonne]]s on Askold.
