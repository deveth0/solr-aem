        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ford&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in the [[parish]] of [[Dinton-with-Ford and Upton]], in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].  It is located in the south eastern corner of the main parish.

The place name is [[Old English language|Anglo Saxon]] in origin and refers simply to the place where a stream crosses the main road via a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]].

The 16th Century pub in Ford is named after The Dinton Hermit.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.dintonhermit.co.uk The Dinton Hermit Inn]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  As well as being an old coaching inn on the main route between Aylesbury and Thame, it is also a building of historical significance.  The barn, now converted into hotel bedrooms, is built mostly of &amp;apos;witchert&amp;apos; - a local material. Starting from a base made of several layers of local stone to prevent damp, a mixture of local clay, which contains limestone, and straw and water is applied in layers and allowed to set hard before the next layer is built.

Every Wednesday and Friday morning at 10:30 a bus runs from the Dinton Hermit crossroads into Aylesbury, returning at approximately 13:30.
