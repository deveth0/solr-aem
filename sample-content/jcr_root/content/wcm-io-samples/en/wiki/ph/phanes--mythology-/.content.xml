&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Phanes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-grc|Φάνης}}, from {{lang|grc|φαίνω}}, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;phainō&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;I bring to light&amp;quot;), or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Protogonos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-el|Πρωτογόνος}}, &amp;quot;First-born&amp;quot;), was the mystic primeval [[deity]] of procreation and the generation of new life, who was introduced into [[Greek mythology]] by the [[Orphics|Orphic tradition]]; other names for this [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] Orphic concept included [[Ericapaeus]] ({{lang|grc|Ἠρικαπαῖος or Ἠρικεπαῖος}} &amp;quot;power&amp;quot;{{fact|date=July 2009}}) and [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] (&amp;quot;thought&amp;quot;). In these myths Phanes is often equated with [[Eros (god)|Eros]] and [[Mithras]] and has been depicted as a deity emerging from a [[cosmic egg]], entwined with a [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]. He had a helmet and had broad, golden wings.

Many threads of earlier myths are apparent in the new tradition. Phanes was believed to have been hatched from the [[World-Egg]] of [[Chronos]] (Time) and [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]] (Necessity). His older wife [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] (Night) called him Protogenus. As she created nighttime, he created daytime. He also created the method of creation by mingling. He was made the ruler of the deities and passed the [[sceptre]] to Nyx. This new Orphic tradition states that Nyx later gave the sceptre to her son [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranos]] before it passed to [[Cronus]] and then to Zeus, who retained it.

It is also believed that by his centuries-old battle with Chaos, the creation of birds took place as the result.

The &amp;quot;Protogonos Theogony&amp;quot; is known through the commentary in the [[Derveni papyrus]] and references in [[Empedocles]] and [[Pindar]].
