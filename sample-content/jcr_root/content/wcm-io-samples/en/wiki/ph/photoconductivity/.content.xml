&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Photoconductivity&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[optical phenomenon|optical]] and [[electrical phenomenon]] in which a material becomes more  [[electric conductance|electrically conductive]] due to the absorption of [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as [[Visible spectrum|visible light]], [[ultraviolet]] light, [[infrared]] light, or [[gamma rays|gamma radiation]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;radioconductivity&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal |first=L. A. |last=DeWerd |coauthors=P. R. Moran |pmid=634229 |title=Solid-state electrophotography with Al&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; |journal=Medical Physics |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=23–26 |year=1978|bibcode = 1978MedPh...5...23D | doi=10.1118/1.594505 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

When light is absorbed by a material such as a [[semiconductor]], the number of free electrons and [[electron hole]]s increases and raises its electrical conductivity.  To cause excitation, the light that strikes the semiconductor must have enough energy to raise electrons across the [[band gap]], or to excite the impurities within the band gap.  When a [[Biasing|bias]] [[voltage]] and a load [[resistor]] are used in series with the semiconductor, a voltage drop across the load resistors can be measured when the change in electrical conductivity of the material varies the current flowing through the circuit.

Classic examples of photoconductive materials include the [[conductive polymer]] poly[[N-Vinylcarbazole|vinylcarbazole]],&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;OrganicPhotoconductors&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cr00017a020 |url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr00017a020 |first=Kock Yee |last=Law |title=Organic photoconductive materials: recent trends and developments |journal=Chemical Reviews, American Chemical Society |volume=93 |pages=449–486 |year=1993}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; used extensively in [[photocopy]]ing ([[xerography]]);  [[Lead(II) sulfide|lead sulfide]], used in infrared detection applications, such as the U.S. [[Sidewinder missile|Sidewinder]] and Russian [[Vympel K-13|Atoll]] [[Infrared homing|heat-seeking]] [[missile]]s; and [[selenium]], employed in early television and [[xerography]].

==Applications==
{{further|Photoresistor}}
When a photoconductive material is connected as part of a circuit, it functions as a [[resistor]] whose [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] depends on the [[light intensity]]. In this context the material is called a [[photoresistor]] (also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;light-dependent resistor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;photoconductor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). The most common application of photoresistors is as [[photodetector]]s, i.e. devices that measure light intensity. Photoresistors are not the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;only&amp;apos;&amp;apos; type of photodetector—other types include [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]], [[photodiode]]s and [[phototransistor]]s—but they are among the most common photodetectors. Some photodetector applications in which photoresistors are often used include camera light meters, street lights, clock radios, and [[infrared detector]]s.
