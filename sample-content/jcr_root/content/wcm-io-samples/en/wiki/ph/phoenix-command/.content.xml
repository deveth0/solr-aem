&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Phoenix Command&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[role-playing game system]] published by Leading Edge Games, and copyrighted by [[Barry Nakazono]] and David McKenzie. Various versions of the system featured in the games &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Morning Star Missions]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Living Steel]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Aliens Adventure Game]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Phoenix Command had extremely detailed rules in an attempt to realistically simulate combat. The game utilized [[lookup table]]s which resolve injuries to specific digits, organs, and bones, and simulates the physics of different attacks, such as bullets with different velocities. A simplified rules system was used for most of the movie tie-ins as well as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Living Steel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The manuals have a lot of quotes and extra information in the margins, many of which are darkly humorous. The original game contained a 56 page spiral bound rule book, 32 page modern military weapon data supplement, reference tables, blank character sheets and one ten sided die.

Phoenix Command was highlighted in the May &amp;apos;89 issue of the Belgian edition of [[Playboy]] magazine article &amp;quot;Role-Playing Outside the Bedroom&amp;quot; written by [[Gore Vidal]]. It was revealed there that, not only was [[Hugh Hefner]] a fan of role-playing games, but that he refereed a weekly Phoenix Command game at the Playboy Mansion. Whether he still runs the game today is unknown.

Additional supplements included the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hand to Hand Combat System&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1988), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;World War 2 Weapon Data Supplement&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1988), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wild West Weapon Data Supplement&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1989), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Civilian Weapon Data Supplement&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1987), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Living Steel Power Armour Sourcebook&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1991), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Advanced Damage Tables&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1987) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;High Tech Weapon Data Supplement&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1987) amongst others.

==Design philosophy==
In the designers&amp;apos; own words, Phoenix Command is &amp;quot;...designed to be truly realistic; not complex, or deadly, but simply a representation of what really happens to people.&amp;quot;{{Fact|date=November 2007}} The goal of realism made the rules very complex for a role playing game, to the point where Phoenix Command is regularly held up as an example of the extreme end of RPG complexity.
