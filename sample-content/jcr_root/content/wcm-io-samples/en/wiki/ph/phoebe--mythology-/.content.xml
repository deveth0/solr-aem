{{Greek myth (Titan)}}

In [[Greek mythology]] &amp;quot;radiant, bright, prophetic&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Phoebe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|b|iː}}; [[Greek language|Greek]]: Φοίβη &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Phoibe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), was one of the original [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], who were one set of sons and daughters of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Hesiod]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Theogony]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; She was traditionally associated with the moon (see [[Selene]]), as in [[Michael Drayton]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Endimion and Phœbe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (1595), the first extended treatment of the [[Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]] myth in English. Her consort was her brother [[Coeus]], with whom she had two daughters, [[Leto]], who bore [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]] and [[Artemis]], and [[Asteria]], a star-goddess who bore an only daughter [[Hecate]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Hesiod. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theogony&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 404ff.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Through Leto she was the grandmother of [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]] and [[Artemis]]. The names &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Phoebe&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Phoebus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (masculine) came to be applied as synonyms for Artemis and Apollo respectively (as well as for [[Selene]] and [[Helios]]).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Compare the relation of the comparatively obscure archaic figure of [[Pallas (son of Crius)|Pallas]] and [[Athena|Pallas Athena]].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

According to a speech that [[Aeschylus]], in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Aeschylus#The Eumenides|Eumenides]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, puts in the mouth of the Delphic priestess herself, she received control of the [[Delphic Sibyl|Oracle at Delphi]] from [[Themis]]: &amp;quot;Phoebe in this succession seems to be his private invention,&amp;quot; D.S. Robertson noted, reasoning that in the three great allotments of oracular powers at Delphi, corresponding to the three generations of the gods, &amp;quot;Ouranos, as was fitting, gave the oracle to his wife Gaia and Kronos appropriately allotted it to his sister Themis.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;D. S. Robertson, &amp;quot;The Delphian Succession in the Opening of the Eumenides&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Classical Review&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;55&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.2 (September 1941, pp. 69-70) p. 69.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In Zeus&amp;apos; turn to make the gift, Aeschylus could not report that the oracle was given directly to Apollo, who had not yet been born, Robertson notes, and thus Phoebe was interposed. These supposed male delegations of the powers at Delphi as expressed by Aeschylus are not borne out by the usual modern reconstruction of the sacred site&amp;apos;s pre-Olympian history.
