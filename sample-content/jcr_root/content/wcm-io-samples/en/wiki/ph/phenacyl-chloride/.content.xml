&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Phenacyl chloride&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a substituted [[acetophenone]]. It is a useful building block in [[organic chemistry]]. Apart from that, it has been historically used as a [[riot control agent]], where it is designated &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;CN&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Preparation==
Phenacyl chloride is readily available commercially. It may be synthesized by the [[Friedel-Crafts acylation]] of [[benzene]] using [[chloroacetyl chloride]], with an [[aluminium chloride]] catalyst:&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{OrgSynth | title = ω-Chloroisonitrosoacetophenone | author = Levin, N.; Hartung, W. H. | collvol = 3 | collvolpages = 191 | year = 1955 | prep = cv3p0191}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Riot control agent==
It was investigated, but not used, during the [[World War I|First]] and [[Second World War]]s.

Because of its significantly greater toxicity,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;xl&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ballantyne | first1 = B. | last2 = Swanston | first2 = D. W. | doi = 10.1007/BF01891962 | title = The comparative acute mammalian toxicity of 1-chloroacetophenone (CN) and 2-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS) | journal = Archives of Toxicology | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 75–95 | year = 1978 | pmid =  350195| pmc = }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; it has largely been supplanted by [[CS gas]]. Even though CN is still supplied to [[paramilitary]] and police forces in a small pressurized aerosol known as “[[Mace (spray)|Mace]]” or [[tear gas]], its use is falling as [[pepper spray]] both works and disperses more quickly than CN.

The term &amp;quot;Mace&amp;quot; came into being because it was the brand-name invented by one of the first American manufacturers of CN aerosol sprays. Subsequently, Mace became [[synonymous]] with tear-gas sprays in the same way that [[Kleenex]] has become strongly associated with [[tissue paper]]s (a phenomenon known as a [[genericized trademark]]).{{fact|date=July 2012}}

Like CS gas, this compound irritates the [[mucous membrane]]s (oral, nasal, [[conjunctiva]]l and [[tracheobronchial]]). Sometimes it can give rise to more generalized reactions such as [[fainting|syncope]], temporary loss of balance and orientation.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;xl&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; More rarely, cutaneous irritating outbreaks have been observed and allergic contact permanent [[dermatitis]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite doi|10.1046/j.1365-2133.1999.02724.x}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

At high concentrations CN has caused [[corneal epithelium|corneal epithelial]] damage and [[chemosis]]. It has also accounted for at least five deaths, which have resulted from [[pulmonary injury]] and/or [[asphyxia]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{ cite journal | last = Blain | first = P.
