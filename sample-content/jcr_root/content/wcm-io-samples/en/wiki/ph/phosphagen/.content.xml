The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;phosphagens&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are energy storage compounds, also known as [[high-energy phosphate]] compounds, are chiefly found in [[muscle|muscular]] tissue in [[animal]]s.  They allow a high-energy phosphate pool to be maintained in a concentration range, which, if it all were [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], would create problems due to the [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] consuming reactions in these tissues. As muscle tissues can have sudden demands for lots of energy; these compounds can maintain a reserve of high-energy phosphates that can be used as needed, to provide the energy that could not be immediately supplied by [[glycolysis]] or [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. Phosphagens supply immediate but limited energy.

The actual [[biomolecule]] used as a phosphagen is dependent on the organism. The majority of animals use arginine/phosphoarginine as phosphagens; however, the phylum [[Chordata]] (i.e., animals with spinal cords) use [[creatine]]. [[Creatine phosphate]], or [[Creatine phosphate|phosphocreatine]], is made from ATP by the enzyme [[creatine kinase]] in a reversible reaction:

* Creatine + ATP &amp;lt;math&amp;gt;\leftrightarrow&amp;lt;/math&amp;gt; creatine phosphate + ADP  (this reaction is Mg&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;++&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-dependent)

However, [[annelids]] (segmented worms) use a set of unique phosphagens; for example, earthworms use the compound [[lombricine]].
