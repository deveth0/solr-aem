        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pherecydes of Leros&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|s|ɨ|ˌ|d|iː|z}}; {{lang-el|Φερεκύδης}}; {{circa}} 450s BC&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;G. Huxley, in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;14&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1973:137–43) places his career in the lifetime of [[Cimon]] son of [[Miltiades the Younger]].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) was a [[Greek mythology|Greek mythographer]] and [[logographer (history)|logographer]]. He came from the island of [[Leros]]. Pherecydes spent the greater part of his working life in [[Athens]], and so he was also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pherecydes of Athens&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: the encyclopedic Byzantine &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Suda]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; consider Pherecydes of Athens and of Leros separately.

Pherecydes of Leros should not be confused with [[Pherecydes of Syros]], the mid-6th-century [[philosopher]], who was one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]] and was reputed to have been the teacher of [[Pythagoras]].

== Works ==
Pherecydes&amp;apos;s great treatises (a history of his native isle, [[Leros]]; an essay, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;On [[Iphigeneia]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;On the Festivals of [[Dionysus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) are all lost. However, numerous fragments of his ten-book [[genealogy|genealogies]] of the [[god]]s and [[hero]]es, which was written in the [[Ionic dialect|Ionian]] dialect to glorify the ancestors in the heroic age of his 5th-century patrons, have been preserved. Pherecydes modified the [[legend]]s, not in order to rationalize them, but rather to adjust them to popular [[belief]]s. Therefore, Pherecydes cannot be classed with the earlier mythographer [[Hecataeus of Miletus]], whose &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Genealogiai&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Genealogies&amp;quot;) were more skeptical and critical.

Pherecydes was the main source for the mythological encyclopedia, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheke]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; mistakenly connected with the name of Apollodorus.
