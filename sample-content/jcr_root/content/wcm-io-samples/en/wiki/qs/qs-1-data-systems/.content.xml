        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;QS/1&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a division of the [[J M Smith Corporation]], a company founded in 1944 with revenue of over $US 2 billion and based in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]].

In 1977, the company recognized health care professionals&amp;apos; need for software and hardware packages designed to help provide more efficient and effective care for customers and [[pharmacy]] patients. QS/1&amp;apos;s first system was the QS/1 Pharmacy System, known as RxCare Plus, and was designed for the independent pharmacy market. QS/1&amp;apos;s latest system, known as NRx, has added a more &amp;quot;Windows-like&amp;quot; [[GUI]] interface to the RxCare Plus system, continuing to develop easier methods of processing prescriptions.

Today, QS/1 provides products, services, and support to a variety of health care providers with a primary focus on providing the industry&amp;apos;s best software for managing independent retail, long-term care and outpatient pharmacies, as well as Home Medical Equipment (HME) and Durable Medical Equipment (DME) providers. Their employees develop software and train and support their customers through their broad network of [[North American]] field offices.

Also, QS/1 Government Solutions group provides software and services for state and local governments, law enforcement departments, judicial offices, municipal utilities, and other offices.

QS/1 Data Systems is also home to PowerLine, which provides insurance claim switching services through redundant data centers and networks for transmission to insurance companies. These redundant networks and data centers support prescription, electronic prescription and credit card transmissions. All traffic to these networks are encrypted between the pharmacy and the insurance company and supports the [[HIPAA]] privacy regulations.
