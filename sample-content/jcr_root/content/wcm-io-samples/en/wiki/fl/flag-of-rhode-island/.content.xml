==History==
[[File:Flag of Rhode Island 1882-1897.svg|thumb|left|200px|Flag of Rhode Island 1882-1897]]
The flag of the state of Rhode Island as it presently exists was formally adopted in 1897. As early as the 1640s, the anchor and &amp;quot;hope&amp;quot; were found on the [[Rhode Island Seal]], and the seal&amp;apos;s words and emblems were likely inspired by the biblical phrase &amp;quot;hope we have as an anchor of the soul,&amp;quot; found in [[Hebrews (Bible)|Hebrews]], Verse 6:18-19.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Howard M. Chapin notes published in &amp;quot;Illustrations Of The Seals, Arms And Flags Of Rhode Island,&amp;quot; ([[Rhode Island Historical Society]], Providence: 1930) pg 4-5.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Rhode Island&amp;apos;s earliest colonists were fleeing religious persecution in Massachusetts due to their Christian beliefs.
