The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[flag]] of [[Turkmenistan]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Флаг Туркмении}}; {{lang-tk|Türkmenistanyň baýdagy}}) was adopted on January 24, 2001.

It features a green field with a vertical red stripe near the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag areas|hoist]] side, containing five [[carpet]] [[Gul (design)|gul]]s (designs used in producing rugs) stacked above two crossed [[olive]] branches similar to those on the flag of the [[United Nations]]; a white waxing [[Hilal (crescent moon)|crescent moon]], typical of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ve [[Islamic]] symbology, and five white [[five-pointed star]]s appear in the upper corner of the field just to the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag areas|fly]] side of the red stripe.

The green and red colors appear in this flag because they have been venerated historically by the Turkmen. The waxing crescent moon symbolizes the hope of the country for a shining future and the stars represent the five [[province]]s (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Provinces of Turkmenistan|welayatlar]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) of Turkmenistan &amp;amp;ndash; [[Ahal Province|Ahal]], [[Balkan Province|Balkan]], [[Daşoguz Province|Dashhowuz]], [[Lebap Province|Lebap]], and [[Mary Province|Mary]].

The five traditional carpet designs along the hoist represent the five major [[tribe]]s or houses, and form motifs in the country&amp;apos;s state emblem and flag. These Turkmen tribes in traditional order (as well as top to bottom) are [[Teke tribe|Teke]] (Tekke), [[Yomut carpet|Yomut]] ([[Yomud]]), [[Saryk]] ([[Saryq]]), [[Chowdur]] ([[Choudur]]), and [[Arsary]] ([[Ersary]]).  The middle design may also represent the [[Salyr]] ([[Salor]]), a tribe that declined as a result of military defeat before the modern period.

The wreath is one of the odder parts of the flag, added against the rules of [[heraldry]] and breaking up the carpet pattern. It was added as an afterthought to represent the &amp;quot;status of [[Neutrality Arch|permanent neutrality]],&amp;quot; which was accepted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 12, 1995.

Before [[independence]] from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, Turkmenistan had a flag similar to all other Soviet Republics; see [[Flag of the Turkmen SSR]]. After independence in 1991, Turkmenistan adopted a flag very similar to the current design, on February 19, 1992. However, the designs on the left were different. In 1997, an olive branch was added to symbolize the peace-loving nature of the Turkmen people. This version is now the current version.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://flagspot.net/flags/tm.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
