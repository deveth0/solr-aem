        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Flibbertigibbet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Middle English]] word referring to a flighty or whimsical person, usually a young woman.  In modern use, it is used as a slang term, especially in [[Yorkshire]], for a [[gossip]]y or overly talkative person.  Its origin is in a meaningless representation of chattering.  &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-fli1.htm World Wide Words]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

This word also has a historical use as a name for a fiend, devil or spirit. In [[Shakespeare]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[King Lear]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (IV, i (1605)), he is one of the five [[fiend]]s Edgar (in the posture of a beggar, [[Tom o&amp;apos; Bedlam]]) claimed was possessing him.  Shakespeare got the name from [[Samuel Harsnett]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1603),{{fact|date=May 2009}} where one reads of 40 fiends, which [[Jesuits]] cast out and among which was Fliberdigibbet, described as one of &amp;quot;foure deuils of the round, or Morrice, whom &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sara&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in her fits, tuned together, in measure and sweet cadence.&amp;quot;

By extension it has also been used as a synonym for [[Puck (mythology)|Puck]]. Through its use as a nickname for a character in [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Kenilworth (novel)|Kenilworth]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, it has gained the meaning of an impish child.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Flibbertigibbet similarly features as a name in a local legend around [[Wayland&amp;apos;s Smithy]]. According to the tale, Flibbertigibbet was apprentice to [[Wayland the Smith]], and greatly exasperated his master.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.waylands.net/public/smithy/legends.htm Wayland the Smith]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Eventually Wayland threw Flibbertigibbet down the hill and into a valley, where he was transformed into a stone. Scott associates his Flibbertigibbet character in Kenilworth with Wayland Smith.{{fact|date=May 2009}}

Another historical connection and likely origin of the word comes from &amp;quot;fly by the gibbet&amp;quot;.  A [[gibbet]] can refer to a platform or cage used to execute criminals and display their remains outside a town to warn other would-be criminals.  The remains over time would be picked apart by small creatures and birds and thus &amp;apos;fly away&amp;apos;.  &amp;quot;Fly by the Gibbet&amp;quot; may also have been used as a sailing expression to refer to hoisting the gibbet sail.  This is a large sail that can be used when sailing with the direction of the wind to capture as much wind as possible. A sail that has not been pulled tight will flap in the wind, which may have also contributed to the association.
