The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[flag]] of [[Burkina Faso]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is formed by two equal horizontal bands of [[red]] (top) and [[green]], with a [[yellow]] five-pointed [[star]] resting in the center.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web

&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The flag was adopted on 4 August 1984.  The flag is coloured in the popular [[Pan-African colours]] of the [[flag of Ethiopia|Ethiopian flag]], reflecting both a break with the countryâ€™s colonial past and its unity with other African ex-colonies. The red is also said to symbolize the revolution and the green the abundance of agricultural and natural riches. The yellow star placed over the red and green stripes is the guiding light of the revolution.  The flag was adopted following the coup of 1983 which brought [[Thomas Sankara]] to power.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;WS&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book

==National coat of arms==
The current coat of arms of Burkina Faso feature a shield with the national flag colors, with a scroll bearing the name &amp;quot;BURKINA FASO&amp;quot; accompanied by two stallions on each side, with an open book at the bottom. A lower banner bears the national motto in French: &amp;quot;Unity - Progress - Justice&amp;quot;.

==Prior national flags and coat of arms==
The original flag of [[Burkina Faso#Upper Volta|Upper Volta]], adopted at independence, contained three horizontal stripes of black, white, and red. These colours represented the three major tributaries of the [[Volta River]], which flows south through the country: the [[Black Volta]], the [[White Volta]] and the [[Red Volta]].  It is similar to the old [[Flag_of_Germany#North_German_Confederation_and_the_German_Empire|Imperial German flag]].

{{main|Coat of arms of Burkina Faso}}
From 1984 until 1997, the official Burkina Faso coat of arms used a revolutionary central crest featuring a [[scythe]] crossed with a Soviet [[AK-47]] assault rifle, along with an open book symbolising the importance of education and the study of revolutionary principles.  A lower banner declared in French, &amp;quot;Motherland or Death, We Shall Overcome&amp;quot;.
