The State flag of the Republic of Uzbekistan was approved at the Eighth Extraordinary Session of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Uzbekistan, on November 18, 1991.

The State flag and its symbols portray the historical links with states which have existed in the past within the borders of modern Uzbekistan and embodies in itself the [[Culture of Uzbekistan|national and cultural traditions]] of the republic.

# The color blue on the flag is a symbol of the eternal sky and life-giving water, which reflect the essence of life. In symbolic language it represents goodness, wisdom, honesty, glory and loyalty. Consequently, the color of [[Amir Temur]]’s state flag was also blue.
# The color white on the flag, symbolizing [[holy]] peace, harmonizes with the illumination of the day and the sources of light in the universe. The color white is a symbol of purity, transparency, innocence, the cleanliness of desires and dreams, and a striving for inner beauty.
# The color green is a symbol of the renewal of nature. In quite a few nations, it is considered to be a symbol of youth, hope and joy.
# The red stripes are tributaries of the power of life that flows in our bodies.
# The depiction of a youthful [[crescent moon]] is connected with [[Uzbek]] historical traditions. At the same time it is a symbol of [[History of Uzbekistan|the independence]] obtained by Uzbekistan.
# Stars are considered a spiritual, divine symbol for all nations. The 12 stars depicted on the state flag of the Republic of Uzbekistan are also directly connected with [[Uzbek]] historical traditions, with the ancient calendar-cycle of the sun. The symbol of the 12 stars is also related to the development of astronomy in the scientific thought of the ancient states within the borders of Uzbekistan. The depiction of 12 stars on the Uzbek state flag can be understood as a symbol of the antiquity of the culture of the Uzbek people, its maturity and the striving for happiness in its land.
