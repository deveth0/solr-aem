        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Flushing Meadows&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[1965 in film|1965]]) is an American short film by [[Larry Jordan]], with director [[Joseph Cornell]]. The film is 8 minutes long, in color, [[16mm film|16mm]], and [[silent film|silent]].

The film is an ode to the memory of [[Joyce Hunter]], a Queens [[waitress]] Cornell met in 1962.  Cornell apparently had an infatuation with Hunter even though she was found to have stolen items and attempted to fence them.  Cornell never pressed charges against Hunter and she was murdered in December 1964.

The film was produced after Hunter&amp;apos;s death and is largely a series of scenes from [[Flushing Cemetery]] where Hunter was buried.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/21/nyregion/neighborhood-report-flushing-poet-enigmatic-film-ode-vanished-love.html?ref=josephcornell New York Times (December 21, 2003)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The film was first shown publicly at the [[Gramercy Theatre]] in [[New York]] on December 22, 2003. The short aired twice at the [[2004 Toronto International Film Festival]], in commemoration of the centennial of Cornell&amp;apos;s birth.
