The national &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[flag]] of [[Cameroon]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was adopted in its present form on 20 May 1975 after Cameroon became a unitary state. It is a vertical tricolor of green, red and yellow, defaced with a five-pointed star in its center. There is a wide variation in the size of the central star, although it is always contained within the inside stripe.

The color scheme uses the traditional [[Pan-African colors]] (Cameroon becoming the second state to do so), and the [[tricolor flag|tricolor]] design is adapted from the [[flag of France]]. The center stripe is thought to stand for unity: [[red]] is the colour of unity, and the star is referred to as &amp;quot;the star of unity&amp;quot;.  The [[yellow]] stands for the sun, and also the [[savanna]]s in the northern part of the country, while the [[green]] is for the [[forest]]s in the southern part of Cameroon.

The previous flag of Cameroon (1961-1975) had a similar color scheme, but with two gold (darker than the third stripe by comparison) stars in the upper half of the green. It was adopted following British South Cameroon&amp;apos;s joining of the State of Cameroon.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; The International Flag Book in Color, Christian Fogd Pedersen, (1971)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The original flag, first made law by Law 46 of 26 October 1957, was the simple tricolor. It was confirmed  on 21 February 1960 in the new constitution.
