The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[flag]] of [[Ivory Coast]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-fr|Drapeau de la C么te d&amp;apos;Ivoire}}) features three equal vertical bands of orange ([[Hoist (flag)|hoist]] side), white, and green.

After independence, the Ivory Coast formed a loose alliance of [[West Africa]]n states. The flags of these states were influenced both by the [[Pan-African colours]] first used by [[Ghana]], and also by the model of the [[Flag of France|French Tricolour]], the flag of the former colonial power. The colours chosen for the Ivory Coast&amp;apos;s flag were also used by [[Flag of Niger|Niger]], with which the Ivory Coast had an alliance. They were intended to symbolise the following:  the [[Orange (colour)|orange colour]] stands for the land, the [[savannah]] found in the northern part and its [[fertility]], the [[white]] represents [[peace]], and the [[green]] represents [[hope]] and also the [[forest]] of the southern part of the country.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://flagspot.net/flags/ci.html Flags of the World - Cote d&amp;apos;Ivoire]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The flag was adopted in 1959, just prior to independence.

==Similar flags==

The flag is similar to the [[flag of Ireland]], but the latter is longer and has the colours reversed: the green is at the hoist side. It has also similar colours to those of [[flag of India|India]] and [[flag of Niger|Niger]].
