For a person to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;flush&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is to become markedly [[red]] in the [[face]] and often other areas of the skin, from various [[physiology|physiological]] conditions. Flushing is generally distinguished, despite a close physiological relation between them, from [[blushing]], which is milder, generally restricted to the face, cheeks or ears, and generally assumed to reflect embarrassment. Flushing is also a cardinal symptom of [[carcinoid syndrome]]—the syndrome that results from [[hormone]]s (often [[serotonin]] or [[histamine]]) being secreted into systemic circulation.

==Causes of flushing==
* [[Fever]]
* [[Alcohol flush reaction]]
* An abrupt cessation of physical [[Exercise|exertion]] (resulting in [[heart]] output in excess of current [[muscle|muscular]] need for blood flow)
* Emotions: [[anger]], [[embarrassment]] (for this reason it is also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;erythema pudoris&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, from the Latinized Greek word for &amp;quot;redness&amp;quot; and the Latin &amp;quot;of [[embarrassment]]&amp;quot;)
* [[Sexual arousal]], especially [[orgasm]], (see section to follow)
* [[Inflammation]] (for example, caused by [[allergy|allergic reaction]] or [[infection]])
* High doses of non flush free [[niacin]] (vitamin B&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;)
* [[Caffeine]] consumption
* [[Sexual intercourse]] (see below)
* Some recreational drugs, such as [[alcohol]], [[heroin]], [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamines]]
* [[Carcinoid]] tumor
* [[Mastocytosis]]
* [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], especially [[emphysema]] (also known as &amp;quot;pink puffer&amp;quot;)
* Mixing an [[antibiotic]] with [[alcohol]]
* [[Rosacea]]
* [[Histamines]]
* Spicy foods
* Powerful [[vasodilator]]s, such as dihydropyridine [[calcium channel blockers]]
* [[Herxheimer reaction]] (caused by antibiotics)
* [[Iron poisoning]]{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}
* [[Reactive hypoglycemia]]
* [[Atropine]] poisoning
* [[keratosis pilaris rubra faceii]]
* [[Carbon monoxide poisoning]]
* [[Antiestrogen]]s such as [[Tamoxifen]]
* Hyperstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, especially the [[vagus nerve]]
* [[ACNES]] Abdominal Cutaneous Nerve Entrapment Syndrome, usually in patients who have had abdominal surgery
* Compression of the nerve by the sixth [[thoracic vertebrae]]
* [[Butorphanol]] reaction with some narcotic analgesics (since [[butorphanol]] is also an antagonist)
* Sunburn ([[erythema]])
* Polycythemia Vera
* [[Vinpocetine]]
* Body contact with warm or hot water (hot tub, bath, shower)
* [[Dehydration]]

==Sex flush==
Commonly referred to as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;sex flush&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, vasocongestion (increased [[blood]] flow) of the [[skin]] can occur during all four phases of the [[human sexual response cycle]]. Studies show that the sex flush occurs in approximately 50–75% of [[female]]s and 25% of [[male]]s, yet not consistently. The sex flush tends to occur more often under warmer conditions and may not appear at all under cooler [[temperature]]s.

During the [[female]] sex flush, [[pink]]ish spots develop under the [[breast]]s, then spread to the [[breast]]s, [[torso]], [[face]], [[hands]], [[Sole (foot)|soles]] of the [[foot|feet]], and possibly over the entire [[body]]. [[Vasocongestion]] is also responsible for the darkening of the [[clitoris]] and the walls of the [[vagina]] during [[sexual arousal]]. During the [[male]] sex flush, the [[color]]ation of the skin develops less consistently than in the female, but typically starts with the epigastrium (upper [[abdomen]]), spreads across the [[chest]], then continues to the [[neck]], [[face]], [[forehead]], [[back]], and sometimes, [[shoulder]]s and [[forearm]]s.

The sex flush typically disappears soon after [[orgasm]] occurs, but this may take up to two hours or so, and sometimes intense [[sweat]]ing will occur simultaneously.
