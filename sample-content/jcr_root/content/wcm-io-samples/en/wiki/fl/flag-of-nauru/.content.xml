Following the [[declaration of independence|indepencence]] of [[Nauru]], the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;flag of Nauru&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was raised for the first time.
The flag, chosen in a local design competition, was adopted on independence day, 31 January 1968. It depicts Nauru&amp;apos;s geographical position, one degree below the [[Equator]]. A gold horizontal stripe representing the Equator runs across a blue field for the Pacific Ocean. Nauru itself is symbolized by a white 12-pointed star. Each point represents one of the 12 indigenous tribes on the island.

==Proportions and symbolism==
The flag displays the geographical location of the [[island nation]].

The narrow yellow stripe with a width of &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;24&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; of the length of the flag represents the [[Equator]].

The twelve-pointed white star signifies the location of the island in the blue waters of the [[Pacific Ocean]] just south of the Equator.  The separation of the blue flag cloth into two equal parts recalls the [[saga]], that the first inhabitants were to have been brought to Earth from two boulders.

The twelve points on the star represent the island&amp;apos;s twelve original tribes.

The white represents the [[phosphate]], through which the island&amp;apos;s residents acquired wealth from mining.

==Creation and adoption==
The flag was created by a resident employed by the [[Australia]]n flag manufacturer Evans. It was officially adopted on 31 January 1968. Unlike some flags of [[Pacific]] nations (e.g., that of [[Flag of Tuvalu|Tuvalu]]), [[Nauru]]&amp;apos;s flag has evoked little controversy.

==Flag variant used by Scouts==

A variant of the Flag of [[Nauru]] is used by [[Scouts]] locally.
