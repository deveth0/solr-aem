The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;flag of [[Laos]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was adopted on December 2, 1975. The flag had previously been used by the short-lived [[Lao Issara]] government of 1945-46, then by the [[Pathet Lao]].

==Description and symbolism==
The flag consists of three horizontal strips, middle blue strip is twice the height of the top and bottom red stripes. In the middle is a white disc, the diameter of the disc is 0.8 times the height of the blue stripe. The flag ratio is 2:3.
The national flag of Laos was adopted in 1975, when the country became a people&amp;apos;s republic. It is one of the few Communist flags that does not use the five-pointed star as an emblem. This flag replaced the original flag of Laos, which was red, with a triple-headed white elephant on a pedestal beneath a parasol. This expressed the ancientrnment coalition, before assuming power directly and prompting the abdication of the king. Their flag was adopted as the national flag. In the center is a whinisad name of the country, &amp;quot;Land of a Million Elephants,&amp;quot; and dated from the 19th century. From 1953 onward the royal government waged war with the Pathet Lao, whose flag was blue with a white disk and red borders at the top and bottom. From 1973-1975, the Pathet Lao formed part of the disk symbolizing the unity of the people under the leadership of the [[Lao People&amp;apos;s Revolutionary Party]] and the country&amp;apos;s bright future. It is also said to represent a full moon against the Mekong River.

==History==

From 1952 until the fall of the royal government in 1975 the country had a red flag, with a white three-headed elephant (the god [[Airavata|Erawan]]) in the middle. On top of the elephant is a nine-folded umbrella, while the elephant itself stands on a five-level pedestal. The [[White elephant (pachyderm)|white elephant]] is a common royal symbol in [[Southeast Asia]], the three heads referred to the three former kingdoms [[Vientiane Province|Vientiane]], [[Kingdom of Laos|Luangprabang]], and [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]] which made up the country. The nine-folded umbrella is also a royal symbol, originating from [[Sumeru|Mount Meru]] in the [[Buddhist cosmology]]. The pedestal represented the law on which the country rested.

The Western [[heraldry|heraldic]] [[blazon]] is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;a banner Gules, a [[Spanish fess]] azure charged with a [[roundel|plate]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This new flag has replaced the one used since 1952.
