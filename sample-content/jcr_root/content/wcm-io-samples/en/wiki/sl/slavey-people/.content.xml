[[File:Slavey girls Mackenzie River Northwest Territories - NA-1463-23.jpg|300px|thumb|Slavey girls, [[Mackenzie River]], [[Northwest Territories]]]]
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Slavey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Slave&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) are a [[First Nations]] [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada|aboriginal people]] of the [[Dene]] group, [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] to the [[Great Slave Lake]] region, in [[Canada]]&amp;apos;s [[Northwest Territories]], and extending into northeastern [[British Columbia]] and northwestern [[Alberta]].

==Name==
The name &amp;quot;Slave&amp;quot; is an English translation of the [[Cree]] name for their traditional enemies, including the people now known as the Slavey, whom they often enslaved; the French &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Esclave&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is analogous. However, in order to avoid the connotations of the word [[slavery|slave]], the name came to be presented as indigenous, and this was indicated by pronouncing the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;e&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Later the spelling was changed to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Slavé&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and then &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Slavey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, to capture the new pronunciation. The name is seldom used by the Slavey, who call themselves &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dene]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Because most [[Athabaskan]] peoples call themselves &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dene&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the word is of little use in English.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} However, the northern Slavey are also known as the [[Sahtu|Sahtú]]. The southern band are known as the Deh Cho.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.dehcho.org&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The names of the [[Slave River]], [[Lesser Slave River]], [[Great Slave Lake]] and [[Lesser Slave Lake]] all derive from this Cree name for their enemies, though not necessarily from the people now known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Slavey&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in English. The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Esclaves&amp;apos;&amp;apos; remains incorporated in each of these geographical features&amp;apos; French names.

== Groups ==
The [[Sahtu]] or [[North Slavey people]] live exclusively in the [[Northwest Territories]].  They speak the [[North Slavey language]].

The South Slavey live in [[Northern Alberta|north western Alberta]], north eastern British Columbia, and the southern Northwest Territories.

The [[Dene Tha&amp;apos; First Nation]] in Alberta is a South Slavey nation.
