&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Clara Petacci&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Claretta Petacci&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-it|klaˈretta peˈtattʃi}}; 28 February 1912 – 28 April 1945) was the mistress of the Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], who was twenty-eight years her senior.

On 27 April 1945, Mussolini and Petacci were captured by [[Italian resistance movement|Communist partisans]] while traveling with a convoy of [[Italian Social Republic]] members.  On 28 April, she and Mussolini were taken to [[Mezzegra]] and shot.

The bodies were photographed as a crowd vented their rage upon them.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://cidc.library.cornell.edu/dof/italy/captioned/hanging.htm |title=Death of the Father-Mussolini &amp;amp; Fascist Italy: the &amp;apos;infamous&amp;apos; exhibit |publisher=[[Cornell Institute for Digital Collections]] |year=1999}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
