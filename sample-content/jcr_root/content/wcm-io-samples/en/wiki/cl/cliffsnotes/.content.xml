&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;CliffsNotes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (formerly &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cliffs Notes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, originally &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cliff&amp;apos;s Notes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and often, erroneously, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;CliffNotes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) are a series of [[student]] [[study guide]]s available primarily in the [[United States]]. The guides present and explain literary and other works in [[pamphlet]] form or online. Detractors of the study guides claim they let students bypass reading the assigned literature. The company claims to promote the reading of the original work, and does not view the study guides as a substitute for that reading.

CliffsNotes was started by a [[Nebraska]] native named [[Clifton Hillegass|Cliff Hillegass]] in 1958. He was working at [[Nebraska Book Co.]] of Lincoln, Nebraska, when he met Jack Cole, the co-owner of Coles, a Toronto book business.  Coles was also the publisher of a series of [[Canada|Canadian]] study guides called [[Coles Notes]]. Jack Cole offered the American rights to Hillegass.

Hillegass and his wife, Catherine, started the business in their basement at 511 Eastridge Drive in Lincoln, with sixteen [[William Shakespeare]] titles. CliffsNotes now exist on hundreds of works. The term &amp;quot;Cliff&amp;apos;s Notes&amp;quot; has now come into modern usage as a generic [[noun]] for similar products.

[[IDG Books]] purchased CliffsNotes in 1998. [[John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons]] acquired IDG Books (renamed Hungry Minds) in 2001.  In 2011, CliffsNotes announced a joint venture with AOL and reality TV show producer [[Mark Burnett]] to introduce a series of 60-second [[video study guide]] surveys of literary works.  &amp;lt;ref name=marketplace&amp;gt;{{Cite web|title=Cliff Notes Goes Digital|url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/03/10/pm-cliffsnotes-goes-digital//|accessdate=2011-03-10|publisher=American Public Radio}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 2012, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH) acquired CliffsNotes, Inc., and the brand lives on today as part of the global learning company, and its mission of changing lives by fostering passionate, curious learners.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web|title=About CliffsNotes|url=http://www.cliffsnotes.com/about-cliffsnotes | accessdate=2013-06-26|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
