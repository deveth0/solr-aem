        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;clamp&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[fastener|fastening device]] to hold or secure objects tightly together to prevent movement or separation through the application of inward [[pressure]]. In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]], the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;cramp&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is often used instead when the tool is for temporary use for positioning components during [[construction]] and [[woodworking]]; thus a [[C clamp|G cramp]] or a sash cramp but a wheel clamp or a surgical clamp.

There are many types of clamps available for many different purposes. Some are temporary, as used to position components while fixing them together, others are intended to be permanent. In the field of animal husbandry, using a clamp to attach an animal to a stationary object is known as &amp;quot;rounded clamping.&amp;quot; A physical clamp of this type is also used to refer to an obscure investment banking term; notably &amp;quot;fund clamps.&amp;quot; Anything that performs the action of clamping may be called a clamp, so this gives rise to a wide variety of terms across many fields.

Although technically not a clamp, gripping elements mounted on the buckets of [[Heavy equipment (construction)|heavy duty equipment]] are referred to as clamps too.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://dymaxinc.com/attachments/6041/ Attachments with Top Clamps]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

These clamps (or cramps) are used to position components temporarily for various tasks:
* [[Band clamp]] or web clamp
* [[Bar clamp]] [[F-clamp]] or sliding clamp (upper left in the photo)
* Bench clamp (for holding things to a bench top) The bench forms the fixed jaw.
* Cardellini clamp – jaw-style clamp that clamps onto round, square, or rectangular tubing; or onto flat objects, such as dimensional lumber or plywood sheets&amp;amp;mdash;to mount motion picture lights, or grip equipment such as gobo heads
* [[C-clamp]] (also G-clamp) (lower centre in the photo) ([http://www.technologystudent.com/equip1/cramp1.htm UK G-c&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;r&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;amp])
* [[Flooring clamp]] A carpenter&amp;apos;s clamp used to cramp up floorboards prior to fixing.
* Forked clamp stainless steel for ST [[ground glass joint]]s with/without [[setscrew]]. Sizes for: ST 14, 19, 24, 29 änd 45.
* [[Gripe (tool)|Gripe]] (a specialized clamp, tightened with a wedge, for holding [[strake#1. Boatbuilding|strakes]] in position when building a [[Clinker (boat building)|clinker]] boat)
* Handscrew (upper right in the photo)
* Kant-Twist clamp
* Magnetic clamp (see [[Magnetic base]])
* [[Mitre clamp]]
* [[Pipe clamp]] (top of photo)
* Sash clamp (a specialized, long form of the bar clamp)
* [[Set screw]]
* Speed clamp
* Toggle clamp
* Toolmakers&amp;apos; clamp (a smaller, precision version of the handscrew, all in steel)
* Pinch Dog (a small &amp;quot;staple&amp;quot; shaped device, designed to straddle a joint, and pull the joint tightly together during the glue up process)

===Permanent===
* [[Hose clamp]]
* [[Marman clamp]]
* [[Wire rope#Wire Rope Clamps .28or Wire Rope Clips.29|Wire rope clamp]]
