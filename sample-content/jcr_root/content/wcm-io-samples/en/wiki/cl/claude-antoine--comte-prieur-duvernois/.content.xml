&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Claude Antoine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[comte]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Prieur-Duvernois&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, commonly known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Prieur de la [[Côte-d&amp;apos;Or]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; after his native &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[département in France|département]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, to distinguish him from [[Pierre Louis Prieur]] (2 December 1763&amp;amp;mdash;11 August 1832), was a [[France|French]] engineer and a politician during and after the [[French Revolution]].

==Life==

===Early life and revolutionary beginnings===
Born in [[Auxonne]], [[Côte-d&amp;apos;Or]]. As an officer of engineers, he presented to the [[National Constituent Assembly]] in 1790 a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mémoire&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on the [[Systems of measurement|standardization of weights and measures]].

In 1791 he was returned by the Côte-d&amp;apos;Or to the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], and in 1792 to the [[National Convention]]. In 1792, Prieur-Duvernois was sent on a mission to the [[French Revolutionary Army|Army of the Rhine]] to announce the deposition of [[List of French monarchs|King]] [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], after having voted in favor of his [[Capital punishment|execution]].

In 1793 he was a [[Representatives on mission|representative on mission]] surveying the ports of [[Lorient]] and [[Dunkirk]], but he was arrested in [[Normandy]] upon the fall of the [[Girondist]]s (June 1793) by the rebel authorities of [[Caen]], and only released in July 1793 after the defeat of their forces at [[Vernon, Eure|Vernon]].

===Committee of Public Safety===
On 14 August 1793 he became a member of the [[Committee of Public Safety]], where he allied himself with [[Lazare Carnot]] in the organization of national defence, being especially charged with the provision of munitions for the troops engaged in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite book |last1=Rudé |first1=George |authorlink=George Rudé |title=The French Revolution |year=1988 |publisher=Grove Weidenfeld |location=New York |isbn=0-8021-3272-3 |page=97 |url= &amp;lt;!--|quote=The twelve men who composed the Committee...[included] Prieur of the Côte-d&amp;apos;Or, an engineering officer who undertook the supply of munitions.--&amp;gt;}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; With Carnot, he aligned with the [[Reign of Terror]], and voted in favor of [[Georges Danton]]&amp;apos;s execution.

Retaining his seat after the [[Thermidorian Reaction]], he managed to escape capture in the riots of [[Revolt of 1 prairial year III|Prairial Insurrection]] (20 May 1795), and was subsequently spared the attacks of moderates in the Thermidorian Convention.

===Directory and Empire===
Under the [[French Directory|Directory]] he sat in the [[Council of Five Hundred]], retiring after [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]&amp;apos;s [[18 Brumaire|18 Brumaire coup]] (9 November 1799). In 1808 he was created a [[count]] of the [[First French Empire|Empire]], and in 1811 he retired from the army with the grade of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;chef de brigade&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the equivalent of [[colonel]]).

Prieur-Duvernois was one of the founders of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[École Polytechnique]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and shared in the establishment of the [[Institut de France]]; the adoption of the [[metric system]] and the foundation of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bureau des Longitudes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were also due to his efforts. Prieur died in [[Dijon]].
