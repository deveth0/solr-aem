In [[North American English]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Club Fed&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a term that describes a [[prison]] whose accommodations are less severe than many other prisons. The term is a [[pun]] on the &amp;quot;[[Club Med]]&amp;quot; chain of [[all-inclusive resort]]s. The 1999 movie &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Office Space]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; made a reference to this style of prison by referring to it as a, &amp;quot;white-collar, minimum-security resort.&amp;quot; They also referred to the opposite of this as, &amp;quot;Federal Pound Me In The Ass Prison&amp;quot;.

==Differential treatment for white-collar offenders==
Because white-collar crimes are committed without violence, they are most likely to garner less severe criminal penalties.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Club Fed in Canada==
In [[Canada]], &amp;quot;Club Fed&amp;quot; was used derisively to describe the [[Joliette Institution For Women]], the [[Joliette]] [[prison]] where [[serial killer]] [[Karla Homolka]] was held, because of the prison&amp;apos;s supposedly luxurious conditions and lax restrictions, claims the prison has denied.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
