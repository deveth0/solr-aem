The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Clarendon Building&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a landmark [[Grade I listed]] building in [[Oxford]], England, owned by the [[University of Oxford]]. It was built between 1711 and 1715 to house the [[Oxford University Press]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ventrolla http://www.ventrolla.co.uk/news1/historic-clarendon-building-in-oxford-receives-ventrolla-window-upgrade--72 Accessed 2008-04-29&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It stands in the centre of the city in [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]], near the [[Bodleian Library]] and the [[Sheldonian Theatre]]. It was vacated by the Press in the early nineteenth century, and used by the university for administrative purposes. In 1975 it was handed over to the [[Bodleian Library]], and now provides office and meeting space for senior members of staff.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Jenkins, S. http://www.headington.org.uk/oxon/broad/buildings/south/clarendon.htm. Accessed 2007-02-10.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The building was designed by [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] ([[Christopher Wren]]&amp;apos;s greatest pupil) and built between 1711 and 1715 to house the Press&amp;apos;s printing operations.  Before the construction of the Clarendon Building, the presses were in the basement of the [[Sheldonian Theatre]], and the compositors could not work when the Theatre was in use for ceremonies.

The building was financed largely from the proceeds of the commercially successful &amp;apos;&amp;apos;History of the Great Rebellion&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]], whose money also paid for the building of the [[Clarendon Laboratory]] in [[Oxford]].

On 22 January 2009, student demonstrators occupied part of the Clarendon Building for seven hours,&amp;lt;ref name=bbc&amp;gt;{{cite news |title=Gaza sit-in demonstration ended |date=22 January 2009 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/7844890.stm |accessdate=22 January 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; following similar protests at other UK universities.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |author=Anthea Lipsett| title=Protests over Gaza spread to eight English universities |date=22 January 2009 |work=[[guardian.co.uk]] |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/jan/22/studentpolitics-londonschoolofeconomics |accessdate=22 January 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The demonstrators, who were calling for the University to condemn Israel&amp;apos;s role in the [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict]] and to cancel a lecture series at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] inaugurated by [[Shimon Peres]],&amp;lt;ref name=bbc/&amp;gt; ended their protest after an agreement with the [[Proctor#Oxford University|Senior Proctor]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |title=Statement by the Senior Proctor concerning the occupation of the Clarendon Building |date=28 January 2009 |url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/proctors/statement280109.shtml |accessdate=2008-01-29 |work=University Administration and Services |publisher=[[University of Oxford]]}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |author=[[John Hood]] |title=Letter from the Vice-Chancellor |date=28 January 2009 |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/vicechancellors_office/letter280109.html |accessdate=2008-01-29 |work=Vice-Chancellor&amp;apos;s Office |publisher=[[University of Oxford]]}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
