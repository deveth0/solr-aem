        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Classical Pantheism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a phrase that has been used in various ways. The most common use is as a term used by American philosopher [[Charles Hartshorne]] to describe theological [[deterministic]] philosophies of those he considers [[pantheists]] such as [[Baruch Spinoza]] and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].  The term has also been used to mean Pantheism in the classical Greek and Roman era,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Principles of Natural Theology, George Hayward Joyce, 2003, p482&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Anti-theistic theories: being the Baird lecture for l877, by Robert Flint p536&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; or archetypal pantheism as variously defined by different authors.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Pantheism: A Non-Theistic Concept of Deity, Michael Philip Levine, 1994, p163&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Hartshorne&amp;apos;s Classical Pantheism ==

This usage of the term Classical Pantheism was first presented by [[Charles Hartshorne]] in 1953,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, &amp;quot;Philosophers Speak of God,&amp;quot; Humanity Books, 1953 ch 4&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and by others discussing his presentation.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;David Ray John B. Cobb, Clark H. Pinnock, &amp;quot;Searching for an Adequate God: A Dialogue Between Process and Free Will Theists&amp;quot;, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000, p. 177&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  In making his case for [[panentheism]], Hartshorne sought to distinguish [[panentheism]], which rejects determinism, from deterministic pantheism.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Park, Chan Ho, &amp;quot;Transcendence And Spatiality of the Triune Creator&amp;quot;, European Academic Publishers, 2005, p. 4&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The term &amp;quot;pantheism&amp;quot; is derived from Greek words pan (πᾶν, &amp;quot;all&amp;quot;) and theos (θεός, &amp;quot;God&amp;quot;), together meaning &amp;quot;All-God&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;All is God.&amp;quot;  It is often associated with [[monism]], the idea that existence has one sort of underlying substance.

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Encyclopedia of Religion&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refers to this form of Pantheism as an &amp;quot;extreme [[monism]],&amp;quot; stating that in Classical Pantheism, &amp;quot;God decides or determines everything, including our supposed decisions.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Religion: Volume 10|year=2005|publisher=MacMillan|location=USA|isbn=0028657330|edition=2nd|editor=Lindsay Jones}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
Other examples of deterministic-inclined pantheisms include the views of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Ernst Haeckel]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].

== Quotations ==
The following quotations illustrate Hartshorne&amp;apos;s concept of Classical Pantheism:

*&amp;quot;For no particular thing, not even the smallest, can have happened otherwise than in accordance with the common nature and its reason.&amp;quot; - [[Chrysippus]] &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Bobzien, Susanne, &amp;quot;Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy&amp;quot;, Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 28&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

*&amp;quot;In the mind there is no absolute or free will; but the mind is determined to wish this or that by a cause, which has also been determined by another cause, and this last by another cause, and so on to infinity.&amp;quot; - [[Baruch Spinoza]] &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Spinoza, Baruch, &amp;quot;The Ethics&amp;quot;, Proposition 48&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Other uses of &amp;quot;Classical Pantheism&amp;quot; ==
*Typical or archetypal pantheism. This usage varies according to the judgement of the writer as to what constitutes typical or archetypal pantheism, but usually includes Spinoza.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Pantheism: A Non-Theistic Concept of Deity, Michael Philip Levine, 1994, p163&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

*Pantheism of the Classical period, specifically Ancient Greece and Rome (for example, [[Stoicism]]).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Paul Harrison, &amp;quot;Elements of Pantheism,&amp;quot; Element Books 1999 p13&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
