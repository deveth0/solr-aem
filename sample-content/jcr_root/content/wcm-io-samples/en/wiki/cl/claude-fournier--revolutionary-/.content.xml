        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Claude Fournier L&amp;apos;Héritier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (21 December 1745 – 1825) was a [[France|French]] personality of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], nicknamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;l&amp;apos;Americain&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;the [[Americas|American]]&amp;quot;).

==Life==
===Early activities===
He was born at [[Auzon]] ([[Haute-Loire]]), the son of a poor weaver, and went to [[French colonization of the Americas|French America]] to seek his fortune. At [[Saint Domingue]] on the island of [[Haiti]], he began the manufacture of [[tafia]] (an inferior quality of [[rum]]), but lost everything in a fire.

===Revolution===
Returning to France, he joined the Revolution with enthusiasm, and distinguished himself by organizing the popular armed force which became involved in all major [[insurrection]]s of the capital: [[French Revolution from the abolition of feudalism to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy#Toward a constitution|the march of women on October 5-6]] (1789), [[French Revolution from the summer of 1790 to the establishment of the Legislative Assembly#Republicanism and the Champ de Mars massacre|Champ-de-Mars massacre]] (1791), and the [[10th of August (French Revolution)|Storming of the Tuileries Palace]] (1792).

He was on bad terms with the majority of the politicians (particularly with [[Jean-Paul Marat]]) and spent much of his time in prison, all governments regarding him as an [[agitator]] and accusing him of inciting to insurrection. Arrested for the first time for trying to force an entrance into the club of the [[Cordeliers]], from which he had been expelled, he was released, but was in prison from 12 December 1793, to 21 September 1794, and again from 9 March to 26 October 1795.

===Consulate, Empire, Restoration===
After the [[Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise|attempt on the First Consul in the Rue Sainte-Nicaise]] he was [[Penal transportation|deported]] to [[French Guiana]], but was allowed to return to the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] in 1809. In 1811, while under surveillance at [[Auxerre]], he was accused of having provoked a riot against [[indirect tax]]es known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;droits réunis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (afterwards called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;contributions indirectes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), and was imprisoned in the [[Château d&amp;apos;If]], where he remained until 1814.

On the second [[Bourbon Restoration]], Fournier was confined for about nine months in [[La Force Prison]]. After 1816 he turned [[House of Bourbon|Royalist]], and passed his last years in importuning the Restoration government for compensation for his lost property in Saint Domingue. He died in obscurity.
