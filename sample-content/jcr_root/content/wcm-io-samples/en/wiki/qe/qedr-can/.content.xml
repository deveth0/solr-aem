        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Qedrîcan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Qedrîcan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (1911–1972), was a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] poet, writer and translator. He was born in [[Derik]], a small village (present-day [[Mardin Province]], south-eastern [[Turkey]]).  At a time when schooling was the subject of jokes and when few people studied Qedrîcan&amp;apos;s father, known as &amp;quot;Cano&amp;quot; (hence the last name) sent him to school.  He was a very successful student, especially in the areas of science and mathematics. Seeing that his son was a successful student Cano decided to send his son to [[Konya]] to study at the teachers&amp;apos; college there.  During his days as a student there Qedrî Can was blacklisted for cultivating &amp;quot;political strife&amp;quot;; he was made a target for writing poetry in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] and was forced to escape Turkey.  At a time after the defeat of the [[Sheikh Said Rebellion]], he escaped to [[Syria]] and lived in [[Damascus]] until his death in 1972.

Qedrîcan is remembered for openly teaching the Kurdish Language to students in Northeastern Syria.  Among his circle of friends are the well known names of renowned Kurdish intellectuals: [[Celadet Bedir Khan]], [[Kamuran Bedir Khan]], Dr. [[Nurettin Zaza]], Dr. [[Nuri Dersimi]], [[Ekrem Cemilpaşa]], [[Kadri Cemilpaşa]], Dr. [[Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou]], and more.

==Works==
Qedrîcan was one of the first Kurdish poets to write poetry in the modern [[Free verse]] style. His poetry is similar to that of [[Vladimir Mayakovsky|Mayakovsky]] and [[Nazim Hikmet]] and he promoted [[socialism]] through his poetry. In addition to poetry, he also wrote short stories and biographies. Most of his works were published in the Kurdish journals &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hawar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ronahî&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Roja Nû&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
