&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Qetesh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{Pronunciation-needed}} is a goddess adopted into [[Egyptian mythology]] from the [[Canaanite religion]], popular during the [[New Kingdom]]. She was a [[fertility goddess]] of [[sacred prostitution|sacred ecstasy]] and sexual pleasure.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=VD1YAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA71&amp;amp;lpg=PA71&amp;amp;dq=Kadesh+city+Qetesh&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=ABxEeP9HPV&amp;amp;sig=6SM95eUz2QAt2BvpD2xhrfBaSm8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=gE_eTpn0JY22tweKs9j3Ag&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Kadesh%20city%20Qetesh&amp;amp;f=false The American journal of urology and sexology]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The name was probably vocalized by Egyptians as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;*Qātiša&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from the [[Semitic root]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Q-D-Š]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; meaning &amp;apos;holy&amp;apos;. Her city of worship was naturally [[Kadesh|Qadesh]].

== Representation ==
[[File:Stele of Qadesh upper-frame.jpg|250px|thumb|Qetesh wearing the headdress of [[Hathor]].]]
In the [[:File:Stele of Qadesh upper-frame.jpg|Qetesh stele]], she is represented as a frontal nude standing on a lion between [[Min (god)|Min]] of Egypt and the Canaanite warrior god [[Resheph]]. She is holding snakes in one hand and a [[Nymphaea caerulea|lotus flower]] in the other as symbols of [[Creation myth|creation]].

She is associated with [[Anat]], [[Astarte]], and [[Asherah]]. She also has elements associated with the goddesses of Myceneae, the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]s of [[Crete]], and certain [[Kassite]] goddesses of the metals trade in Tin, Copper and Bronze between [[Lothal]] and [[Dilmun]].

On some versions of the Qetesh stele her register with Min and Resheph is placed over another register showing gifts being presented to [[Anat]] the goddess of War and below a register listing the lands belonging to Min and Resheph.

{{Main|Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)#Triple-Goddess Stone}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Qudshu-Astarte-Anat&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a representation of a single goddess who is a combination of three goddesses: Qetesh (Athirat &amp;quot;Asherah&amp;quot;), [[Astarte]], and [[Anat]]. It was a common practice for Canaanites and Egyptians to merge different deities through a process of synchronization, thereby, turning them into one single entity. The &amp;quot;Triple-Goddess Stone&amp;quot;, that was once owned by Winchester College, shows the goddess Qetesh with the inscription &amp;quot;Qudshu-Astarte-Anat&amp;quot;, showing their association as being one goddess, and Qetesh (Qudshu) in place of Athirat.
Religious scholar Saul M. Olyan (author of Asherah and the Cult of Yahweh in Israel), calls the representation on the Qudshu-Astarte-Anat plaque &amp;quot;a triple-fusion hypostasis&amp;quot;, and considers Qudshu to be an epithet of Athirat by a process of elimination, for Astarte and Anat appear after Qudshu in the inscription.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The Ugaritic Baal cycle: Volume 2 by Mark S. Smith - Page 295&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel&amp;apos;s Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts by Mark S. Smith - Page 237&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Epithets ==
She is called &amp;quot;Mistress of All the Gods&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Lady of the Stars of Heaven&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Beloved of [[Ptah]]&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Great of magic, mistress of the stars&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;[[Eye of Ra]], without her equal&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.matrifocus.com/LAM07/spotlight.htm The &amp;quot;Holy One&amp;quot; by Johanna Stuckey]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Qadshu is also used as an epithet of [[Athirat]], the Great Mother Goddess of the Canaanites.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.thaliatook.com/OGOD/qadshu.html Qadshu, the Holy One, Goddess of Sexuality-Canaanite goddess Egyptian Goddess Qedeshet Qadesh Kedesh Fertility Goddess Mother Goddess thalia took Phoenician Goddesses, the Obs...]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== In popular culture ==
Qetesh is the name given to the [[Goa&amp;apos;uld]] that once possessed [[Vala Mal Doran]], a recurring and then regular character in Seasons 9 and 10, respectively of the science fiction television series [[Stargate SG-1]].
