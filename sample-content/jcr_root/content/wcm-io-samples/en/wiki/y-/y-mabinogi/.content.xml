&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Y Mabinogi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (English title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Otherworld&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: not a literal translation) is a 2003 [[Wales|Welsh]] film based on a series of Welsh tales written by bards in the Middle Ages. It is mostly [[animation|animated]], although the very beginning and end sequences are [[live action]]. It follows three main characters who find themselves moving from their world in [[West Wales]] to the setting of the tales of [[Welsh mythology]] known as the [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi]] (Welsh: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pedair Cainc y Mabinogi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, often referred to as simply &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Y Mabinogi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), from which the film&amp;apos;s title is derived. The film is available in both [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[English language]] versions, as is the [[graphic novel]] on which the film is based.
