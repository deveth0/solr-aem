&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Déagol&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a fictional character in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]&amp;apos;s [[Tolkien&amp;apos;s legendarium|legendarium]]. His story is related in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the first of three volumes comprising Tolkien&amp;apos;s most famous novel, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Lord of the Rings]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in the chapter &amp;quot;The Shadow of the Past&amp;quot;.

==Biography==
Déagol was a [[Stoor]] [[Hobbit]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{ME-ref|UT|Part Three, IV. &amp;quot;The Hunt for the Ring&amp;quot;, p 353, note 9}}. In a letter quoted by Christopher Tolkien, Tolkien refers to Déagol and Sméagol as Stoors.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; who lived in a small community bound by kinship ties—akin to a [[clan]]. He had a relative&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{ME-ref|fotr|&amp;quot;The Shadow of the Past&amp;quot;}} They are popularly thought to be cousins, but Tolkien only calls them &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Lord of the Rings&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In a later letter (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, #214) he writes that they were &amp;quot;evidently relatives&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; named [[Gollum|Sméagol]], whose grandmother was the [[matriarch]] of the community.

In 2463 of the [[Third Age]], Déagol became the third [[One Ring#Ring-bearers|bearer]] of the [[One Ring]], after [[Sauron]] and [[Isildur]]. He found the Ring—which had been lost for thousands of years—while fishing with Sméagol in the [[Gladden (Middle-earth)|Gladden]] river.

Instantly ensnared by its beauty and seductive power, Sméagol demanded the Ring as his &amp;quot;birthday-present&amp;quot;. When Déagol refused to give it up, Sméagol strangled him and hid his body, which was never found; nevertheless, the murderer (nicknamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Gollum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; after the swallowing noises he made) was eventually driven from his home and into the [[Misty Mountains]].

==Name==
{{further2|[[Gollum#Name|Gollum]]}}
The name &amp;quot;Déagol&amp;quot; is from [[Old English]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;dēagol&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (more commonly spelt &amp;apos;&amp;apos;dīegol&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), meaning &amp;quot;secretive&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ntc&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=The New Tolkien Companion|year=1977|last=Tyler|first=J.E.A.|isbn=0380469049}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In Tolkien&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Red Book of Westmarch]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the name &amp;quot;Déagol&amp;quot; is used as a translation of the &amp;quot;original&amp;quot; name in the author-invented language of [[Westron]], &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nahald&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ntc&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; which has the same meaning.

==Adaptations==
Déagol appears in the prologue to [[Ralph Bakshi]]&amp;apos;s 1978 animated adaptation of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Lord of the Rings]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In [[Peter Jackson]]&amp;apos;s 2001–2003 [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|live-action adaptations]] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Lord of the Rings&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Déagol is played by New Zealand actor [[Thomas Robins]]. His scenes with [[Andy Serkis]] (Sméagol/Gollum) were originally planned to be in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but were moved to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
