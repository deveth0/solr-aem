        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Delbert Ray Fulkerson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (August 14, 1924 – January 10, 1976) was a [[mathematician]] who co-developed the [[Ford{{Ndash}}Fulkerson algorithm]], one of the most well-known [[algorithm]]s to solve the [[maximum flow problem]] in [[network flow|networks]].

==Early life and education==
Fulkerson was brought up in small-town southern [[Illinois]] and became an undergraduate at [[Southern Illinois University]]. His academic career was interrupted by military service during [[World War II]]. Having returned to complete his degree after the war, he went on to do a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in mathematics at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] under the supervision of [[Cyrus Colton MacDuffee|Cyrus MacDuffee]], who was a student of [[L. E. Dickson]]. Fulkerson received his Ph.D. in 1951.

==Career==
He was then with the mathematics department at the [[RAND Corporation]] until 1971 when he moved to [[Cornell University]] as the Maxwell Upson Professor of Engineering. He remained at Cornell until he committed suicide in 1976.

Fulkerson was the supervisor of [[Jon Folkman]] at RAND.

In 1956, he published his noted paper on the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book

}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
together with [[L.R. Ford, Jr.]]. In 1979, the renowned [[Fulkerson Prize]] was established which is now awarded every three years for outstanding papers in [[discrete mathematics]] jointly by the [[Mathematical Programming Society]] and the [[American Mathematical Society]].
