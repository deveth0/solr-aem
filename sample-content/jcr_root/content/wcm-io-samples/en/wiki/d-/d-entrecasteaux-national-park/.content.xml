&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;D&amp;apos;Entrecasteaux National Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a national park in [[Western Australia]] ([[Australia]]), {{convert|315|km}} south of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].  The park is named after the French Admiral [[Bruni D&amp;apos;Entrecasteaux]] who was the first European to sight the area and name [[Point D&amp;apos;Entrecasteaux]] in 1792.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dec.wa.gov.au/component/option,com_docman/Itemid,1/gid,2602/task,doc_download/|title=D&amp;apos;Entrecasteaux National Park |year=2008|accessdate=4 March 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Description==
The park stretches {{convert|130|km|abbr=on}} from Black Point in the west to Long Point in the east and extends inland as far as {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}}.  Black Point is made of [[basalt]] columns from a lava flow that occurred 135 million years ago.  An interesting feature in the park is Yeagarup dune, a mobile {{convert|10|km|adj=on}} long sand dune found to the west of [[Lake Jasper]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coastshop.com.au/national_parks/wa/D&amp;apos;Entrecasteaux.htm|title=West Australia Albany - D&amp;apos;Entrecasteaux National Park |year=2009|accessdate=4 March 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The park contains a great variety of scenery including beaches, sand-dunes, coastal cliffs, coastal [[Heath (habitat)|heath]] and pockets of [[Karri]] forest. Rivers such as the [[Warren River (Western Australia)|Warren]], the [[Donnelly River (Western Australia)|Donnelly]] and the [[Shannon River (Western Australia)|Shannon]] flow through the park and discharge into the waters off-shore.

Important large scale [[wetland]]s, known as the Blackwater, and lakes such as [[Lake Jasper]] and [[Lake Yeagarup]] are found within the park boundaries.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;dec.wa.gov.au&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/component/option,com_hotproperty/task,view/id,93/Itemid,755/|title=Department of Environment - Parkfinder|year=2009|accessdate=26 September 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Broke Inlet]] is contained within the park boundaries at iys eastern end; it is the only inlet in the South West that has not been significantly altered within the catchment area. The [[gneiss]] basement rocks project through the shallow waters to form small islands in the Inlet.

[[Sandy Island (Windy Harbour)|Sandy Island]] in Windy Harbour is part of the park; it is an important nesting site for [[seabird]]s, with up to 300,000 breeding pairs of [[Flesh-footed Shearwater]]s, a high proportion of the global population.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Sandy Island (Windy Harbour)|accessdate=3 October 2011|work= Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Facilities==
The park has an entry fee that applies to all visitors.
Facilities available to visitors include barbecues, toilets, 4WD tracks, camp sites, disabled access and picnic areas. Canoeing facilities also exist within the park on the [[Deep River]]. Rangers regularly patrol the area.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;dec.wa.gov.au&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

The [[Bibbulmun Track]] passes through the park area.

The outdoor education organisation, [[Outward Bound]], operate within the park taking school groups on hiking expeditions.
