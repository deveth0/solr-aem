        text="&lt;p&gt;{{Unreferenced|date=March 2007}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ijuin Tada&amp;apos;aki&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;(伊集院忠朗; 1520-1561) a retainer of the Japanese clan of [[Shimazu clan|Shimazu]] following the [[Sengoku period]] of the 16th century of Japan. Under Tada&amp;apos;aki, [[Ijuin clan]] would rise to the prominence as one of the most important retainer in the [[Shimazu clan]].

He served under [[Shimazu Tadayoshi]] and [[Shimazu Takahisa]] was essential in uniting [[Shimazu clan]], and battles against [[Ito clan]] and [[Kimotsuki clan]].  At the [[siege of Iwatsurugi]] in 1554, it was recorded that Tada&amp;apos;aki had his troop use matchlock guns against enemies for the first time by the [[Shimazu clan|Shimazu]] army. For this and other contributions and services, he held the post of the top [[karo]] until 1556 and governed as the top official of the clan.

It is recorded that on 1561 while having a party with [[Kimotsuki Kanetsugu]], Tada&amp;apos;aki offended Kanetsugu so well that humiliated Kanetsugu started a war that the [[Shimazu clan]] wanted all along.
