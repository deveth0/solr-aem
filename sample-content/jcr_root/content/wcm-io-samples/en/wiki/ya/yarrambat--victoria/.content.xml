&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yarrambat&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a town in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], 23.5&amp;amp;nbsp;km north-east of [[Melbourne|Melbourne&amp;apos;s]] [[Melbourne City Centre|Central Business District]]. Its [[Local government areas of Victoria|local government area]] is the [[Shire of Nillumbik]]. At the [[Census in Australia#2011|2011 Census]], Yarrambat had a population of 1,511.

Yarrambat is located within [[Greater Melbourne]], beyond the Melbourne metropolitan area Urban Growth Boundary.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/melbourne2030online/content/popups/fig_ip02_01.html Urban Growth Boundary map]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
{{section-stub|date=December 2012}}
Prominent as a gold mining area in the late 19th century, much of the land was surveyed and cleared for farming once the mining boom subsided. {{fact|date=December 2012}}

The Post Office opened on 1 March 1910 as Tanck&amp;apos;s Corner and was renamed Yarrambat around 1928.&amp;lt;ref name = &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Citation
  | last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&amp;amp;country= | accessdate = 2008-04-11 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Today==

Recently land has been allowed to be subdivided into 1 hectare allotments by the Shire of Nillumbik, with large prestige homes dotting the landscape. {{fact|date=December 2012}}Yarrambat has become one of Melbourne&amp;apos;s affluent north eastern suburbs due to many of its properties being constructed on large allotments within relatively close proximity to the City.

==Facilities==
It contains a post office, veterinarian clinic, child minding centre, recreation reserve, war memorial, a primary school (Yarrambat Primary School), a private school, a general store and a [[Country Fire Authority|CFA]] fire station, as well as a railway museum.

In 1978, Yarrambat celebrated its centenary, including a festival at the primary school, which at that time was adjacent to the main T-intersection (which has been referred to as Tanck&amp;apos;s Corner). The school was relocated to new buildings in the 1980s. Further upgrades (in excess of $3 million (AUD)) to the school have occurred during 2007, the most prominent feature being 5 open plan classrooms, office redevelopment and a gymnasium (3/4 size basketball court). The school has spent significant time and effort into developing Inquiry Based Learning.


==Sport==
Golfers play at the Yarrambat Park Golf Course on Yan Yean Road.&amp;lt;ref name = &amp;quot;golf&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Citation  | author= Golf Select | title = Yarrambat Park | url = http://www.golfselect.com.au/armchair/courseView.aspx?course_id=1735 | accessdate = 2009-05-11 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The [Yarrambat-Plenty Little Athletics Club] competes as part of the [Diamond Valley Little Athletics Centre].
