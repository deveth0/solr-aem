&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yann Wehrling&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 3 July 1971 in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]]) is an [[illustrator]], [[France|French]] [[politician]], [[Democratic Movement (France)|Democratic Movement]] member and former leader of the political party [[The Greens (France)|The Greens]].

==Life==

In 1988 he joined the [[Environmentalism|environmental]] movement &amp;quot;France Nature Environnement&amp;quot; and in the following year joined The Greens. From 1992 to 1994 he was the National Secretary of &amp;quot;EcoloJ&amp;quot;, a youth environmental organisation. After completing his studies of [[fine arts]] in Strasbourg in 1994, he worked as an illustrator in publishing, for the French-German television channel [[Arte]], and for the Irish channel [[TnaG]]. He then became a spokesman for The Greens. In January 2005 he was elected the National Secretary of The Greens with 62% of the vote, coming after long and protracted negotiations. In December 2006 [[Cécile Duflot]] succeeded him to the post.

He belonged to the environmentalist wing of the party, named &amp;quot;Pôle Écolo&amp;quot; (the Eco-Pole) ou &amp;quot;Écolo&amp;quot; (Eco). He worked with fellow Green politicians in the [[European Parliament]].

In 2008 he became a member of [[François Bayrou]]&amp;apos;s Democratic Movement.

He is a specialist in wild [[fauna (animals)|fauna]], and an expert on the reintroduction of the [[lynx]] into the [[Vosges]] forest.

==Media action==

On 22 March 2005, for the [[World Day for Water]], he took a swim in the [[Seine]] river in [[Paris]], along with three other members of the Executive College of the Greens. Their reason behind this action was to denounce [[pollution]] in [[List of rivers in France|French rivers]] and to urge the government to reexamine its environmental policy in this regard. French President [[Jacques Chirac]] had—in a sense—promised much the same thing in regard to the Seine river during time as [[mayor of Paris]].
