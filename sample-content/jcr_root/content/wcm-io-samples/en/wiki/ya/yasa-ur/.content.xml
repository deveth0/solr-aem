        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yasa&amp;apos;ur&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (died 1320) was a [[Chagatai Khans|Chagatai]] prince who launched a revolt against the [[Ilkhan]] [[Abu Sa&amp;apos;id (Ilkhanid dynasty)|Abu Sa&amp;apos;id]]. He was the son of Chübei, and a great-great-grandson of [[Chagatai Khan]].

Yasa&amp;apos;ur had originally resided within the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ulus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]]. In 1314 he participated in a campaign against the Ilkhanate, together with the Chagatai Khan&amp;apos;s brother [[Kebek]] and a [[Neguderi]] prince [[Daud Khwaja]](a son of [[Qutlugh Khwaja]]) who had been expelled from his territories by the Ilkhan the previous year. Their forces defeated the Ilkhan army near the banks of the [[Murgab River (Afghanistan)|Murgab River]]; they then marched to [[Herat]]. The Ilkhan [[Öljeitü]] then set off with an army for the east, while the Chagataiid forces were recalled by the khan [[Esen Buqa I|Esen Buqa]].

Around this time Yasa&amp;apos;ur, who had been accused by Kebek of cooperated with the Ilkhanid forces during the invasion, defected to Öljeitü. His forces engaged in battle with the Chagataiid troops; an Ilkhanid army that had crossed the [[Oxus]] joined the fighting and secured victory for Yasa&amp;apos;ur. He, escorted by the Ilkhanid force, entered [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]; Öljeitü then allowed him to take control of the pasture lands of the [[Badghis]].

Öljeitü died in 1316 and was succeeded as Ilkhan by his son Abu Sa&amp;apos;id. Yasa&amp;apos;ur initially pledged loyalty to the new Ilkhan, but was apparently uncooperative with Ilkhanid authorities. In early 1319 he openly revolted against Abu Sa&amp;apos;id, invading the province of [[Mazandaran]]. This revolt coincided with an invasion by [[Uzbeg Khan]], forcing the Ilkhanids to defend against two attacks simultaneously. Amir Husain (the father of [[Hasan Buzurg]], who founded the [[Jalayirid]] dynasty in [[Baghdad]]) was sent to deal with Yasa&amp;apos;ur. The Amir [[Coban (Chobanids)|Coban]], overestimating the strength of Yasa&amp;apos;ur, also planned to march against the Chagataiid prince at the head of a 20,000-strong army, but eventually decided to defend against Uzbeg&amp;apos;s forces.

Amir Husain&amp;apos;s approach caused Yasa&amp;apos;ur to retreat from Mazandaran. From [[Tus, Iran|Tus]] he then sent a force to take [[Herat]], whose ruler, the [[Kartids|Kartid]] Giyath al-Din, had declared his loyalty to the Ilkhanids. The siege of Herat was unsuccessful, however, as Yasa&amp;apos;ur decided to withdraw upon hearing of the approach of the Ilkhanid army and withdrew into southern [[Afghanistan]]. In the following year, he was killed by Kebek, who had recently become Chagatai Khan and who deemed Yasa&amp;apos;ur to still be a threat.

Yasa&amp;apos;ur&amp;apos;s personal troops eventually formed the basis of the [[Yasa&amp;apos;uri]], a group that gained influence within the Chagatai &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ulus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the mid-fourteenth century.
