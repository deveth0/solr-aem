&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yakhini&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-he-n|יָכִינִי}}) is an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[moshav]] in southern [[Israel]]. Located in the northern [[Negev]] desert near the town of [[Sderot]], it falls under the jurisdiction of [[Sha&amp;apos;ar HaNegev Regional Council]]. In 2006 it had a population of 476.

The moshav was founded in 1950 by [[Jew]]ish immigrants from [[Yemen]], who were brought to Israel during [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]], when most [[Yemenite Jews]] arrived in the country. The moshav is named for one of the sons of [[Simeon]], son of the patriarch [[Jacob]], as it is located in territory that belonged to the [[Tribe of Simeon]] in [[Bible|biblical]] times (Numbers 26:12).
