A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;yard globe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;gazing ball&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;lawn ball&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;garden ball&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;gazing globe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;mirror ball&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;chrome ball&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a mirrored sphere typically displayed atop a conical ceramic or wrought iron stand as a [[lawn ornament]]. Its size ranges from 2 to 22&amp;amp;nbsp;inches in diameter, with the most popular gazing ball being about 12&amp;amp;nbsp;inches (33&amp;amp;nbsp;cm).  Gazing balls were glass but can now be stainless steel, ceramic, or stained glass.

Unlike hanging [[friendship ball]]s or [[witch ball]]s that have a loop, gazing balls have a stem so they can securely sit in a stand. Larger sizes can be made, but may be difficult due to the weight of the blown glass.

==History==
Gazing balls originated in 13th century [[Venice]] where they were hand-blown by skilled Italian craftsmen.

King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], sometimes referred to as Mad King Ludwig, adorned his [[Herrenchiemsee]] palace with lawn balls. Thereafter, they became a fixture of European gardens and are associated with [[Victorian era]] English gardens in particular.
