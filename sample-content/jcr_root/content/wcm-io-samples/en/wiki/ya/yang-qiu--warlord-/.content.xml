&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yang Qiu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (birth and death dates unknown) was a warlord who lived in the late [[Eastern Han Dynasty]].

==Life==
Around 211, Yang Qiu joined a coalition of warlords in the [[Guanzhong]] region, led by [[Ma Chao]] and [[Han Sui]], and rebelled against the Han imperial court (controlled by [[Cao Cao]]). The coalition was defeated by Cao Cao&amp;apos;s forces at the [[Battle of Tong Pass (211)|Battle of Tong Pass]], after which Yang Qiu fled to Anding (安定; around present-day [[Pingliang]], [[Gansu]]). In the winter of 211, Cao Cao led an army from [[Chang&amp;apos;an]] to attack and besiege Yang Qiu in Anding. Yang Qiu surrendered. He was restored of his former titles awarded by the Han imperial court and allowed to remain in his former territory in northwestern China and pacify the people there.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;(是時關中諸將疑繇欲自襲，馬超遂與韓遂、楊秋、李堪、成宜等叛。 ... 公乃與克日會戰，先以輕兵挑之，戰良乆，乃縱虎騎夾擊，大破之，斬成宜、李堪等。遂、超等走涼州，楊秋奔安定，關中平。 ... 冬十月，軍自長安北征楊秋，圍安定。秋降，復其爵位，使留撫其民人。) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sanguozhi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; vol. 1.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Yang Qiu served in the state of [[Cao Wei]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period after the fall of the Han Dynasty in 220. In [[Cao Pi]]&amp;apos;s reign, he was appointed as &amp;quot;General Who Attacks Bandits&amp;quot; (討寇將軍) and gradually rose through the ranks until he was enfeoffed as &amp;quot;Marquis of Linjing&amp;quot; (臨涇侯). He died of natural causes.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;(魏略曰：楊秋，黃初中遷討寇將軍，位特進，封臨涇侯，以壽終。) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Weilue&amp;apos;&amp;apos; annotation in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sanguozhi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; vol. 1.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
