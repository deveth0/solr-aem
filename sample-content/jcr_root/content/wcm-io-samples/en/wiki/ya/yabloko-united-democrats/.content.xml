&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yabloko-United Democrats&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a coalition between [[Yabloko]] party and the [[Union of Right Forces]] formed for the Moscow municipal elections on December 4, 2005.

During the campaign the coalition declared its opposition to the policies of President [[Vladimir Putin]] and called for the restoration of political and media freedoms, curtailed by the Putin administration. Yabloko-United Democrats won 11% of the vote and became one of only three parties (along with [[United Russia]] and the [[Communist Party]]) to enter the new Moscow City Duma. Its deputies in the Duma are Yevgeny Bunimovich ([[Yabloko]]), Sergei Mitrokhin ([[Yabloko]]) and Ivan Novitsky ([[Union of Right Forces]]).
