&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yarramundi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[suburb]] of [[Sydney]], in the state of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Yarramundi is located 69 kilometres west of the [[Sydney central business district]], in the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of the [[City of Hawkesbury]].

==History==
The suburb is named after [[Yarramundi]], an [[Indigenous Australian]] of the Boorooberongal clan of the [[Darug people]]. He was a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;garadyi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;[[shamanism|doctor]]&amp;apos; and was called by Europeans &amp;apos;the chief of the [[Richmond, New South Wales|Richmond]] Tribe&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.brewongle-e.schools.nsw.edu.au/bundeluk.htm Brewongle Environmental Education Centre &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aboriginal studies &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Bundeluk&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

This area was previously known as Kearns Retreat.

Nepean Sand and Gravel Limited established a sand mine on the island at Yarramundi Falls in 1925. An aerial ropeway connected the island with railway sidings near Phillip, where the former railway to [[Kurrajong, New South Wales|Kurrajong]] crossed the river. Following a flood which destroyed the ropeway, a railway was laid in 1927 from the existing sidings to the mine on the island. This railway was operated by their own locomotives. In July 1946, the transport was replaced by road trucks.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Sydney&amp;apos;s Forgotten Quarry Railways Oakes, John ISBN 0-9757870-3-9 pp53-64&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
