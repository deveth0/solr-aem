&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HaRav HaGaon Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky זצוק&amp;quot;ל&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Steipler&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Steipler Gaon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1899&amp;amp;ndash;1985), was a [[rabbi]], [[Talmud]]ic scholar, and [[posek]] (&amp;quot;decisor&amp;quot; of Jewish law).

==Biography==
He was born in the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] town of [[Hornostaypil]], from which his appellation, &amp;quot;the Steipler&amp;quot;, was later derived. He was the son of Rabbi Chaim Peretz, who was a [[Chernobyl (Hasidic dynasty)|Chernobyl]] [[Chassid]] and the local [[shochet]]. Around the age of 11, Rabbi Kanievsky entered the [[Navahradak|Novardok]] [[yeshiva]], studying under its famed [[Rosh yeshiva|dean]], Rabbi Yosef Yoizel Horowitz.

Having progressed rapidly and gained a reputation as a [[Talmid Chacham]], around the age of 19 he was sent by Rabbi Horowitz to set up a branch of the yeshiva in [[Rogochov]]. However, the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] was in full swing and Rabbi Kanievsky was [[Conscription|conscripted]] into the [[Red Army]]. In spite of the harsh conditions, he continued to strictly observe all the [[Mitzvah|mitzvot]].

Once, during his army stint, Rabbi Kanievsky was [[Court-martial]]led for &amp;quot;failing to do his duty&amp;quot; when there was a possibility of breaking the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. He was forced to walk between two rows of soldiers who were ordered to beat him as he passed. In later years, Rabbi Kanievsky remarked that the satisfaction he had enjoyed for making a stand for his religious convictions was an achievement never again equaled for the rest of his life. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

After serving under arms for some time, Rabbi Kanievsky managed to get discharged. He decided to move to [[Białystok]] in [[Poland]] in order to continue learning Torah unhindered from Communist interference. There, he studied under Rabbi Avrohom Jofen.

In 1925, Rabbi Kanievsky published his first [[Sefer (Hebrew)|sefer]] (&amp;quot;work&amp;quot;), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sha&amp;apos;arei Tevunah&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;gates of understanding&amp;quot;). This was received with great acclaim, and the work eventually reached Rabbi [[Avraham Yeshayahu Karelitz]] (known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chazon Ish&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) in [[Vilnius|Vilna]]. Without even meeting him, Rabbi Karelitz decided that the author of such a work was worthy of marrying his sister Miriam.

Rabbi Kanievsky was then appointed [[rosh yeshiva]] of the Novarodok yeshiva in [[Pinsk]]. In 1934, he left Poland and moved to [[Israel]], settling in [[Bnei Brak]], where his brother-in-law Rabbi Karelitz had already been living for a year and a half. For many years he was head of two yeshivas there. Though known as a world-class scholar, Rabbi Kanievsky shunned publicity and lived in humble surroundings, teaching, writing and devoting himself to [[Torah]] and good deeds.

Over 150,000 mourners attended Rabbi Kanievsky&amp;apos;s funeral in 1985. His son, Rabbi [[Chaim Kanievsky]], following in his father&amp;apos;s path, is a world renowned Haredi rabbinical authority. He also has a daughter who currently lives in Bnei Brak.

The Steipler [[Gaon]] wrote many works, his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] being the multi-volume &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kehillos Yaakov&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;assembly of [[Jacob]]&amp;quot;), containing his unique analysis of most of the tractates and concepts of the [[Talmud]]. He also authored &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Birkas Peretz&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (on the [[Torah]]) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chayei Olam&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. There are several volumes of letters, known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Karyana D’Igarata&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and several volumes written by a disciple, Rabbi A Horowitz, describe his daily life. These are known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Orchos Rabbeinu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
