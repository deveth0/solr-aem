The {{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yamazaki&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|山崎}} are descendants of a samurai clan from [[Kawagoe, Saitama|Kawagoe]] in the [[Kantō region]] of Japan.  The Yamazaki line dates from the 18th century, and their land was awarded by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], the first [[shogun]] of the [[Edo Period]].

== Descendants ==
The Yamazaki family is headed today by Yamazaki Harunaga, he is named after the founder of the Clan (see history), the 7th family leader. Yamazaki Hirotaka was the family leader leader before Harunaga and was also harunaga&amp;apos;s caretaker and teacher. Mori Aya (not the clan from the aki province) claims herself as a subordunate to the Yamazaki clan due to a battle between her clan and the Yamazaki in the 15th century.

== Hirotaka Yamazaki ==
Hirotaka was born (September 5, 1920-October 16, 2008) in the Gunma prefecture along with his friend Kiyoshi Ogawa. Hirotaka married Ito Mizuki and had 2 children who were killed in the Tokyo bombing raid. Hirotaka enlisted in the Imperial Japanese army in 1938 and participated in the invasion of Hong Kong and the Philippines and was promoted to lieutenant. Hirotaka was captured on Iwo Jima on top of Mt.suribachi 2 hours after the flag raising.
