The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yamaha FZX750&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[motorcycle]] made in [[Japan]] from the early 1980s until the mid-1990s, although was only imported as a non [[grey import]] into the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in the 1980s.  The US version was known as the FZX-700 Fazer, and was imported only in 1986 and 1987.

Its engine was a retuned version of the [[four-stroke]] [[DOHC]] twenty-valve four-cylinder inline [[engine]] found in the [[Yamaha FZ750|FZ750]], producing ten [[Horsepower#Brake horsepower|BHP]] less than the 105 of the sports model, but having a stronger midrange.

Designed as a custom, it featured an almost solid rear wheel, low seat, and more [[Chrome plating|chrome]] than would normally be expected.  Unusually, it had downdraft carburettors built into the design of the thirteen-litre tank.

Frequently referred to as the mini or baby [[Yamaha V-Max]] due to a slight similarity in style, it could hold its own against the larger more powerful bike, due to its far lower weight and twenty-valve aspiration.

Its current values remain high, due to its attractive unaging style, and the seat being low enough for shorter riders.
