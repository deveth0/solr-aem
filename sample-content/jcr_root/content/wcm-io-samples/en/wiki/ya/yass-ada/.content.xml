&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yassıada&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (meaning &amp;quot;Flat Island&amp;quot; in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]; [[Greek language|Greek]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Πλάτη&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Plati&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)) is one of the [[Princes&amp;apos; Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]], to the southeast of [[Istanbul]]. The island, which has an area of 0.05&amp;amp;nbsp;km², is officially a neighbourhood in the [[Adalar]] (meaning &amp;quot;Isles&amp;quot; in Turkish) district of [[Istanbul Province]], [[Turkey]].

Yassıada was used by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] for sending prominent figures into exile. One such person was the [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Patriarch]] ([[Catholicos]]) [[Saint Narses|Narses]] who was first sent to this island before being imprisoned at [[Büyükada]] in the 4th century AD. In the 11th century AD the Byzantines used the island for political prisoners. The remains of the 4 underground prison cells from this period can still be seen. The Byzantines also built a monastery and church on the island. Yassıada (Plati) was captured by the Latin Crusaders during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.

In 1857, Yassıada was purchased by the British ambassador [[Henry Bulwer, 1st Baron Dalling and Bulwer|Henry Bulwer]], brother of novelist [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], who built himself a mansion and a number of other structures to live undisturbed on this distant island. Henry Bulwer also organized agricultural production on the island to self-sustain his little realm at least to a certain degree, but later sold Yassıada to the [[Khedive]] of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Ottoman Egypt and Sudan]], [[Khedive Ismail|Ismail Pasha]]; who, however, didn&amp;apos;t construct any new buildings and completely neglected the island.

With the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, the island became a property of the Turkish state, and in 1947 Yassıada was handed over to the [[Turkish Navy]] which built several school buildings. Between 1960 and 1961, these school buildings became the venue for the trials of the members of the former ruling party, [[Democrat Party (Turkey, historical)|Demokrat Parti]], after the [[1960 Turkish coup d&amp;apos;état|military coup of 1960]]. Several of the defendants were sentenced to death, and three of these, including the former [[List of Prime Ministers of Turkey|Prime Minister]] [[Adnan Menderes]], were taken to [[İmralı|İmralı Island]] (further southwest, near the southern shoreline of the Sea of Marmara) and executed there in 1961.

After the end of the trials, Yassıada was given back to the Turkish Navy and lessons continued to take place at the naval school buildings until 1978.

In 1993, the island became a property of [[Istanbul University]]&amp;apos;s department of Marine Life and Sea Products, which used it for lessons and research. However, the strong winds on the island made life difficult for the students and eventually classes were held elsewhere.

Today, the island is a favourite location for [[scuba diving]] schools like Balıkadam Türkiye&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.balikadamturkiye.com Balıkadam Türkiye Scuba Diving Club]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; as well as amateur divers.
