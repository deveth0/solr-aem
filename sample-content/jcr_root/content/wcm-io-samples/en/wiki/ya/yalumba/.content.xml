&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yalumba&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a winery located near [[Angaston, South Australia]] in the [[Barossa Valley (wine)|Barossa Valley]]. It was founded by a British brewer, Samuel Smith, who emigrated to Australia with his family from [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]], Dorset in August 1847 aboard the ship &amp;apos;China&amp;apos;. Upon arriving in Australia in December, Smith built a small house on the banks of the [[River Torrens]]. He lived there less than a year before moving north to [[Angaston, South Australia|Angaston]] where he purchased a {{convert|30|acre|m2|sing=on}} block of land on the settlement&amp;apos;s south eastern boundary. He named his property &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yalumba&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; after an [[indigenous Australian]] word for &amp;quot;all the land around&amp;quot;. In 1849 Samuel Smith, along with his son Sidney, planted Yalumba&amp;apos;s first vineyards, beginning the Yalumba dynasty. Today Yalumba is Australia&amp;apos;s oldest family-owned winery.
