&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yang Wei&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|s=杨维|t=楊維|p=Yáng Wéi}}; [[Yale Romanization|Yale]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yeung Wai&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; born January 13, 1979 in [[Hubei]], [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China|China]]) is a female [[badminton]] player from the [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China]]. Yang grew up in [[Guangdong]].

==Career==
A woman&amp;apos;s doubles specialist, Yang has won some forty international titles, most of them in the sport&amp;apos;s top tier events, since 1998. Prior to 2003 she partnered [[Huang Nanyan]] with whom she earned a silver medal at the [[Badminton at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]] and gained the winning point against [[Korea national badminton team|South Korea]] in the [[2002 Uber Cup]] (women&amp;apos;s world team championship) final. Her subsequent partnership with [[Zhang Jiewen]] has been even more successful as they have shared international domination with compatriot rivals [[Gao Ling]] and [[Huang Sui]]. Yang and Zhang captured gold at the [[Badminton at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympics]] by defeating Gao and Huang in the final. They bested the same team in winning both the [[2005 IBF World Championships|2005]] and [[2007 BWF World Championships]]. On the other hand, Gao and Huang have been an obstacle for them at the prestigious [[All England Open Badminton Championships|All-England Championships]], defeating Yang and Zhang in the [[2003 All England Open Badminton Championships|2003]], [[2004 All England Open Badminton Championships|2004]], and [[2006 All England Open Badminton Championships|2006]] finals. Curiously, this is the one major tournament that neither Yang nor Zhang has ever won.

In [[2008 Uber Cup|2008]] Yang helped [[China national badminton team|China]] to secure its sixth consecutive [[Uber Cup]] title and won women&amp;apos;s doubles at the [[Swiss Open (badminton)|Swiss]], [[Thailand Open (badminton)|Thailand]], and [[Malaysia Open (badminton)|Malaysia Opens]] with Zhang Jiewen. At the [[Badminton at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]] where they were first seeded, however, Yang and Zhang were upset in the quarterfinals by Japan&amp;apos;s [[Miyuki Maeda]] and [[Satoko Suetsuna]]. The event was eventually won by a younger Chinese pair, [[Du Jing]] and [[Yu Yang (badminton)|Yu Yang]], perhaps signaling a changing of the guard in the Chinese dynasty.
