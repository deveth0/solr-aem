&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yarra Glen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a town in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], 40&amp;amp;nbsp;km north-east from Melbourne&amp;apos;s [[Melbourne city centre|central business district]]. Its [[Local government areas of Victoria|local government area]] is the [[Shire of Yarra Ranges]]. At the [[Census in Australia#2006|2006 Census]], Yarra Glen had a population of 2598.

==History==
The Ryrie brothers (William, James and Donald) were the first Europeans to settle in the area, when they established the {{convert|43,000|acre|km2}} Yering run in 1837 after droving their cattle to the area from NSW. The brothers planted the first grape vines in the Yarra Valley in 1838 and produced their first wine in 1845.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Citation | title = Yarra Glen | publisher = Heritage Australia

}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Joseph Furphy]], often regarded as the father of the Australian novel, was born on the station in 1843.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Citation

The Post Office opened on 11 January 1861 as Yarra Flats and was renamed Yarra Glen in 1889 when the [[Healesville railway line|railway]] arrived.&amp;lt;ref name = &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Citation| last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&amp;amp;country= | accessdate = 2008-04-11 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The now National Trust-listed Yarra Glen Grand Hotel was established in 1888.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;YarraGlen&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Citation | title = Yarra Glen | publisher = Tourism Victoria

}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Its four story Italianate tower was added subsequent to the construction of the original hotel building.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;YarraGlen&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

The [[Black Friday (1939)|Black Friday]] fires of 1939 badly damaged the area around Yarra Glen, as did [[2009 Victoria bushfires|the fires of 2009]].
