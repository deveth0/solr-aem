==History==

The creek at Yarraman was used in the 1870s as a place for local [[graziers]] and [[Stockman (Australia)|stockmen]] to meet and trade [[cattle]]. The township was established in the late 1870s.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;South Burnett Net: Yarraman&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.thecomputertechnicalcentre.com/Southburnett/yarraman.htm South Burnett Net: Yarraman], accessed 17 Jan 2010&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

A [[school]] was opened in 1910.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;South Burnett Net: Yarraman&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

As there were many large [[Hoop Pine]] forests in the area, a [[timber mill]] was established in 1910.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;South Burnett Net: Yarraman&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

The town was connected to [[Brisbane]] and [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] by [[railway]] in 1913.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;South Burnett Net: Yarraman&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; The railway line was closed in 1988.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;qp&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://queenslandplaces.com.au/yarraman Queensland Places: Yarraman], accessed 17 Jan 2010&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
