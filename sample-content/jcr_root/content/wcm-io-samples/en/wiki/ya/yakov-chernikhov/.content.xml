[[File:chernikhov tower.jpg|thumb|right|Tower of the &amp;apos;Krasny Gvozdilshchik&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;Red Carnation&amp;apos;) Factory in St. Petersburg, February 2006]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yakov Georgievich Chernikhov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Яков Георгиевич Чернихов) (5 (17) December 1889, [[Pavlohrad]], Ukraine – 9 May 1951, Moscow) was a [[Constructivist architecture|constructivist]] architect and [[graphic designer]]. His books on architectural design published in [[Saint-Petersburg|Leningrad]] between 1927 and 1933 are amongst the most innovatory texts (and illustrations) of their time.

== Biography ==
Chernikov was born to a poor &amp;lt;!-- Jewish --&amp;gt; family, one of 11 children. After studying at the college of art in [[Odessa]], he moved in 1914 to [[Petrograd]] (St. Petersburg) and joined the Architecture faculty of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in 1916, where he later studied under [[Leon Benois]]. Greatly interested in [[Russian Futurism|futurist]] movements, including [[Constructivist architecture|constructivism]], and the [[suprematism]] of [[Malevich]] (with whom he was acquainted), he set out his ideas in a series of books in the late 1920s and early 1930s, including:
* The Art of Graphic Representation (1927)
* Fundamentals of Contemporary Architecture (1930)
* The Construction of Architectural and Machine Forms (1931)
* 101 Architectural Fantasies (1933)

The latter, a very fine example of colour printing, was perhaps the last avant-garde art book to be published in Russia during the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]ist era. Its remarkable designs uncannily predict the architecture of the later 20th century. However his unusual ideas meant that Chernikhov was distrusted by the regime. Although he continued work as a teacher and held a number of one-man shows, few of his designs were built and very few appear to have survived. Amongst the latter is the tower of the &amp;apos;Red Carnation&amp;apos; factory in St. Petersburg.

Chernikhov also produced a number of richly designed architectural fantasies of historic architecture, which were never exhibited in his lifetime. A book on &amp;apos;The Construction of Letter Forms&amp;apos; containing some of his typographical designs, was published after his death, in 1959.

Chernikhov produced some 17,000 drawings and projects and was dubbed the Soviet Piranesi.&amp;lt;ref name=Eaton&amp;gt; Mercatorfonds, Antwerp and Eaton, Ruth. 2001. Ideal Cities: Utopianism and the (Un)Built Environment. Page193-194. ISBN 90-6153-475-5.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; On 8 August 2006, it was announced that some hundreds of Chernikhov&amp;apos;s drawings, with an estimated value of $1,300,000, had gone missing from the Russian State Archives. Some 274 have been recovered, in Russia and abroad.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;BBC News. 8 August 2006. Valuable Russian drawings stolen.
