&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yang Zuo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a military general serving under the warlord [[Gongsun Yuan]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period of [[History of China|Chinese history]]. In 238, he led a front of troops along with [[Bei Yan]] during [[Sima Yi]]&amp;apos;s [[Sima Yi&amp;apos;s Liaodong campaign|Liaodong campaign]] against Gongsun. Yang then engaged Sima during a protracted battle, but ended up being lured out by Sima and defeated. He then escaped into Xiangping (襄平), Gongsun&amp;apos;s headquarters, and surrendered to Sima when the city was under siege.
