{{Muhammad}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yā Muḥammad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Arabic]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;يا محمد&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), or Ya Rasullallah (Sallallaho Alaihi Wassalam) is an expression used by the Muslims, which means &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oh Muhammad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;.

==Definition==
The phrase means &amp;quot;O [name]&amp;quot;. Literally, the word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yā&amp;apos;&amp;apos; means O (a [[vocative]], signifying a direct address to a person).  It is a common prefix used by Arabs to call each other. Someone named Zaid will be addressed in Arabic as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yā Zaid&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Use==

===Use in Various Parts of the World===
Muslims regularly uses this phrase or Ya Rasullallah (Sallallaho Alaihi Wassalam) to call the Prophet in distress.They take this from the Quran ,Hadees and from the usage of companions of Prophet of Islam.

===Use to Call a stranger===
In [[Saudi Arabia]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yā Muḥammad&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is used to address a stranger in order to begin a conversation. It is considered one of the polite and respectful ways to address a stranger, as Muhammad is considered as the most respectful name anyone can be called, hence its popularity among Muslims worldwide.

===Request for strength===
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ya Ali&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is mostly used as a request for strength by the [[Shia]] and [[Shia]] in the phrase &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ya Ali Madad&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;یا علی مدد&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ali, help!&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). He is established as the strongest bravest chivalrous warrior that fought with the prophet, and he is also an [[Imamah (Shi&amp;apos;a doctrine)|Imam]] by Shia School of thought, and he is the [[Rashidun|Final Caliph]] by Sunni School of thought among Muslims. There is a tradition of using these phrases as slogans in religious gatherings meant to increase one&amp;apos;s level of morale and also in situations demanding religious passion. For example, two or more people having to lift a weight and would say &amp;apos;&amp;apos;یا علی مدد&amp;apos;&amp;apos; aloud (mostly in the [[subcontinent]]).

===Remembrance of Muharram===
During the [[Remembrance of Muharram]], spontaneous slogans of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ya Hussain&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ya ‘Ali&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ya Rasulul-Lah&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Messenger of God!&amp;quot; are very common. On such occasions, the slogans are mostly demonstrations of strong support.

===Pilgrimage===
Muslims visiting the grave of Muhammad recite &amp;apos;&amp;apos;As-salatu as-salamu alayka, Ya Rasulul-Lah&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Greetings and peace be upon you, O Messenger of God&amp;quot;. Muslims use similar kinds of greetings while visiting graves and shrines of other holy personalities.
