&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yashpal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (December 3, 1903–December 26, 1976) was a noted Hindi author who wrote books like &amp;apos;&amp;apos;झूटा सच Jhutha Sach (The False Truth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1958–1960). He won the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] for his novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Meri Teri Uski Baat&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1976.&amp;lt;ref name=sahitya&amp;gt;[http://www.sahitya-akademi.gov.in/old_version/awa10306.htm#hindi Hindi Sahitya Akademi Awards 1955-2007] [[Sahitya Akademi]] Official website.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He served as an editor of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Viplav]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for many years.

His works have been translated into many languages.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=Course in Advanced Hindi |author= Sheela Verma, l Varm |year=1997|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=81-208-1470-3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TgdOmgN3F5wC&amp;amp;pg=PA2&amp;amp;dq=Yashpal+-inauthor:Bajaj+-inauthor:Yashpal&amp;amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;amp;output=html}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Yashpal was a revolutionary who fought for India&amp;apos;s freedom and he was arrested when he was twenty-eight years old. He was tried and sentenced to fourteen years of hard labour.

==Centenary celebrations==
In the year 2003-2004, events to celebrate Yashpal’s birth centenary were held across the length and the breadth of nation with an enthusiasm not seen except at the time of Prem Chand’s birth centenary celebrations: from national seminars organized by the Sahitya Akademi (India’s National Academy of Letters) at Shimla and at Kolkata, and by the Kerala Sahitya Akademi at Cochin, to local affairs in small towns in the Hindi-speaking heartland of India. These events were marked by a forceful and unequivocal acknowledgment of Yashpal being the towering figure in the post-Prem Chand era, as well as of the author’s importance and his impact on Hindi literature and on the successive generations of young writers. The Government of India issued a commemorative Yashpal Centenary postage stamp.
