&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yanka Maur&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Lang-be|Я́нка Маўр}}; {{Lang-lv|Janka Maurs}}; {{Lang-ru|Я́нка Мавр}}; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yanka Mavr&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), (May 11, 1883 - August 3, 1971) was a famous [[Belarus]]ian writer. Yanka Maur was actually his pseudonym, while his real name was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ivan Mikhailavich Fiodarau&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Belarusian: Іва́н Міха́йлавіч Фёдараў).  His son, [[Fiodar Fiodaraŭ]], was a famous Belarusian physicist.

He was born in [[Liepāja]], [[Courland]] and grew up in the Belarusian village Lebianishki, which is now in [[Lithuania]]. He graduated from vocational school in [[Kaunas]], then entered a pedagogical school in 1899, but was thrown out for being a member of an underground revolutionary club. Nevertheless in 1903 he passed all the exams as a non-resident student and became a high school teacher. In 1906 took part in the underground meeting of the Belarusian teachers, organized by the famous Belarusian writer [[Yakub Kolas]]. After that he was arrested and could not work as a teacher anymore. He could teach again only in 1911, becoming a geography and history teacher in a private school in [[Minsk]].

He was working in many different literary genres: satirical, historical, literature for kids. He is credited with starting the [[science fiction]] tradition in the modern [[Belarus]]ian literature.

His biggest novel is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Amok&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but his best-selling and perhaps most known book was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Palesse]] Robinsons&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Besides writing, he also translated stories into [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] from many foreign authors, including [[Jules Verne]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Mark Twain]], and others.
