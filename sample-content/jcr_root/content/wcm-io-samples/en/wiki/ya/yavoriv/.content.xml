&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yavoriv&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-uk|Яворів}}; {{lang-pl|Jaworów}}) is a [[city]] located in the [[Lviv Oblast]] ([[Oblast|province]]) of western [[Ukraine]]. It is the [[Capital city|administrative center]] of the [[Yavoriv Raion]] and rests approximately 50&amp;amp;nbsp;km west of the oblast capital, [[Lviv]].

The current estimated population is around 13,500 (as of 2001).

Not far from it is the watering-place of Shklo with sulphur springs. The town was first mentioned in written documents in 1376, when it belonged to the Duke of [[Opava]] and [[Raciborz]], Waclaw. It received [[Magdeburg rights]] in 1569, from King [[Zygmunt III August]]. It was a favorite residence of king [[John III Sobieski]], who there received the congratulations from the Pope on his [[Battle of Vienna|success against the Turks at Vienna]] (1683).

Until the [[Partitions of Poland]], Yavoriv, or Jaworow, was an important center of commerce, located along main merchant route from [[Jaroslaw]] to [[Lwow]]. In 1772 it was annexed by the [[Habsburg Empire]], as part of Austrian [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], where it remained until late 1918. In Galicia, it was the seat of a county, with the population of almost 11,000 (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians, Czechs).

In the immediate post-[[World War One]] period, the area of Jaworow witnessed Polish - Ukrainian fighting (see [[Polish-Ukrainian War]]). Here in 1919, authorities of the [[West Ukrainian People&amp;apos;s Republic]] murdered 17 Polish prisoners, whom they accused of plotting against the government. After the war, the town became part of the [[Second Polish Republic]], where it remained until the September 1939 [[Invasion of Poland]].

Among notable people born here are [[Wladyslaw Langner]] (General of the [[Polish Army]]), Stanislaw Nowakowski ([[List of Presidents of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association|president of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association]]), and mathematician [[Wawrzyniec Zmurko]].
