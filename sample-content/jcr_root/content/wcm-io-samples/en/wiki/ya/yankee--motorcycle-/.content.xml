The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yankee motorcycle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[motorcycle]] which  was produced in [[Schenectady, New York]] by the Yankee Motor Company in the 1970s. This company was started by John Taylor, a long-time resident of that area.

The motorcycle used an air-cooled [[two-stroke]] engine, designed by [[Eduard GirÃ³]] that was produced by the [[Ossa_(motorcycle)|Ossa]] firm in [[Barcelona, Spain]]. The engine was a unique combination of two Ossa cylinders, that produced a twin-cylinder engine of near 500 cc capacity. The Yankee frame, designed with help from [[Dick Mann]], and running gear were produced in the US, and the entire motorcycle was assembled in the Yankee plant on Campbell Avenue in Schenectady.
