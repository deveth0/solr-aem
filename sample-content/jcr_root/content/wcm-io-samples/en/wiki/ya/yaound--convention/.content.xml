        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yaoundé Convention&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a convention signed in the city of [[Yaoundé]], [[Cameroon]] between the [[European Community|EC]] and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ASMM&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (African States, [[Madagascar]] and [[Mauritius]]).

==The First Convention (1964-1969)==
The first association agreement between the EC and the 18 African ex-colonies that had recently gained independence, was signed in Yaoundé on 20 July 1963 and entered into force on 1 June 1964. It was mainly based on the previous treaty between the EC and its overseas territories and had a validity period of 5 years.

==The Second Convention (1971-1975)==
After the first treaty expired, a new one was signed on 29 July 1969 and entered into force on 1 January 1971, with Madagascar and Mauritius becoming the 19th African state to take part in the convention. There was a tight link between the ASMM and the East African countries of [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]] so the EC wanted the [[Arusha Agreement]] with the three to enter into force on the same date as the Second Yaoundé Convention. Both agreements ended and constituted the basis for the broader [[Lomé Convention]] of 1975.
