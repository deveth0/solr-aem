[[File:Yabba Statue SCG 1.JPG|thumb|Statue of Yabba at the Sydney Cricket Ground]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stephen Harold Gascoigne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, better known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yabba&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (19 March 1878 - 8 January 1942) was an [[Australian]] sports fan, remembered as a [[heckler]] at [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] [[cricket]] and [[rugby league]] games in the early part of the 20th century. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yabba&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was known for his knowledgeable witticisms shouted loudly from &amp;quot;The Hill&amp;quot;, a grassy general admissions area of the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]]. In Yabba&amp;apos;s era, cricket matches were watched like tennis matches, and spectators at the SCG were much quieter than today. This is the reason Yabba&amp;apos;s comments were so clearly heard by players and other spectators.

&amp;quot;The Hill&amp;quot; area was replaced with seating in the early 1990s. The new area was then formally named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yabba&amp;apos;s Hill&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in honour of his colourful comments, several of which have passed into cricketing folklore.  In 2007 the [[Doug Walters]] Stand and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yabba&amp;apos;s Hill&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were demolished to make way for the new [[Victor Trumper]] Stand. On 7 December 2008 a bronze statue of Yabba, sculpted by [[Cathy Weiszmann]], was unveiled at the Sydney Cricket Ground in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Hill&amp;apos;&amp;apos; area of the new stand. It depicts Yabba in a characteristic pose, one hand acting as a megaphone, in the act of delivering one of his famous interjections. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite news

Yabba was portrayed by [[Paul Chubb]] in the 1984 mini-series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bodyline&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Insults==
[[File:Yabba Statue SCG 2.JPG|thumb|Yabba&amp;apos;s view across the pitch of the Sydney Cricket Ground]]
Some of Yabba&amp;apos;s best remembered insults include:

* &amp;quot;I wish you were a statue and I were a pigeon.&amp;quot;
* Telling a fly-swatting English cricket captain, [[Douglas Jardine]], to &amp;quot;Leave our flies alone, Jardine. They&amp;apos;re the only friends you&amp;apos;ve got here.&amp;quot;
* &amp;quot;Send &amp;apos;im down a piano, see if &amp;apos;e can play that!&amp;quot;
* &amp;quot;Oh for a strong arm and a walking stick!&amp;quot; (at bad bowling; leg spinner [[Arthur Mailey]], a regular victim of this one, quotes it several times in his book 10 for 66 and All That)
* &amp;quot;Those are the only balls you&amp;apos;ve touched all day!&amp;quot; (To an English batsman adjusting his [[box (cricket)|box]] in between overs).
* &amp;quot;Put a penny in him, George, he&amp;apos;s stopped registering&amp;quot; (To an umpire who read [[gas meter]]s and emptied the cash boxes for a living, when a batsman at the crease was scoring slowly)
* &amp;quot;Your length&amp;apos;s lousy but you bowl a good width!&amp;quot; (To an opposition bowler)
