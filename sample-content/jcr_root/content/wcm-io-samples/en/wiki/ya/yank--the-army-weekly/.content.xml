&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yank, the Army Weekly&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a weekly magazine published by the [[United States military]] during [[World War II]]. The idea for the magazine came from [[Egbert White]], who had worked on [[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]] during World War I. He proposed the idea to the Army in early 1942, and accepted a commission as Lieutenant Colonel. White was the overall commander, Major [[Franklin S. Forsberg]] was the business manager and Major [[Hartzell Spence]] was the first editor.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |last= McGurn|first= Barrett |title= Yank the Army Weekly: Reporting the Greatest Generation|publisher= Fulcrum Publishing |year= 2004  |isbn= 1-55591-296-6}} page 65&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; White was removed from the Yank staff because of disagreements about articles which had appeared.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal |last=White |first=Egbert|journal=Journal of Educational Sociology|volume=19|number=4|title=A Free Press in a Citizen&amp;apos;s Army |pages=236â€“248 |jstor=2263264}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Soon afterward, Spence was also assigned to other duties and Joe McCarthy became the editor.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;McGurn p 87-89&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The first issue was published with the cover date of June 17, 1942.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The magazine was written by [[enlisted rank]] soldiers only and was made available to the soldiers, sailors, and airmen serving overseas. It was published at facilities around the world&amp;amp;mdash;British, Mediterranean, Continental, and Western Pacific&amp;amp;mdash;for a total of 21 editions in 17 countries. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yank&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the most widely read magazine in the history of the U.S. military, achieving a worldwide circulation of more than 2.6 million. Each issue was priced from five cents to 10 cents because it was felt that if soldiers paid, they would have a higher regard for the publication. Each issue was edited in [[New York City]] and then shipped for printing around the world where staff editors added local stories. The last issue was published in December 1945. [[Scott Corbett]] (later known as a writer of novels for children) served as the last editor.

Sketch artists such as Robert Greenhalgh and Howard Brodie worked on the magazine, which also featured the &amp;quot;[[G.I. Joe (comics)|G.I. Joe]]&amp;quot; cartoons by [[Dave Breger]] and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sad Sack]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; cartoons by [[George Baker (cartoonist)|Sgt. George Baker]]. Artist and author [[Jack Coggins]] spent over two years with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yank&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, first in New York, then in London, producing illustrations and articles in more than 24 issues.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} [[John Bushemi]] was a photographer, who photographed the [[Pacific War]] and provided covers for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yank&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;WDL&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/453/ |title = Operations Against the Japanese on Arundel and Sagekarsa Islands |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1943 |accessdate = 2013-06-02 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

One of the most popular &amp;quot;morale boosters&amp;quot; for the men in the armed forces was the inclusion of a [[pin-up girl]] in each issue who was usually clad either in a bathing suit or some form of seductive attire. The pin-up girls included stage and screen stars.
