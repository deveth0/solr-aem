&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Béla Balázs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-hu|ˈbeːlɒ ˈbɒlaːʒ|lang}}; 4 August 1884, [[Szeged]] – 17 May 1949, [[Budapest]]), born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herbert Bauer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-[[Jew]]ish [[film criticism|film critic]], [[aesthetics|aesthete]], [[writer]] and [[poet]].

==Career==
Balázs was the son of German-born parents, adopting his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;nom de plume&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in newspaper articles written before his 1902 move to Budapest, where he studied Hungarian and German at the Eötvös Collegium.

Balázs was a moving force in the [[Sonntagskreis]] or Sunday Circle, the intellectual discussion group which he founded in the autumn of 1915 together with Lajos Fülep, [[Arnold Hauser]], [[György Lukács]] and [[Karl Mannheim|Károly (Karl) Mannheim]]. Meetings were held at his flat on Sunday afternoons; already in December 1915 Balázs wrote in his diary of the success of the group.&amp;lt;ref name=gluck&amp;gt;Mary Gluck (1985) [http://books.google.it/books?id=TUdmFkDoIGUC&amp;amp;pg=PA15 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Georg Lukács and His Generation, 1900-1918&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. pp. 14–16&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He is perhaps best remembered as the librettist of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bluebeard&amp;apos;s Castle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which he originally wrote for his roommate [[Zoltán Kodály]], who in turn introduced him to the eventual composer of the opera, [[Béla Bartók]]. This collaboration continued with the scenario for the ballet &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Wooden Prince]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The collapse of the short-lived [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] under [[Béla Kun]] in 1919 began a long period of exile in Vienna and Germany and, from 1933 until 1945, the Soviet Union. [[Georg Lukács|György Lukács]], a close friend during their youth, became a bitter enemy during the ordeal of the [[Great Purge|Stalinist purges]].

In Vienna he became a prolific writer of film reviews. His first book on film, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Der Sichtbare Mensch&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Visible Man&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (1924), helped found the [[Germany|German]] &amp;quot;film as a language&amp;quot; theory, which also exerted an influence on [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]. A popular consultant, he wrote the screenplay for [[G. W. Pabst]]&amp;apos;s film of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Threepenny Opera (1931 film)|Die Dreigroschenoper]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1931), which became the object of a scandal and lawsuit by [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] (who admitted to not reading the script) during production.

Later, he co-wrote (with [[Carl Mayer]]) and helped [[Leni Riefenstahl]] direct the film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Das Blaue Licht]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[1932 in film|1932]]). Riefenstahl later removed his and Mayer&amp;apos;s name from the credits because they were Jewish.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/LitWiss/MedienWiss/Forsch/Telaviv/Riefenstahl-englisch.html Hanno Loewy: &amp;quot;Balazs&amp;apos; and Leni Riefenstahl&amp;apos;s The blue Light. A martyr&amp;apos;s story&amp;quot;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; One of his best known films is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Somewhere in Europe]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;It Happened in Europe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1947), directed by [[Géza von Radványi]]).

His last years were marked by petty vexations at home and ever increasing recognition in the German speaking world. In 1949, he received the most distinguished prize in [[Hungary]], the [[Kossuth Prize]]. Also in 1949, he finished &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theory of the Film&amp;apos;&amp;apos; published posthumously in English (London: Denis Dobson, 1952). In 1958, the Béla Balázs Prize was founded and named for him as an award to recognize achievements in  [[cinematography]].
