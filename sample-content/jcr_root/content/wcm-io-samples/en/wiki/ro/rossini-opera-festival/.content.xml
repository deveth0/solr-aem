        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rossini Opera Festival&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (frequently referred to among musicians as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pesaro Festival&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and usually nicknamed just &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ROF&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is an [[opera festival]] held in August of each year in [[Pesaro]], [[Italy]], the birthplace of the [[opera]] composer [[Gioachino Rossini]].

Performances are given in the 850-seat theatre built in 1818, the [[Teatro Rossini (Pesaro)|Teatro Rossini]] and, since 1988, the modified &amp;quot;Palasport&amp;quot; sports arena which holds 1,500.  Since 2000 another venue, the [[Teatro Sperimentale]] (Experimental Theatre), has offered the opportunity to present smaller-scale or minor works by contemporaries of Rossini such as [[Luigi Mosca|Mosca]], [[Generali]], and [[Coccia]].

==Rossini&amp;apos;s music in Pesaro==
Prior to the establishment of the Festival, it was not uncommon to see productions of Rossini&amp;apos;s music taking place to mark occasions in his life and death.  Thus, in 1868 when the composer died in Paris, his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Stabat Mater (Rossini)]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was performed along with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Semiramide]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Otello (Rossini)|Otello]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The first centennial of Rossini&amp;apos;s birth in 1892 saw &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[L&amp;apos;occasione fa il ladro]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the twentieth-century seasons saw many Rossini operas including many quite obscure ones.

==The Festival established in 1980==
The Festival was established in 1980 with the aim of making the world more aware of Rossini&amp;apos;s neglected operas and presenting all of them in collaboration with the [[G. Ricordi &amp;amp; Co.]] music publishing house, which published their critical editions.  Of the approximately three dozen operas written, only a handful are regularly presented.

On 13 August 1993, the Italian parliament unanimously approved the Special Law N. 319 &amp;quot;Regulations in support of the Rossini Opera Festival&amp;quot;, which recognizes the Pesaro Festival&amp;apos;s achievements in the reviving of Rossini&amp;apos;s operas as entitled to be included among the state-supervised works of restoration of the national artistic heritage. The ensuing grant (of which parliament has recently approved the continuation) is financed from the funds of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Beni Culturali&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The Rossini Festival has seen many of Rossini&amp;apos;s lesser-known works revived, some of which have since entered the [[List of famous operas|standard operatic repertoire]].

From the beginning, the Festival attracted some major singers including [[Marilyn Horne]], [[Montserrat Caballé]], [[Ruggero Raimondi]] and [[Juan Diego Flórez]].  Based on press reports, some productions have been extremely controversial.
