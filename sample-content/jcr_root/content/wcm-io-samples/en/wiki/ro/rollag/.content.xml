&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rollag&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in [[Buskerud]] [[Counties of Norway|county]], [[Norway]].  It is part of the [[Districts of Norway|traditional region]] of [[Numedal]].  The municipality of Rollag was established on 1 January 1838 (see [[formannskapsdistrikt]]). [[Nore og Uvdal]] was separated from Rollag in 1858.

The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Rollag, although the most populated area in the municipality is [[Veggli]].  Rollag is bordered in the north by Nore og Uvdal, in the east by [[Sigdal]], in the south by [[Flesberg]], and in the west by [[Tinn]] ([[Telemark]] county).

==General information==
===Name===
The municipality (originally the [[parish]]) is named after the old &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rollag&amp;apos;&amp;apos; farm ([[Old Norse]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Roll(u)lag&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), since the first church was built here. The first element is probably (the [[genitive case]] of) a river name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rolla&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (now called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Troelva&amp;apos;&amp;apos; river) and the last element is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;lag&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which means &amp;quot;[[fishing]] place&amp;quot;. The meaning of the river name is unknown (maybe &amp;quot;the shivering&amp;quot;).

===Coat-of-arms===
The [[Coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] is from modern times.  They were granted in 1993.  The arms show two gold-colored lines on a red background.  The lines represent an old warning [[cairn]] made of timber.

==Geography==
The municipality lies in the heart of the [[Numedal]] [[Districts of Norway|traditional region]] and [[valley]], the westernmost valley in southeastern Norway. The river &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Numedalslågen]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; flows through Rollag and into the [[Ytre Oslofjord]] at [[Larvik]].

In the northwest of the Rollag lie the [[Vegglifjell mountains]], which are an entryway into the [[Hardangervidda]]. The municipality&amp;apos;s highest point is Storegrønut at {{convert|1289|m|ft}} located in the Vegglifjell mountains.

==Rollag stave church==
*The [[Rollag stave church]] (built around 1150-1200) is located a few kilometres north of the centre of Rollag. It was extended and windows were added in 1652. A new [[Apse]] was added in 1666. The [[transept]] was constructed in 1697-1698. A gallery was added in 1702. The [[sacristy]] was built in 1739. A [[Baroque]] pulpit was added in 1763.
