&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Romanzo d&amp;apos;appendìce&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Italian for [[Feuilleton]]) was a popular genre in [[literature]], which originated in [[England]] and [[France]], in the second half of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th.

This literary genre is characterised by the existence of many and often recurring characters, and by many [[cliffhanger]]s at the end of a chapter, to ensure sales of the next episode. This is a clear case of form influencing [[Content (media and publishing)|content]]: these [[novel]]s were [[Serial (literature)|published in episodes]] in [[newspapers]] and could in a certain sense be compared to modern [[soap opera]]. [[Ponson du Terrail]], [[Eugene Sue]], [[Maurice Leblanc]], [[Gustave Le Rouge]] and [[Michel Zévaco]] were among the numerous authors which contributed to the genre.

[[Feuilleton]] is used in current language to indicate a quite improbable story.
