Rock shelters form because a [[Rock (geology)|rock]] stratum such as sandstone that is resistant to [[erosion]] and [[weathering]] has formed a cliff or bluff, but a softer stratum, more subject to erosion and weathering, lies just below the resistant stratum, and thus undercuts the cliff.

Many rock shelters are found under [[waterfalls]].

Rock shelters are often important [[archaeology|archaeologically]]. Because rock shelters form natural shelters from the weather, prehistoric humans often used them as living-places, and left behind debris, tools, and other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. In mountainous areas the shelters can also be important for [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]]. In western [[Connecticut]] and eastern [[New York]], many rock shelters are known by the [[colloquialism]] &amp;quot;leatherman caves&amp;quot;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.ctmuseumquest.com/?page_id=6343 CT Museum: Leatherman Caves]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; as they were inhabited by the [[Leatherman (vagabond)|Leatherman]] over three decades in the late 19th century.

In arid areas, [[wind]] erosion (eolian erosion) can be an important factor in rockhouse formation. In most humid areas, the most important factor in rockhouse formation is [[frost weathering|frost spalling]], where the softer, more porous rock underneath is pushed off, tiny pieces at a time, by frost expansion from water frozen in the pores. Erosion from moving water is seldom a significant factor.

The [[Minuartia cumberlandensis|Cumberland stitchwort]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Minuartia cumberlandensis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is an endangered species of plant which is found only in rock shelters in Kentucky and Tennessee.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.centerforplantconservation.org/collection/cpc_viewprofile.asp?CPCNum=13821 Center for Plant Conservation]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
