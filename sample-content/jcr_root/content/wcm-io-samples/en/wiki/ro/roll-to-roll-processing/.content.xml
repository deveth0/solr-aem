In the field of electronic devices, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Roll-to-roll processing&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;web processing&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;reel-to-reel processing&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;R2R&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is the process of creating electronic devices on a roll of [[flexible plastic]] or metal [[Foil (chemistry)|foil]]. In other fields predating this use, it can refer to any process of applying coatings, [[Roll-to-roll printing|printing]], or performing other processes starting with a roll of a flexible material and re-reeling after the process to create an output roll. These processes can be grouped together under the general term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[converting]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Once the rolls of material have been coated, laminated or printed they are normally slit to their finished size on a [[slitter]] rewinder.

== R2R in electronic devices ==
Large [[Integrated circuit|circuit]]s made with [[thin-film transistor]]s and other devices can be easily [[pattern]]ed onto these large substrates, which can be up to a few metres wide and 50&amp;amp;nbsp;km long.  Some of the devices can be patterned directly, much like an [[inkjet printer]] deposits ink.  For most [[semiconductor]]s, however, the devices must be patterned using [[photolithography]] techniques.

Roll-to-roll processing is a technology that is still in development.  If [[semiconductor device]]s can be fabricated in this way on large substrates, many devices could be fabricated at a fraction of the cost of traditional semiconductor manufacturing methods.  Most notable would be [[solar cell]]s, which are still prohibitively expensive for most markets due to the high cost per unit area of traditional bulk ([[Monocrystalline silicon|mono-]] or [[Polycrystalline silicon|polycrystalline]]) silicon manufacturing.  Other applications could arise which take advantage of the flexible nature of the substrates, such as electronics embedded into clothing, large-area flexible displays, and roll-up portable displays.

=== Thin-film cells ===
A crucial issue for a roll-to-roll thin-film cell production system is the [[Deposition (physics)|deposition]] rate of the [[microcrystalline]] layer, and this can be tackled using four approaches:&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Wayback |url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/nn/nn_rt/nn_rt_pv/article_1109_en.htm#5 |date=20060618 |title=PV projects in FP6}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
*very high frequency  plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition ([[VHF]]-[[PECVD]])
*microwave ([[Microwave|MW]])-PECVD
*hot wire [[chemical vapour deposition]] ([[hot wire|hot-wire CVD]]).
*the use of [[ultrasonic nozzle]]s in an in-line process
