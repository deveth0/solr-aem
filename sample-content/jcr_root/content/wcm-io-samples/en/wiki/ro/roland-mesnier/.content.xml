&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Roland Mesnier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born July 8 1944) is a [[France|French]]-[[United States of America|American]] [[pastry chef]] and culinary writer. His creations during his twenty five years as [[White House Executive Pastry Chef|Executive Pastry Chef]] (1979-2004)  at the [[White House]] have earned him the reputation of a creative [[genius]].

==Early life==
Mesnier was born into a family of nine children in the village of [[Boner, Doubs|Bonnay]], France. He first became interested in becoming a chef when he visited his brother&amp;apos;s pastry shop in a nearby city and was delighted by the smell of fresh fruit in the kitchen. His mother secured an [[apprentice]]ship for him when he was fourteen at a pastry shop in [[Besançon]]. He would work from 6am to 8pm six days a week and in exchange received 300 francs a month, plus room and board, in addition to cooking lessons.

Like most young apprentices, Mesnier was only given menial tasks, such as grocery shopping at first to see if he were truly interested in learning the profession. Mesnier stayed on and eventually was taught how to make [[cake]]s, [[croissant]]s, and [[brioche]]. He also was first exposed to [[puff pastry]] and  [[modeling chocolate|chocolate molding]] which laid the groundwork for his future specialties. At 17 he passed his apprenticeship exam and began to look for work that would both enhance his skills and his reputation.

Eventually he found his way to [[Paris]], working in a restaurant and pastry shop near the [[Palais Garnier|Opéra Garnier]]. He soon mastered all there was to learn in Paris and on the advice his employer he went to [[West Germany]] where techniques were more advanced. Mesnier lived in [[Hamburg]] and [[Hanover]] and learned how to make [[cake]]s, [[cookie]]s, [[fondant]]s, and [[marzipan]] modeling as well as mastering the [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]] languages.
