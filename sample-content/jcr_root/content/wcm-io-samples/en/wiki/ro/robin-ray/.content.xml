==Career==
The son of comedian [[Ted Ray (comedian)|Ted Ray]], he was educated at [[Highgate School]] and the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], first appearing as a professional actor in a London production of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Changeling (play)|The Changeling]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1960,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Gifford&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Denis Gifford [http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-robin-ray-1188259.html Obituary: Robin Ray,] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Independent&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 30 November 1998&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; before taking up teaching drama at [[RADA]]. In 1966, Ray resigned his post at RADA, to pursue a career in broadcasting.

From 1965 he was the chairman of the new [[BBC]] show &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Call My Bluff (UK game show)|Call My Bluff]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and he was a popular regular panel member on the BBC classical music series, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Face The Music (television)|Face the Music]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,  which began in 1966. Ray was able to recognise pieces of piano music and name not only the piece and the composer but also the opus number, particularly the [[Köchel catalogue|Köchel]] or &amp;quot;K&amp;quot; number of pieces by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. His cheerful manner and boyish good looks made him a great favourite with viewers; he was asked to present other quiz programmes, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Movie Quiz]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Film Buff of the Year]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which was ran from 1985 to 1992.

The children&amp;apos;s television programme &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sounds Exciting]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, broadcast in 1968, was a musical education series culminating in a final &amp;quot;whodunit&amp;quot; called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dead in Tune]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; with Robin Ray&amp;apos;s original story set to the music of Herbert Chappell performed by a chamber group of players from the [[Leicestershire Schools Symphony Orchestra]]. Two years later [[Argo Records (UK)|Argo]] recorded the piece using an ensemble of 45 LSSO players conducted by [[Herbert Chappell]]. This LP also included a new commission, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[George and the Dragonfly]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, with John Kershaw’s words set to the music of Herbert Chappell and narrated by Robin Ray, John Kershaw and Susan Stranks (Robin Ray&amp;apos;s wife).

He wrote the musical &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cafe Puccini&amp;apos;&amp;apos; at the age of 45, which opened at the [[Wyndham&amp;apos;s Theatre]] in 1986 with musical director [[William Blezard]].&amp;lt;ref name = &amp;quot;RRay&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news|title =&amp;quot;Broadcaster Robin Ray dies&amp;quot;, BBC Obituary but with wrong date of production |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/224123.stm|accessdate = 2009-02-14 | date=29 November 1998 | work=BBC News}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In the early 1980s he had presented a programme called &amp;quot;Robin Ray&amp;apos;s Record Review&amp;quot; on [[Capital Radio]].

In the early 1990s, he was one of the first executives hired by the start-up commercial [[European classical music|classical music]] radio station, [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]], with which he remained associated from 1991 to 1997. He drew up a list of 50,000 pieces of classical music and rating them for popular appeal, which was the basis for the Classic FM playlist. This list proved to be extremely attractive to similar popular classical music radio stations in other countries and there was a legal dispute between Ray and Classic FM, which Ray won in 1998, as to who was entitled to the [[copyright]] in the playlist and ratings (Robin Ray v Classic FM Plc [1998] FSR 622).
