        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Robert D. Van Valin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born February 1, 1952) is an American linguist and the principal author behind the development of [[role and reference grammar|Role and Reference Grammar]], a [[Functional linguistics|functional theory of grammar]] encompassing [[syntax]], [[semantics]] and discourse [[pragmatics]]. Role and Reference Grammar is related to other functional theories, like S. Dik&amp;apos;s [[functional grammar|Functional Grammar]], and also to the [[cognitive linguistics]] field pioneered by [[Ronald Langacker]]. His 1997 monograph &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Syntax: structure, meaning and function&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an attempt to provide a method for syntactic analysis which is just as relevant for languages like [[Dyirbal]] and [[Lakota language|Lakhota]] as it is for more commonly studied [[Indo-European languages]].

Instead of positing a rich innate and universal syntactic structure (see [[Universal Grammar]]), Van Valin suggests that the only truly universal parts of a sentence are its nucleus, generally a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicating]] element such as a verb or adjective, and the arguments, normally [[noun phrase]]s, that the nucleus requires. Van Valin also departs from [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] syntactic theory by denying the universality of the [[verb phrase]].

He is a Professor at the [[Heinrich Heine University of DÃ¼sseldorf]] and the [[University at Buffalo]].
