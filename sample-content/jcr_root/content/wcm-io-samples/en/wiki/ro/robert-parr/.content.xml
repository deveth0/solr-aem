&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Robert Ghormley Parr&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born September 22, 1921 in [[Chicago]]) is a [[theoretical chemistry|theoretical chemist]].  He is a chemistry professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

==Career==
Parr received an A. B. [[academic degree|degree]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;magna cum laude&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from [[Brown University]] in 1942, and then entered the [[University of Minnesota]], receiving a Ph. D. in [[physical chemistry]] in 1947. He joined the faculty at Minnesota upon receiving his Ph. D. and remained there one year. In 1948 he moved to the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] (now [[Carnegie Mellon University]]) in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], becoming a full professor in 1957. In 1962 he moved to [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and in 1974 to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he received appointment to an endowed professorship in 1990 and where he now teaches.

==Achievements and awards==
Working with [[DuPont]] chemist [[Rudolph Pariser]], Parr developed a method of computing approximate [[molecular orbital]]s for [[pi electron]] systems, published in 1953. Since an identical procedure was derived by [[John Pople|John A. Pople]] the same year, it is generally referred to as the [[Pariser-Parr-Pople method]] or PPP method. The PPP method differed from existing structural chemistry thinking (which advocated &amp;apos;&amp;apos;maximum overlap principle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) by advancing the concept of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zero differential overlap approximation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

By 1978 Parr had realized that [[Density Functional Theory]] (DFT) would be extremely useful in quantitative calculations of chemical and biological systems, especially those with high molecular weights.  In 1988 Parr, [[Weitao Yang]] and Chengteh Lee produced an improved DFT method which could approximate the correlation energy of systems.  The LYP functional theory is now one of the most-often cited papers in the chemical literature.

In 1963 Parr published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quantum Theory of Molecular Electronic Structure&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, one of the first books to apply quantum theory to chemical systems.

In 1989 he and Yang published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Density Functional Theory of Atoms and Molecules&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, now considered the basic textbook on DFT.

==Awards and honors==

*1967 - Co-founded (with 4 others) the [[International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science]]
*1994 - Winner of [[American Chemical Society]]&amp;apos;s [[Irving Langmuir Award]] in Chemical Physics
