&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rocky Super Action Boxing&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the first licensed [[video game]] based on the [[Rocky (film series)|popular &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rocky&amp;apos;&amp;apos; film series]]. The game is based on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Rocky III]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and was designed by [[Coleco]]. In the game, the player can play as either [[Clubber Lang]] or [[Rocky Balboa (character)|Rocky Balboa]] in the game, either against the computer in a one player game, or against each other in a &amp;quot;Head to Head&amp;quot; two player mode.  There is also a &amp;quot;Demo&amp;quot; mode if you just want to watch Rocky and Clubber fight.

Since Rocky Super Action Boxing is one of the later ColecoVision titles released, it does feature a pause feature for the game.

==Gameplay==

Each boxing match that is played consists of, according on the skill level chosen, two, five, ten, or fifteen rounds each lasting a minute each.  During gameplay, the player&amp;apos;s movement is restricted to three positions or &amp;quot;lanes&amp;quot; vertically, and from each player&amp;apos;s side of the ring to the front of their opponent horizontally.

The 4 button controller allows for (independantly) offensive hits to the body or head, defensive blocking for the head and body, and ducking.

Points are scored in the game by hitting the opponent&amp;apos;s guard (1 point), or with a punch connecting with the opponent&amp;apos;s head or body (2 points for either hit).

Victory can be achieved in two ways, either by knockout, or by point count if the fight goes all the way to the end.
