&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rockbank&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a township and rural locality in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], 29&amp;amp;nbsp;km west of Melbourne&amp;apos;s [[Melbourne City Centre|Central Business District]]. Its [[Local government areas of Victoria|local government area]] is the [[Shire of Melton]]. At the [[Census in Australia#2011|2011 Census]], Rockbank had a population of 1,349.

Rockbank Post Office opened on 1 January 1862.&amp;lt;ref name = &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite web
  | last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&amp;amp;country= | accessdate = 11 April 2008

The area lies east of the township of [[Melton, Victoria|Melton]] and west of the suburb of [[Deer Park, Victoria|Deer Park]]. The land contains many large [[volcano|volcanic]] rocks making it poor for cultivating crops. The rocks have been used to build walls between paddocks - characteristic of the area west of Melbourne. [[Mount Cottrell, Victoria|Mount Cottrell]] is the highest land point in the vicinity.

The [[Rockbank railway station|railway station]] is on the [[Melton railway line|Melton line]]. Rockbank is also served by the Route {{MetlinkBus|numtext=yes|route=456}} bus that runs along the [[Western Freeway (Victoria)|Western Freeway]], linking Melton and [[Sunshine, Victoria|Sunshine]].

The rich, red volcanic soil in the area has helped build the reputation of local [[wineries]]. Rockbank is also the host to Victoria&amp;apos;s Annual [[Olive]] Festival. The earlier agricultural activities date back to the pastoral exploits of [[William Cross Yuille]] on the plains.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite Australasia|Yuille, William Crosse}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The town has an [[Australian rules football]] team competing in the [[Riddell District Football League]]. Koori Elder Steven Hanning also play for the side and are respected elders of the rockbank community. Steven also coaches the women c-grade netball team.
