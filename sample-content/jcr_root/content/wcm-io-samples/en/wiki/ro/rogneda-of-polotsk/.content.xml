&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rogneda of Polotsk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (962–1002) is the [[Slavic (language)|Slavic]] name for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ragnhild&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, whose father [[Rogvolod|Ragnvald]] (Slavic: [[Rogvolod]]) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;came from overseas&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (i.e., from [[Scandinavia]]) and established himself at [[Polatsk]] in the mid-10th century.

It has been speculated that Rogneda belonged to the [[Ynglings]] royal family of [[Norway]]. In or about 980, [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir]], on learning that she was betrothed to his half-brother [[Yaropolk I]] of [[Kiev]], took Polotsk and forced Rogneda to marry him. Having raped Rogneda in the presence of her parents, he ordered them to be killed, along with two of Rogneda&amp;apos;s brothers.

Rogneda gave him several children. The four sons were [[Yaroslav the Wise]], Vsevolod, [[Mstislav of Chernigov]], and [[Izyaslav of Polotsk]]. She also bore two daughters, one of whom is named by [[Nestor the Chronicler]] as [[Predslava]] (taken as a concubine of [[Boleslaus I of Poland]], according to [[Gallus Anonymus|Gallus]]). A later chronicle tells a story, most likely taken from a [[Norse saga]], of Rogneda plotting against Vladimir and asking her elder son, Izyaslav, to kill him. As was the Norse royal custom, she was sent with her elder son to govern the land of her parents, i.e. Polotsk. Izyaslav&amp;apos;s line continued to rule Polotsk and the newly-found town of [[Izyaslavl]] until the [[Mongol invasion of Russia|Mongol invasion]].

After Vladimir converted to Christianity and took [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]] as his wife, he had to divorce all his previous wives, including Rogneda. After that, she entered the convent and took the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anastasia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Around 1825 [[Kondraty Fyodorovich Ryleyev|Kondraty Ryleev]] wrote a narrative poem entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rogneda&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  This poem became a literary source for her portrayal in the nationalist Russian opera &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Rogneda (opera)|Rogneda]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Alexander Serov]], which premiered in 1865.
