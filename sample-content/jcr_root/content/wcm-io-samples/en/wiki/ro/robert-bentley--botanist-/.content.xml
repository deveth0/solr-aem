He subsequently studied medicine at [[King&amp;apos;s College London]], and became a [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|Member of the Royal College of Surgeons]] in 1847 and a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1849.

Bentley served as botany lecturer at the Medical School of the London Hospital, and in 1859 became Professor of Botany at [[King&amp;apos;s College London]].

In 1874, Bentley was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]], and he served as joint editor of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;British Pharmacopeia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of 1885.

He died in 1893 and was buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].
