&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rolf Aldag&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 25 August 1968 in [[Beckum, Germany]]) is a former professional [[road bicycle racer]] who rode for [[Team Telekom]] from 1993 to 2005. He raced in 10 [[Tour de France]], 1 [[Giro d&amp;apos;Italia]] and 5 [[Vuelta a España]]. Prior to joining Telekom, he raced with [[Helvetia]].

== Career ==
His career highlights include third stage place in both the 1994 and 1995 Tour de France, a stage win in the [[Tour de Limousin]] in 1996, a stage win in the [[Tour de Suisse]] 1997, overall win of the [[Bayern-Rundfahrt]] in 1999, a stage win in the [[Deutschland Tour]] 1999, being the German road Champion in 2000, a stage win Deutschland Tour 2001, a stage win in the Bayern-Rundfahrt 2002, a 2nd stage place in the [[2003 Tour de France]], winner of the Sparkassen-Giro Bochum in 2003, and winner of the Sparkassen Cup Unna in 2003.

Aldag featured in the film [[Hell on Wheels (2004 film)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hell on Wheels&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] concerning the 2003 Tour de France.

In &amp;quot;retirement&amp;quot;, Aldag has set a goal of competing in Ironman triathlons. His first training goal was to complete a marathon in 2 hours 40 minutes. He finished the Hamburg marathon in April 2006 with a time of 2 hours 42 minutes. He went on to finish the 2006 Ironman Lanzarote triathlon in the Canary Islands in 50th place of 825 finishers with a total time of 10:22:14 (swim 1:23:18, bike 5:18:05, run 3:27:56).

T-Mobile hired Aldag as sporting director after sacking [[Rudy Pevenage]] who was named in the 2006 [[Operación Puerto doping case]].

Aldag managed the team up the end of 2011 when {{ct|THR}} folded due to lack of sponsorship.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/aldag-blasts-uci-mcquaid-and-pro-cycling&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Doping Confession ==
On 24 May 2007 Aldag together with former Team Telekom team mate and personal friend [[Erik Zabel]] admitted having used [[Erythropoietin]] (EPO) from 1995 to 1999. Aldag also publicly apologized for having lied about his use of EPO in the past.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news| url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2007/may07/may24news2 |title=Zabel and Aldag confess EPO usage |date=2007-05-24 |accessdate=2007-05-24 |work=cyclingnews.com |first=Susan |last=Westemeyer}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
His confession was triggered by accusations of former Team Telekom masseur [[Jef d&amp;apos;Hont]] from Belgium. In his book, of which excerpts where printed in the German political magazine [[Der Spiegel]] in April 2007, D&amp;apos;Hont accused members of Team Telekom of systematic and organized doping with EPO in the mid-1990s.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;DS-2007-04-28&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/0,1518,480042,00.html Masseur wirft Team Telekom systematisches Doping vor] Der Spiegel, 28 April 2007 (German)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
