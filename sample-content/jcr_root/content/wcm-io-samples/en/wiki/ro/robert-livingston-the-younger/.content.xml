&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Robert Livingston the Younger&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1663 â€“ April 1725), sometimes known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Robert Livingston, jr.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Nephew&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a wealthy merchant and political figure in colonial [[Albany, New York]].

He was the son of James Livingston and nephew of [[Robert Livingston the Elder]]. Born in [[Scotland]], he emigrated to America from [[Rotterdam]] in 1687 and settled in Albany where he managed his uncle&amp;apos;s Albany enterprises.

Also in 1710 he took over the post of Secretary for the Commissioners of Indian Affairs from his uncle and served in that position until his death.

In 1697 married Margareta (or Margarita) Schuyler (b. 1682), the daughter of [[Pieter Schuyler]], the first mayor of Albany. They had several children who &amp;quot;married into the best provincial families and enjoyed great success in the business of New York, Montreal, and the lands in between&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|last=Bielinski|first=Stefan|title=Robert Livingston, Jr.|url=http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/albany/bios/l/rlivingstonjr.html|work=The People of Colonial Albany Live Here|publisher=The New York State Museum|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; One source lists five children: Engeltje (bap. 1698), James (bap. 1701), Janet (bap. 1703), Peter (bap. 1706), and John (bap. 1709)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Livingston|first=Edwin Brockholst|title=The Livingstons of Livingston Manor|year=1910|publisher=Knickerbocker Press|location=New York|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Yk5mAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;lpg=PA562&amp;amp;ots=lJH8CFRpGe&amp;amp;dq=robert%20livingston%20family%20nephew&amp;amp;pg=PA562#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=robert%20livingston%20family%20nephew&amp;amp;f=false}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;{{rp|pp.562-563}}.
