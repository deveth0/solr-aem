&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rosanna&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[railway station]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], located in the suburb of [[Rosanna, Victoria|Rosanna]], on the [[Hurstbridge railway line]]. Rosanna is manned Monday-Friday between 7:30am and 9:30am and is in [[Metcard]] &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:blue;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Zone 2&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;.

==Facilities==

Rosanna is located at the southern end of the Lower Plenty Road level crossing, with station access from Turnham Avenue, Beetham Parade and Lower Plenty Road.

The station consists of two [[side platforms]]; Platform 1 has a large [[fibro]] building, while platform 2 has a smaller fibro building. A large [[Metcard]] ticket vending machine is located at the entrance to platform 1, which is able to dispense most ticketing options available and also accept notes and coins. A small coin-only Metcard ticket vending machine is located at the entrance to platform 2, as well as at the entrance to platform 1.

Between Rosanna and [[Heidelberg railway station|Heidelberg station]] the line is [[Single track (rail)|single track]], and passes under a hill by a short tunnel. This arrangement results in delays to trains during busy periods as only one train can occupy the section at one time.
