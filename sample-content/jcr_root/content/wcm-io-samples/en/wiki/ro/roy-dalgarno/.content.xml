==Career==
He joined the [[Communist Party of Australia]] in the 1930s but, according to art historian [[Bernard William Smith|Bernard Smith]], his bohemian temperament was incompatible with party puritanism. He left the party in 1949. In the late 1930s he travelled to the canefields of North [[Queensland]], where he concentrated on his painting.

He co-founded the [[Studio of Realist Art]] (SORA) [[Sydney]] in 1946.  From 1947 to 1949 he worked as lecturer at the East Sydney Technical College. After studying in Paris, he moved to India, where he co-founded &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Editions Anarkali&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, publisher of fine arts in [[Bombay]], while being employed as a visiting lecturer in lithography at the School of Fine Arts.

In 1953 he won the First Prize for Diploma Students, lithography, at the [[Ecole des Beaux Arts]], Paris. In 1965 he won first prize at the Mahasartra State ([[India]]) exhibition.

In 1975 he moved to [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], where he worked as a Lecturer in drawing and composition at the Auckland Society of Arts.

Described as a [[socialist]] [[bohemian]] and a social realist painter, his work commissioned by the Australian maritime and mining trade unions is perhaps the best remembered, for its depiction of Australian workers and working conditions.

The art historian [[Bernard William Smith|Bernard Smith]] wrote of Dalgarno: “He belongs to that great generation of social realist Australian artists who flourished during World War II and early post-war years but &amp;amp;ndash; in the aftermath of the Cold War &amp;amp;ndash; are now largely stored and forgotten by curators.” (&amp;apos;Artist of the Everyday&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Australian&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 23 February 2001)
