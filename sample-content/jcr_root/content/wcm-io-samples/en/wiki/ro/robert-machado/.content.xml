&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Robert Alexis Machado&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [ma-CHAH-do] (born June 3, 1973 in [[Carabobo State|Puerto Cabello, Carabobo State]], [[Venezuela]]) is a former [[catcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played most recently with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] organization. Previously, Machado played for the [[Chicago White Sox]] ({{By|1996}}-{{By|1998}}), [[Montreal Expos]] ({{By|1999}}), [[Seattle Mariners]] ({{By|2000}}), [[Chicago Cubs]] ({{By|2001}}-{{By|2002}}), [[Milwaukee Brewers]] (2002), and [[Baltimore Orioles]] ({{By|2003}}-{{By|2004}}). He batted and threw [[right-handed]].

Machado was a solid defensive catcher with a strong arm, but his little offensive value limited his effectiveness as an everyday player. His most productive season came in 2001 with the Cubs, when he posted a .997 of [[fielding percentage]] and threw out 13 of 39 baserunners who attempted to [[stolen base|steal]] off him. He also had eight multi-hit games, including three over a six-game span, when he went 9-for-23 with three [[Double (baseball)|doubles]] and a [[home run]].

In a nine-year career, Machado was a .230 hitter with 11 home runs and 61 RBI in 230 games.

Machado received a 15-game suspension for violating Major League Baseball&amp;apos;s minor-league drug treatment and prevention program.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/news/050404steroids.html |title=38 Suspended For Steroids |accessdate=2009-02-02|last=Manuel |first=John |date=2005-04-04 |publisher=[[Baseball America]]}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
