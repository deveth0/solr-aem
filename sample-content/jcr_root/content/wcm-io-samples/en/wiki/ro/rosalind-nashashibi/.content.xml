&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rosalind Nashashibi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1973) is an English artist of Irish and Palestinian descent.

Born in [[Croydon]], Nashashibi studied at the [[Glasgow School of Art]]. She lived in Glasgow for some years after graduation, but now resides in London. Much of her work consists of films of everyday life in [[urban area|urban]] environments.[http://www.xpatloop.com/articles.php?id=6181]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The State of Things&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a black-and-white film of old ladies at a [[Salvation Army]] [[jumble sale]] with a love song by the Egyptian singer Um Kolsoum on the soundtrack. The exact location of the film is unclear, and Nashashibi has said that many people, when first seeing the grainy footage, assume the women to be from some non-British culture or from an earlier time.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dahiet a Bareed, District of the Post Office&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was filmed in the [[West Bank]] in an area designed by the artists grandfather. The film is of people playing [[football (soccer)|football]], having their hair cut and so on. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Midwest&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Midwest Field&amp;apos;&amp;apos; depict life in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].

In 2003, Nashashibi won the [[Beck&amp;apos;s Futures]] prize, the first woman to do so, for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The State of Things&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Maev Kennedy, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2003/apr/30/arts.artsnews  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Film-maker wins Beck&amp;apos;s award&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Guardian&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Wednesday April 30, 2003.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Her work is held in the collection of the [[Tate]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;amp;artistid=7347&amp;amp;page=1 tate.org.uk]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
