The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rockford Lightning&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[basketball]] team that played in the [[Continental Basketball Association]].  They were based in [[Rockford, Illinois]].  The Lightning were the oldest team in the CBA, originally existing as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Lancaster Red Roses (basketball)|Lancaster Red Roses]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].  That team changed their name to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lancaster Lightning&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, then the franchise moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] for a year before relocating in Rockford.  Their home arena was the [[Rockford MetroCentre|MetroCentre]].  They were the runners-up in the 2001-02 and 2004-05 CBA seasons, losing a winner-take-all championship game to the [[Dakota Wizards]] 116-109 in 2002, and a best-of-5 series to the [[Sioux Falls Skyforce]] 3-1 in 2005.  On January 20, 2006, the team&amp;apos;s owner announced that the Lightning would cease operations after the season unless other investors purchased the team and continued its operations.  An attempt was made to constitute a new local ownership group, but it was unsuccessful, and the team folded.  The Lightning&amp;apos;s main rivals were the [[Quad City Thunder]].
