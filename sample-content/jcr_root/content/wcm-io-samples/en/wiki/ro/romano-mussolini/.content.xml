&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Romano Mussolini&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (26 September 1927&amp;amp;nbsp;– 3 February 2006) was the fourth and youngest son of [[Benito Mussolini]], fascist dictator of [[Italy]] from 1922 to 1943. Romano was never involved in politics, but rather was a well-appreciated [[jazz]] pianist, painter and an unsuccessful film producer.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/obituaries/same-name-different-fame/2006/03/17/1142582520356.html?page=2 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Same name, different fame | date=March 18, 2006}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Biography==
A native of Villa Carpena, [[Forlì]] ([[Emilia-Romagna]]), Romano Mussolini studied music as a child, playing classical pieces with his father on the violin.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/02/03/mussolini-jazz-obit.html |title=Jazz pianist Romano Mussolini dies at 78 |publisher=CBC Arts |date=February 3, 2006}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

After World War II, he started playing jazz under an assumed name and by the mid-1950s, he had formed a trio. Romano Mussolini released a self-titled record through [[RCA Records]] in 1956. By the 1960s, he had formed the &amp;quot;Romano Mussolini All Stars&amp;quot;, which became one of Italy&amp;apos;s foremost jazz bands.

The All Stars recorded a well-received record &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jazz Allo Studio 7&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1963 with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;At the Santa Tecla&amp;apos;&amp;apos; following a year later. Mussolini&amp;apos;s band toured internationally with artists including [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Helen Merrill]] and [[Chet Baker]]. In the 1990s, Mussolini recorded two more albums, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Perfect Alibi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Soft and Swing&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. His playing style has been described as &amp;quot;...like a slightly melancholic [[Oscar Peterson]]. Occasionally inspired, he was always efficient; he made the refrains run on time.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Romano Mussolini 2006&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/05/he-made-the-refrains-run-on-time/4782/ |title=He made the refrains run on time |first=Mark |last=Steyn |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly |date=May 2006}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1962, Mussolini married [[Anna Maria Villani Scicolone]], the sister of actress [[Sophia Loren]]. They had two daughters, Elisabetta and her elder sister [[Alessandra Mussolini]], who was a member of the [[European Parliament]], and leads an Italian [[national conservative]] party, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Alternativa Sociale]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Romano Mussolini composed the party&amp;apos;s official anthem, &amp;quot;The Pride of Being Italian&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Romano Mussolini 2006&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; With his second wife, the actress Carla Maria Puccini, he had a third daughter, Rachele, named after his mother [[Rachele Mussolini]].

Mussolini was very reserved about his family history. It was only in 2004 that he published a book, entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Il Duce]], mio padre&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Il Duce, my father&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), followed by a similar book in 2005, collecting personal memories and accounts of private confidences and discussions with his father.

He was the last surviving child of Benito Mussolini.
He died, aged 78, in a hospital in Rome of undisclosed causes.
