A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;rock crystal vase&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[vase]] made of [[rock crystal]], a type of [[hardstone carving]].

Some such vases were rare expensive items, decorated with [[gold]] and [[Gemstone|jewel]]s, used by [[Royal family|royalty]] in [[Europe]].

A rock crystal vase that probably originated in the seventh century was given to [[William IX of Aquitaine]] (the [[Troubadour]]) by a Muslim ally. When [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], William IX&amp;apos;s granddaughter, married King [[Louis VII of France]] in 1137, she gave him the rock crystal vase as a wedding present.  The inscription on it says he, in turn, gave it to the [[Abbey of St.-Denis]].  It is now in the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]] and is the only artifact of Eleanor&amp;apos;s known to exist today.

Another was a crystal and gold [[posset]] set the Spanish Ambassador gave [[Mary I of England]] and [[Philip II of Spain]] as a betrothal gift.  It was made by [[Benvenuto Cellini]] and the whole set is now on display at [[Hatfield House]] ([[England]]).
