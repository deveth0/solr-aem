==Private life==
Christopher was born in [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]], [[Massachusetts]]. She has one brother. Her family&amp;apos;s surname is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;DiCristoforo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; they are of [[Italian people|Italian]] descent.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} She graduated from Mt. St. Joseph Academy in Brighton, Massachusetts with the class of 1983. She married former &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Another World&amp;apos;&amp;apos; co-star, [[Matt Crane]] in 2000.  They have two children together a son August Christopher (b. July 14, 2004) and a daughter Gianna Maria (b. July 10, 2006). Her daughter played her daughter [[Lila Rae Alcazar]] on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;General Hospital&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. They live in Pennsylvania.

==Career==
Christopher is the only actor to have played the same character ([[Skye Chandler]]) as a regular cast member on all three of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]&amp;apos;s soap operas: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[All My Children]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1987–91, 2000), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[One Life to Live]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1998–2001) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[General Hospital]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2001–08, 2010, 2011, 2012). Christopher portrayed Lorna Devon on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1994–97).  In both roles, on two different networks, Christopher&amp;apos;s biological mother was portrayed by soap opera star [[Linda Dano]], who played Skye&amp;apos;s mother, [[Rae Cummings]], on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[All My Children]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[One Life to Live]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Port Charles]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[General Hospital]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and Lorna&amp;apos;s mother, [[Felicia Gallant]], on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

When Christopher began playing Skye Chandler, the character was known as Skye Patterson. Over the years, the character married, divorced, remarried, redivorced, and believed on two occasions to have discovered and grown closer to her biological family, the Chandlers on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[All My Children]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and Quartermaines on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[General Hospital]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, only to discover her biological origins to be far murkier than originally realized.

In accord with Skye&amp;apos;s nomadic journey through the ABC soaps and ultimate independence, Robin Christopher has often been referred to by fans as the &amp;apos;[[Greta Garbo]] of soap opera&amp;apos;, evoking in her performance the glamour and emotional depth of [[Classical Hollywood cinema]].

In 1993, Christopher guest starred in two episodes of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s first season, &amp;quot;[[Duet (DS9 episode)|Duet]]&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;[[In the Hands of the Prophets]]&amp;quot;, as the [[Bajoran]] engineer Neela.
