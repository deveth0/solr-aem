&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rok Petrovič&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{audio|RokPetrovic.ogg|listen}} (February 5, 1966 - September 16, 1993) was a [[Slovenes|Slovenian]] alpine [[skier]].

Petrovič was born in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]], the son of [[Kresimir Petrovic|Krešimir Petrović]], a well known [[sports psychologist]] of [[Croats|Croatian]] origin. His first success in alpine ski racing was the 1983 Junior World Championship [[Slalom skiing|slalom]] title in [[Sestriere]], Italy.

After this he rapidly advanced up the world slalom rankings. In the 1985–86 [[Alpine Skiing World Cup]] season, he was practically unbeatable in slalom, his competition left to wait for rare mistakes in his highly aggressive and innovative skiing style. That season he won 5 races, is second in [[St. Anton]], Austria and third in [[Geilo]], Norway, easily winning the World Cup [[Slalom skiing|slalom]] title and becoming the first [[Slovenes|Slovenian]] with a crystal globe.

After his championship-winning season, Petrovič was unable to recapture his winning form, the only hint of his championship season being a second place behind his teammate [[Bojan Križaj]] at the unforgettable race in [[Kranjska Gora]] next season.  He finished eighth in the 1988 [[Winter Olympic Games]] [[giant slalom]].

Due to his lack of winning results, he quit skiing in 1988 and began studies at the College of Sports in Ljubljana. He graduated in 1991 and continued with post-graduate study. He was to defend his M.Sc. thesis in the autumn of 1993, but shortly before defending his thesis he took a short break at the Croatian island [[Korčula]] and drowned in a diving accident.

Altogether he won 5 World Cup races, all in slalom and all in his champion season in 1985-86:
