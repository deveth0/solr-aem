&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Robert Woodrow Wilson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born January 10, 1936) is an [[United States|American]] [[astronomer]], 1978 Nobel laureate in [[Nobel Prize in physics|physics]], who with [[Arno Allan Penzias]] discovered in 1964 the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB). The award purse was also shared with a third scientist, [[Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa]], for unrelated work.

While working on a new type of [[Holmdel Horn Antenna|antenna]] at [[Bell Labs]] in [[Holmdel Township, New Jersey]], they found a source of noise in the atmosphere that they could not explain. After removing all potential sources of noise, including pigeon droppings on the antenna, the noise was finally identified as CMB, which served as important corroboration of the [[Big Bang]] theory.

==Life and work==
Robert Woodrow Wilson was born on January 10, 1936, in Houston, Texas. He graduated from [[Lamar High School (Houston)|Lamar High School]] in River Oaks [[Houston]]&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;HISDAlumni&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;[http://www.houstonisd.org/HISDConnectDS/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=c3783acb02efc010VgnVCM10000052147fa6RCRD Distinguished HISD Alumni],&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Houston Independent School District]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and studied as an undergraduate at [[Rice University]] (Houston), where he was inducted into the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] society. His graduate work was done at [[California Institute of Technology]].

Wilson and Penzias also won the [[Henry Draper Medal]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1977.&amp;lt;ref name=Draper&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Draper Medal|url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_draper|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
