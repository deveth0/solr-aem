&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Robert Abbot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1588? - 1662?) was an [[England|English]] [[theology|theologian]] who promoted [[puritan]] doctrines. He is sometimes mistakenly described as the son of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[George Abbot (bishop)|George Abbot]], but this is generally considered to be incorrect. The misunderstanding probably stems from a passage in Robert Abbot&amp;apos;s work &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Hand of Fellowship to Helpe Keepe out Sinne and Antichrist&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in which he thanks the Archbishop for &amp;quot;worldly maintenance,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;best earthly countenance&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fatherly incouragements.&amp;quot;

==Biography==
Robert Abbot received his education at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], and later at
[[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]. The details of Abbot&amp;apos;s ecclesiastical career are somewhat unclear, and can only be pieced together from fragmentary evidence, but based on something he wrote in his work &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bee Thankfull London and her Sisters&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, it is probable that he began his church service with a posting as &amp;quot;assistant to a [[reverend]] divine&amp;quot;. A note in the margin indicates that the reverend in question was &amp;quot;Master Haiward of Wool Church&amp;quot;, in [[Dorset]]. In 1616, it is known that he was appointed by George Abbot to the vicarage of [[Cranbrook, Kent|Cranbrook]] in [[Kent]]. His ministry at Cranbrook was regarded as successful, but he was noted for his lack of tolerance towards [[nonconformism|nonconformists]]. In 1643, Abbot left Cranbrook, becoming vicar of [[Southwick, Hampshire|Southwick]], [[Hampshire]]. Later, he became pastor at the &amp;quot;extruded&amp;quot; Udall of St Austin&amp;apos;s, in [[London]], where he apparently still served in 1657. Between 1657 and 1658, and in 1662, Abbot appears to vanish from record, and his activities are unknown.

==Written works==
Robert Abbot&amp;apos;s books are conspicuous amongst the works of his time by their terseness and variety. In addition to those mentioned above he wrote &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Triall of our Church-Forsakers&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1639), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Milk for Babes, or a Mother&amp;apos;s Catechism for her Children&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1646), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Christian Family builded by God, or Directions for Governors of Families&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1653).
