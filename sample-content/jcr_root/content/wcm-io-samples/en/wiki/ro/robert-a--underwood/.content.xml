Underwood was born in [[Tamuning]], Guam, and attended [[California State University, Los Angeles]] and the [[University of Southern California]]. He became a high school teacher on the American mainland, and he then served as an instructor at the [[University of Guam]] from 1976 to 1983. Underwood was director of bilingual education assistance for [[Micronesia]] until 1988 and Academic Vice President of the University of Guam until 1992.

Underwood was elected as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] Delegate to the [[United States House of Representatives]], serving from January 3, 1993 to January 3, 2003. He left the House in 2003 after an unsuccessful 2002 run for [[Governor of Guam]] against Republican [[Felix Perez Camacho]].

Underwood ran again as a Democrat for [[Governor of Guam]] in 2006, with running mate [[Frank Aguon]] for Lieutenant Governor.  He defeated his main Democratic rival, former Guam governor [[Carl T.C. Gutierrez]], in the primary on September 3, 2006, [http://www.guampdn.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060903/NEWS01/60902001/1002] but again lost to incumbent Republican Governor [[Felix Perez Camacho]], 50%-48%.
