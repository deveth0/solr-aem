&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Robopsychology&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the study of the personalities of [[intelligent machine]]s. The term and the concept were popularised by [[Isaac Asimov]] in the short stories collected in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[I, Robot]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which featured robopsychologist [[Susan Calvin|Dr. Susan Calvin]], and whose plots largely revolved around the protagonist solving problems connected with intelligent [[robot]] behaviour.

The stories also introduced Asimov&amp;apos;s famous [[Three Laws of Robotics]]. Another robopsychologist mentioned by name (the only other one in the robot series) is Clinton Madarian, who is introduced as being Susan Calvin&amp;apos;s successor in the story &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Feminine Intuition]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

As described by Asimov, robopsychology appears to be a mixture of detailed [[mathematics|mathematical analysis]] and traditional [[psychology]], applied to robots. Human psychology is also a part, covering human interaction with robots. This includes the &amp;quot;[[Frankenstein complex]]&amp;quot; â€“ the irrational fear that robots (or other creations) will turn on their creator.
