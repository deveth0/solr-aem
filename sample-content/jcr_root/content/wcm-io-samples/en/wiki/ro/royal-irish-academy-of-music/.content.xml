The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Royal Irish Academy of Music&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (RIAM) is a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;linked college&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of [[Dublin City University]] located in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]].

It was founded in 1848 by a group of music enthusiasts and moved to its present address in Westland Row in 1871. The following year it was granted the right to use the title &amp;quot;Royal&amp;quot;. In addition to academic degrees, the RIAM offers a variety of courses and examinations in the fields of [[music]], [[public speaking]] and [[drama]], including associate and licentiate diplomas. Grade examinations and practical and teaching diplomas can be taken by internal and external students.

The [[Cathal Gannon]] Early Music Room was opened in May 2003; it contains a harpsichord and clavichord made by Cathal Gannon, a Broadwood grand piano restored by him, a square piano and information about Mr Gannon.

In September 2010 John O&amp;apos;Conor stepped down as director.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.riam.ie/news.html]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In September 2010 Deborah Kelleher was appointed Director of the RIAM
