&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Robert H. Adleman&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (May 7, 1919 - November 16, 1995) was an [[United States|American]] [[novelist]] and [[historian]].

Adleman was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].  A photographer and tail gunner in [[World War II]], he became a businessman and a historian, and began a collaboration with U.S. Army Colonel George Walton to write books about World War II, the most successful of which was 1966&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Devil&amp;apos;s Brigade (book)|The Devil&amp;apos;s Brigade]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos; A story about the [[1st Special Service Force]] nicknamed the &amp;quot;Devil&amp;apos;s Brigade&amp;quot;, the book would be turned into [[The Devil&amp;apos;s Brigade (film)|a motion picture of the same name]].

After selling the movie rights, Adleman and his wife moved from Philadelphia to [[Malibu, California]]. They remained there for a number of years until they acquired a large ranch property in [[Oregon]]. At which point they opened the restaurant The Bella Union, featuring the &amp;quot;peach baboo&amp;quot;, a cocktail named after their grandson&amp;apos;s childhood treat. Adleman died in [[Ashland, Oregon]], in 1995. His wife and two daughters scattered his ashes on the ocean at the beach in Malibu.
