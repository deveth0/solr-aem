&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rock candy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;rock sugar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a type of [[confectionery]] [[mineral]] composed of relatively large [[sugar]] [[crystal]]s. This [[candy]] is formed by allowing a [[Supersaturation|supersaturated]] solution of sugar and [[water]] to crystallize onto a surface suitable for crystal [[nucleation]], such as a string or stick. Heating the water before adding the sugar allows more sugar to dissolve thus producing larger crystals. Crystals form after 6–7 days. [[Food coloring]] may be added to the mixture to produce colored candy.

==Origins==
Candied sugar has its origins in [[Iran (Persia)|Iran]]. It has several different names in India among which are: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kallu Sakkare&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Kannada language|(Kannada)]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Panakarkandu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kalkandu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (kal – rock, kandu – candy) (Tamil/Malayalam), &amp;quot;khadi sakhar&amp;quot; (Marathi), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[mishri]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Hindi)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.tarladalal.com/glossary-misri-1150i Glossary: Misri] [[Tarla Dalal]] website.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;kalakanda/patika bellam&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Telugu); the [[Persian language|Persian]] word for rock candy is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;nabaat&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;. [[Arabic]] writers in the first half of the 9th century described the production of candy sugar, where crystals were grown as a result of cooling supersaturated sugar solutions. In order to accelerate crystallization, confectioners later learned to immerse small twigs in the solution for the crystals to grow on. The sugar solution was colored with [[cochineal]] and [[indigo dye|indigo]] and scented with [[ambergris]] or flower essence.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sugarindia.com/candy.htm Candy Sugar- the purest form of cane sugar!&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
In Mexico it is used for [[Day of the Dead]]. The children use rock candy to create sugar skulls. In China it is used as a part of [[traditional Chinese medicine]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}.

==Cuisine==
Rock candy is often dissolved in tea. It is an important part of the [[tea culture]] of [[East Frisia]], where a lump of rock sugar is placed at the bottom of the cup. It is also used in many nations, such as [[Hungary]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://bostontea.atw.hu/tea.php?PHPSESSID=33a264003c95ebfbd78f1f8c1f65bb63 Tea +kandiszcukor]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In [[China]], it is used to sweeten [[Chrysanthemum tea]] as well as [[tong sui|Cantonese dessert soups]] and the liquor &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[baijiu]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  In fact, in some provinces of China, rock sugar or &amp;quot;bing tang&amp;quot;(ice candy) is used in many dishes including meat, fish, chicken and vegetables as well as some fruits.  It is also viewed traditionally as having medical properties and is prepared in food as yao shan or literally medicine food.  In less modern times, rock sugar was affordable to only the rich.

Rock candy is widely used in [[India]] with [[fennel]] seeds as a mouth freshener, especially after meals, and is a common ingredient in [[Tamil cuisine]], particularly in the [[Sri Lanka]]n city of [[Jaffna]].

In the [[Friesland]] province of the [[Netherlands]], bits of rock candy are baked in the luxury white [[bread]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Fryske Sûkerbôle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
