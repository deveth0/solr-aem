&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Roath&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-cy|Y Rhath}}) is a district in the east/north-east of the [[city]] of [[Cardiff]], capital of [[Wales]]. It lies just east/north east of the city centre, stretching from [[Adamsdown]] in the south to [[Roath Park]] in the north. Roath contains the [[Plasnewydd]] [[electoral ward]].

Its main shopping streets are Albany Road, City Road, and Wellfield Road. The area is characterised by its several tree-lined [[avenue (landscape)|avenues]] and [[Victorian era]] terraced streets. Roath houses a very diverse population including a large number of students, being very close to the main university campuses, a large ethnic minority population and many young professionals. Parts of Roath are among the most affluent districts of Cardiff, although subdivision of the large Victorian properties is starting to occur in the areas at the south end of the district.

Its close proximity to the city centre, its number of local amenities, [[Church (building)|churches]], shops and [[restaurant]]s and [[public house]]s and the famous [[Roath Park]] make it a popular area to live.

==History==
The name is believed to originate from [[Irish language|Irish]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;rÃ¡th&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;fort&amp;apos;. Alternatively, it could derive from the name given to the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] settlement in Cardiff, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ratostabius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Roath contains the Church of [[Saint Margaret the Virgin|St Margaret of Antioch]], built in 1870 on the site of an earlier [[Normans|Norman]] chapel and the new [[Gothic revival]] church. Designed by [[Llandaff]] architect [[John Prichard]] on a Greek Cross plan, the latter was financed totally by [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute|the third Marquess of Bute]], in spite of his conversion to Catholicism in 1868.  Inside is an opulent mausoleum housing tombs of nine members of the [[Marquess of Bute|Bute]] family, including the First Marquess and his wives. The tower of St Margaret&amp;apos;s was finally completed in 1926.

Roath Court, a [[Georgian era]] [[manor house]], is found near Saint Margaret&amp;apos;s Church.
