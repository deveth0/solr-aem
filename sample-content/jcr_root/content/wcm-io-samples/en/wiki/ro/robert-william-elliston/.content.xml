[[File:Robert William Elliston by George Henry Harlow.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Robert William Elliston, by [[George Henry Harlow]]]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Robert William Elliston&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (7 April 1774 â€“ 7 July 1831) was an [[England|English]] [[actor]] and theatre manager.

He was born in [[London]], the son of a watchmaker.  He was educated at [[St Paul&amp;apos;s School (London)|St Paul&amp;apos;s School]], but ran away from home and made his first appearance on the stage as Tressel in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 1791.  There he was later seen as [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]], and in other leading parts, both comic and tragic, and he repeated his successes in London from 1796.

He acted at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] from 1804 to 1809, and again from 1812.  From 1819 he was the lessee of the house, presenting [[Edmund Kean]], [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Mme Vestris]], and [[William Charles Macready|Macready]].

He bought the [[Olympic Theatre]] in 1813 and also had an interest in a [[patent theatre]], the [[Theatre Royal, Birmingham]].  Ill-health and misfortune culminated in his [[bankruptcy]] in 1826, when he made his last appearance at Drury Lane as [[Falstaff]]. As the lessee of the [[Surrey Theatre]], he acted almost up to his death in 1831, which was hastened by [[alcoholism]].  At the Surrey, where he was the lessee first from 1806&amp;amp;ndash;14 and then again beginning in 1827, to avoid the patent restrictions on drama outside the West End, he presented [[Shakespeare]] and other plays accompanied by ballet music.

[[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] compared him favorably as an actor with [[David Garrick]]; [[Lord Byron]] thought him inimitable in high comedy; and [[William Charles Macready|Macready]] praised his versatility.

Elliston was the author of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Venetian Outlaw&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1805), and, with [[Francis Godolphin Waldron]], of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;No Prelude&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1803), in both of which plays he appeared.

His son was [[Henry Twiselton Elliston]].
