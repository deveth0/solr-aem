They play in tangerine and black strips, colours that they inherited from [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] after purchasing the floodlights from [[Tannadice Park]]. Rothes also have the most colourful support in the league, with Club 59.

Their current manager is Graham McBeath, who returned to the club during the 2009-10 season for his second spell as manager, replacing previous boss Donnie Mackay. McBeath steered Rothes to the Highland League Cup final in 2010 at a time when they were bottom of the Highland League.
