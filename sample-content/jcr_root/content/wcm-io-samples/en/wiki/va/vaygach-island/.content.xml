&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vaygach Island&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Вайга́ч}}) is an [[island]] in the [[Arctic Sea]] between the [[Pechora Sea]] and the [[Kara Sea]].

Vaygach Island is separated from the [[Yugorsky Peninsula]] in the [[mainland]] by the [[Yugorsky Strait]] and from Novaya Zemlya by the [[Kara Strait]]. The island is a part of [[Nenets Autonomous Okrug]] of [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]], [[Russia]].
* Area: {{convert|3383|km2}}
* Length: ~ {{convert|100|km}}
* Width: up to {{convert|45|km}}
* Average temperatures: {{convert|-20|C}} (February), {{convert|5|C}} (June)
* Highest point: {{convert|170|m|ft}}

Vaygach Island is mainly formed of [[argillaceous slate]]s, [[sandstone]], and [[limestone]]. There are many [[river]]s about {{convert|20|-|40|km}} in length, [[swamp]]s, and small [[lake]]s on the island. For the most part it consists of [[tundra]]. Slight rocky ridges run generally along its length, and the coast has low cliffs in places. The island consists mostly of limestone, and its elevation above the sea is geologically recent. Raised beaches are frequent. The rocks are heavily scored by ice, but this was probably marine ice, not that of [[glacier]]s. The settlements of Vaygach, Dolgaya Guba, and Varnek are located on the island.

==Fauna and flora==
Grasses, mosses and Arctic flowering plants are abundant, but there are no trees excepting occasional dwarf willows. Foxes and lemmings are spotted occasionally. While there are not many land animals on the island, birds are very numerous; a variety of ducks, waders etc. frequent the marshes and lakes.

==Nature reserve==
In 2007, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) and the Russian government have approved a nature reserve on Vaygach island.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news

==Ethnography==
The name of the island translates from the Nenets as &amp;quot;alluvial shore&amp;quot;. Until the 19th century, the island was an important shrine of the [[Nenets people|Nenets]] people. There were polycephalic wooden [[cult image|idols]] painted with blood of holy animals, primarily [[reindeer]]. Some of their sacrificial piles, consisting of drift-wood, deer&amp;apos;s horns and the skulls of bears and deer, have been observed by travellers. In spite of their conversion to Christianity, the Nenets still regard these piles with superstition.
