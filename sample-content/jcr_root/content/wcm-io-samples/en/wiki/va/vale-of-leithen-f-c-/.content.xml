&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vale of Leithen FC&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[association football]] club from the town of [[Innerleithen]], [[Scotland]]. They play in the [[East of Scotland League]], and their home games take place at the town&amp;apos;s Victoria Park.

The club is one of the oldest in the Scottish Borders having formed in 1891, they became full members of the [[Scottish Football Association]] in 1897. The club played at Caddon Park and initially played their first two games as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Leithen Vale&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; but subsequently changed their name to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vale of Leithen Football Club&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 1922 they moved to their current home, Victoria Park.

The team&amp;apos;s motto is &amp;quot;Keep Faith&amp;quot;, and features on their club crest, along with the town&amp;apos;s patron saint, [[St. Ronan]].

The home strip features a blue shirt with white sleeves, blue shorts and red socks; the away strip is all-red, with white trim on the sleeves.

As of 9 February 2009, the club&amp;apos;s new manager is Rab Paget, who took over from Lenny Rathie.

Vale of Leithen should not be confused with the slightly differently named Junior team [[Vale of Leven F.C.|Vale of Leven]].
