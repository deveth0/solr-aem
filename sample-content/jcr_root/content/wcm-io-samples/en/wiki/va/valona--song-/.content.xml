The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;valona&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a popular narrative song- and poetry-form of the Mexican state of [[Michoacán]]. Its main characteristics are: a bitter sense of humor, mainly with reference to [[erotism]] (being even sexually explicit at times) and social concerns; its lyrics are composed as groupings of ten-line strophes, each line made up of eight syllables; musically, all valonas are sung (in fact, almost recited) to just a single tune, with an instrumental refrain after each strophe, which can vary.

As a narrative popular genre, the valona is literarily and musically related to the Mexican [[corrido]], and because of its stylistic, it is akin with other Mexican genres composed in ten minor-verse strophes (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;décimas&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[espinela]]s&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), such as some [[huapango]]s and the [[son arribeño]], along with certain other Latin American genres, such as the Chilean [[run-run]] and the rhapsodes of the Argentine [[payador]]es.
