&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vartholomio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-el|Βαρθολομιό}}) is a town and a former [[Communities and Municipalities of Greece|municipality]] in [[Elis (regional unit)|Elis]], [[West Greece]], [[Greece]]. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality [[Pineios (municipality)|Pineios]], of which it is a municipal unit.&amp;lt;ref name=Kallikratis&amp;gt;[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Its population was 5,348 in 2001, of which 3,093 lived in the town proper. The municipal unit covers the southern part of the hilly Kyllini peninsula, and the plains to the southeast. The town Vartholomio is in the plains, on the right bank of the river [[Pineios (Peloponnese)|Pineios]], which flows into the [[Ionian Sea]] south of the town.

The town was at the junction of two railway lines, one from [[Kavasila, Elis|Kavasila]] to [[Kastro-Kyllini|Kyllini]], and the branch [[Vartholomio–Loutra Kyllinis railway line]]. Both railways have been dismantled. Vartholomio is 1&amp;amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Kalyvia Myrtountion]], 4&amp;amp;nbsp;km west of [[Gastouni]], 3&amp;amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Dimitra, Elis|Dimitra]], 10&amp;amp;nbsp;km southeast of Kyllini and 30&amp;amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Pyrgos, Elis|Pyrgos]].

The town has two elementary schools and one high school building, with a standard junior high school and a music oriented junior high school (the only one in Elis).{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} There are also two churches with yards, and a town square with cafes and tavernas. In 1988 and in 2002, two big earthquakes struck the town and most buildings were damaged, including its high school.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}
