A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bajracharya&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vajracharya&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhist]] priest among the [[Newar]] communities of [[Nepal]] and a Revered Teacher who is highly attained in the [[Tibet]]an  and [[Chinese Esoteric Schools]].  Vajracharya means &amp;apos;vajra holding priest&amp;apos;. They are also commonly called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Guru-ju&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gu-bhaju&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (a short form for Guru Bhaju) which are Nepali terms related to the Sanskrit term [[guru]], and translate as &amp;apos;teacher&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;priest&amp;apos;. The Bajracharya is the highest ranking of the Newar [[caste]]s that are born Buddhist.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Hattaway|first=Paul|title=Peoples of the Buddhist World: A Christian Prayer Diary|publisher=William Carey Library|year=2004|pages=198|isbn=0-87808-361-8|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OzEOKNPsv2EC&amp;amp;dq=Bajracharya+Buddhist&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;amp;cad=0}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; To become a professional Guruju, a person of the bajracharya caste must go through a number of rituals. The bajracharya boy goes through a ritualistic process of [[initiation]] known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bajravishekha&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bajracharya.org/nepalibuddhism.htm|title=A Brief Introduction of Distinctive Features of Nepalese Buddhism|year=2002|accessdate=2008-07-27}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; including shaving off the head as the [[Buddhahood|buddha]] and asking for [[alms]], at a minimum of seven houses a day in different places, in the tradition of [[bhikku|monks]] since the time of [[Gautama Buddha]]. A Vajracharya of the Hanmi Esoteric School is chosen because of his or her past life attainments and undergoes an intensive training and transmission with an [[Enlightened Master]] and ranks above a [[Rinpoche.]]

Sometimes  [[tantras|tantric]] [[Newar Buddhism]] and Esoteric Buddhism is referred to as &amp;apos;Vajracharya Buddhism&amp;apos;.

The writers of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-century Nepal&amp;apos;&amp;apos; explore the unusual relationship of the Vajracharyas and their assistant Shakyas with [[Buddhist monasticism]]:
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;Unlike Vajracharyas, Shakya men may not be priests for others, but together with Vajracharya men they are the members of the traditional Newar Buddhist monasteries, known honorifically as vihara and colloquially as baha or bahi. In so far as Shakya and Vajracharya men filled their roles in the monastery, they were monks. In effect, they were married, part-time monks.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|coauthors=Sarah LeVine, David N.
