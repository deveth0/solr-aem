        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vaal Triangle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[triangle|triangular]] area of land formed by [[Vereeniging]], [[Vanderbijlpark]] and [[Sasolburg]] - together they comprise a substantial urban complex in [[South Africa]] about 60&amp;amp;nbsp;km south of [[Johannesburg]]. [[Meyerton, Gauteng|Meyerton]], just north of Vereeniging, is also generally included in the complex, and residents of [[Sharpeville]], Boipatong, Bophelong, the greater [[Sebokeng]] area (including [[Evaton]], [[Orange Farm]], etc.), [[Heidelberg]], [[Zamdela]], and [[Potchefstroom]] also generally tend to consider themselves to live in the Vaal Triangle. The area straddles the [[Vaal River]] and is a major industrial region, which is home to former Iron and Steel Corporation [[Mittal Steel South Africa|Iscor]], now ArcelorMittal South Africa and [[Sasol]], the [[steel]] and [[Petroleum|oil]]-from-[[coal]] processing facilities.

Due to the heavy industries in and around the Vaal Triangle it became infamous for its [[Air Pollution|air pollution]] and [[respiratory disease]].  For this reason, local [[Afrikaans]] speaking people often refer to the region as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vuil Driehoek&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (meaning &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dirty Triangle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) as a pun on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vaal Driehoek&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the [[Afrikaans]] translation for Vaal Triangle).

Nearby is the [[Vaal dam|Vaal Dam]], from which the massive PWV megalopolis ([[Pretoria]], [[Witwatersrand]] and Vaal Triangle) draws its water. The PWV forms the urban heart of [[Gauteng province]]. The Witwatersrand is the name given to the area that comprises the Greater Johannesburg metropole and the gold-bearing reef along which [[gold]] was discovered in 1886.

The Vaal Dam is well-patronised by people from Johannesburg over the weekends and during holidays, as it provides extensive water recreation facilities some 70&amp;amp;nbsp;km south of the city.
