&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vasily Kirillovich Trediakovsky&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Васи́лий Кири́ллович Тредиако́вский (Тредьяко́вский)}}; {{OldStyleDate|March 5|1703|February 22}} in [[Astrakhan]] &amp;amp;ndash; {{OldStyleDate|August 17|1768|August 6}} in [[Saint Petersburg]]) was a [[Russia]]n poet, essayist and playwright who helped lay the foundations of classical [[Russian literature]].&amp;lt;ref name=berlin&amp;gt;{{cite book | last = Berlin | first = Isaiah | title = Russian Thinkers | publisher = Penguin Classics|authorlink=Isaiah Berlin | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-14-144220-4 |pages=379–380}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Trediakovsky was a Russian literary theoretician and poet whose writings contributed to the classical foundations of Russian literature. The son of a poor priest, Trediakovsky became the first Russian commoner to receive a humanistic education abroad, at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]] (1727–30) where he studied philosophy, linguistics and mathematics.&amp;lt;ref name=berlin/&amp;gt; Soon after his return to Russia he became acting secretary of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;de facto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; court poet.

In 1735 Trediakovsky published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Новый и краткий способъ къ сложенью российскихъ стиховъ&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;A new and brief way for composing of Russian verses&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), a highly theoretical work for which he is best remembered.&amp;lt;ref name=berlin/&amp;gt; It discussed for the first time in Russian literature such poetic genres as the [[sonnet]], the [[Rondeau (poetry)|rondeau]], the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], and the [[ode]]. In 1748 appeared his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Разговор об орфографии&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;A Conversation on Orthography&amp;quot;), the first study of the phonetic structure of the [[Russian language]]. He continued his advocacy of poetic reform in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;О древнем, среднем и новом стихотворении российском&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1752; &amp;quot;On Ancient, Middle, and New Russian Poetry&amp;quot;).

Trediakovsky was also a prolific translator of classical authors, [[medieval]] philosophers, and [[French literature]]. His translations frequently aroused the ire of the censors, and he fell into disfavour with his Academy superiors and conservative court circles. In 1759 he was dismissed from the Academy. His last major work was a translation of [[François Fénelon]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Les aventures de Telemaque&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1766; Tilemakhida), which he rendered in Russian [[hexameter]]s. His works marked the transition from [[syllabic verse|syllabic versification]] to [[meter (poetry)|metric verse]], more suited to the sound of the Russian tongue.
