        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vaginal mucus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a natural substance occurring within the [[vagina]], particularly the [[cervix]], that maintains a certain level of moisture at all times.

The volume, colour, and consistency of vaginal mucus changes according to the period of the [[menstrual cycle]]. Both the [[chemical]] make-up and the physical consistency ([[viscosity]]) change during this time.  A slippery, clear, [[egg white]]-like consistency usually indicates that the woman is ovulating.  Relative dryness usually indicates an infertile point in the menstrual cycle.

Excessive or oddly coloured mucus may indicate various [[infection]]s of the vagina or [[pregnancy]].

==As a sexual response==
During sexual stimulation the [[blood vessel]]s fill inducing [[vasocongestion]]. As a result, more fluids (largely [[sweat]]) are introduced to the genitals creating a higher level of moisture. This makes penetration of the vagina easier as it serves as natural [[vaginal lubrication]].
