The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Valley Hospital Medical Center&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, commonly known as Valley Hospital, is a [[for-profit hospital]] owned and operated by [[Universal Health Services]]. The 409-bed hospital is located in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].

==History==
The hospital was founded in 1972.

Established [[Southern Nevada]]&amp;apos;s first [[air ambulance]] service, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Flight for Life]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was owned by [[Metro Aviation]], in 1980. On December 4, 2001, Valley Hospital ended its contract with Metro Aviation, shutting down the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Flight for Life&amp;apos;&amp;apos; air ambulance service, and retiring the [[helipad]]. Valley Hospital completed a new helipad next to the emergency department with a grassy area in 2007.

Valley’s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Emergency Critical Care Center&amp;apos;&amp;apos; increased the number of beds from 28 to 42 on March 11, 2004. This project was completed when 11 urgent care beds were added to the center in June.

}}

From 1980 to 2001, the helipad was located on top of the hospital, adjacent to the lobby. After &amp;quot;Flight for Life&amp;quot; was sold to &amp;quot;[[Air Methods|Mercy Air Services]]&amp;quot; in 2001, the hospital created a landing zone just south of the emergency entrance in a dirt lot for Mercy Air&amp;apos;s bigger helicopters. In 2007 the hospital refurbished an old parking lot into a grassy area, complete with a new helipad right in front of the emergency entrance.
