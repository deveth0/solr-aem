&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Valldemossa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (in Catalan) or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Valldemosa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (in Spanish) is a [[village]] and [[municipality]] on the island of [[Majorca]], part of the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[autonomous community]] of the [[Balearic Islands]].

Valldemossa is famous for one landmark: the [[Valldemossa Charterhouse|Royal Charterhouse of Valldemossa]], built at the beginning of the 14th century, when the mystic and philosopher [[Ramon Llull]] lived in this area of Majorca.

In the 1830s the Spanish government confiscated monasteries, and the historic estate was sold to private owners, who have since hosted some prominent guests.  These have included the Polish composer [[Frédéric Chopin]] and his lover the French writer and pioneering feminist [[George Sand]] (who wrote a notable account of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Winter in Majorca&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, describing their 1838–39 visit and  praising the island&amp;apos;s natural beauty but criticizing what she perceived as the prejudice and  vices of the natives).

Later the Nicaraguan poet [[Rubén Darío]] was host of the Sureda y Montaner families who own the Chartreuse estate. To fight his own nightmares Rubén Dario would sleep in monk habits, however his drinking habits caused a rift with his private hosts and thus his departure from the former monastery and from Majorca.

Also [[Jorge Luis Borges]] lived in the town with his parents and his sister Norah, after the First World War let them free from their refuge in Geneva. Borges passionate friendship with the young artist Jacobo Sureda Montaner, son of the painter Pilar Montaner, was decisive for Borges writing mainly in Spanish.

Since the 19th century Valldemossa has been promoted internationally as a beautiful spot thanks to the affection of a distinguished traveller and cultural writer, the Austrian Archduke [[Ludwig Salvator]].

In 1956 British composer [[Joseph Horovitz]] visited the island, with his  wife Anna, on their honeymoon, and later named a [[clarinet]] piece, based on Spanish folk-tunes he had heard there, after the village.

Until the elections of 2007 the town&amp;apos;s mayor was the only one in the democratic Kingdom of Spain to remain in office from the times of the [[Francoist]] dictatorship (which legally disappeared as the current [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] was passed){{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
