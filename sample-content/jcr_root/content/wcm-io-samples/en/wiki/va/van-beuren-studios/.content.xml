        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Van Beuren Studios&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an American [[animation]] studio that produced theatrical cartoons from 1928 to 1936.

Producer [[Amadee J. Van Beuren (producer)|Amedee J. Van Beuren]] first became involved in the animation industry in 1920, when he formed a partnership with [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry]] and formed the &amp;quot;Aesop&amp;apos;s Fables Studio&amp;quot; for the production of the [[Aesop&amp;apos;s Film Fables]] cartoon series. van Beuren released Terry&amp;apos;s first sound cartoon &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dinner Time]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1928) through [[Pathé Exchange]] which later became part of RKO. Terry ran the animation studio while van Beuren focused on other parts of the business. In 1929, Terry quit to start his own [[Terrytoons]] studio and John Foster took over the animation department. It was at this time that the Fables Studio became the Van Beuren Studio.

Van Beuren released his films through [[RKO Radio Pictures]]. The early sound Van Beuren cartoons are almost identical to the late silent cartoons: highly visual, with little dialogue and occasional sound effects. Bandleaders [[Gene Rodemich]] and [[Winston Sharples]] supervised the music. The company&amp;apos;s main cartoon characters were &amp;quot;[[Tom and Jerry (Van Beuren)|Tom and Jerry]]&amp;quot;, a tall-and-short pair, usually vagrants who attempted various occupations. They share no relation to [[MGM]]&amp;apos;s more successful [[Tom and Jerry]], a cat and mouse, and the older series has been renamed &amp;quot;Van Beuren&amp;apos;s Tom and Jerry&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Dick and Larry&amp;quot; in various future incarnations. Van Beuren was keenly aware that successful cartoons often featured animated &amp;quot;stars,&amp;quot; and urged his staff to come up with new ideas for characters. Cubby, a mischievous little bear, resulted.

Van Beuren remained unsatisfied, and agreed to license the popular comic-strip character &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Little King]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and radio&amp;apos;s hottest comedy act, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Amos &amp;apos;n&amp;apos; Andy]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to adapt into animated form. Strangely, neither series was successful. Van Beuren then hired [[Walt Disney]] Director [[Burt Gillett]] and Animator [[Tom Palmer]] to create a new series of color cartoons. These handsome &amp;quot;Rainbow Parade&amp;quot; cartoons featured established characters: [[Felix the Cat]], [[Parrotville Parrots]], [[Molly Moo Cow]], and the [[Toonerville Trolley]] gang.

These Van Beuren efforts were well received, and Van Beuren had finally succeeded in sponsoring a popular cartoon series. However, RKO ended its distribution of Van Beuren cartoons in 1937 when it began distributing those of industry-leader Walt Disney.

The Van Beuren Corporation acquired and produced live-action features and shorts (including [[Frank_Buck_(animal_collector)|Frank Buck]]&amp;apos;s monster hit &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bring &amp;apos;Em Back Alive (1932 film)|Bring &amp;apos;Em Back Alive]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). In 1932, Van Beuren purchased 12 [[Charlie Chaplin]] silent films (his 1916–&amp;apos;18 &amp;quot;Lone Star&amp;quot; comedies for [[Mutual Film Corporation]]) for $10,000 apiece, added music by Winston Sharples and sound effects, reissuing them through RKO.

The Van Beuren library was sold to various television, reissue, and home-movie distributors in the 1940s and 1950s, including [[Commonwealth Pictures]] and [[Official Films]].
