Later on, Altfater served as the squadron [[navigator|navigating officer]] of the 1st destroyer division of the [[Baltic Fleet]] (1909–1910). During [[World War I]], Altfater was a spokesperson for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]], then head of the Military Administration under the Commander-in-chief of the [[Northern Fleet]]. In October 1917, Altfater was promoted to the rank of Rear-Admiral. After the [[October Revolution]], he joined the Soviets.
