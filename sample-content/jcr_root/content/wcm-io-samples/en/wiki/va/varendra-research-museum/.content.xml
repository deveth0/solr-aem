&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Varendra Museum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-bn|বরেন্দ্র জাদুঘর}}) is a museum, research center and popular visitor attraction located at the heart of [[Rajshahi]] town and maintained by [[Rajshahi University]] in [[Bangladesh]].

==History==
Varendra Museum was the first [[museum]] to be established in erstwhile [[East Bengal]] in 1910. The museum started out as the collection for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Varendra Anushandhan Samiti&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Varendra Investigation Society&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and got its current name in 1919. The [[Rajshahi Raj family|Rajahs of Rajshahi]] and [[Dighapatia Raj|Natore]], notably [[Prince Sarat kumar Rai of Dighapatia|Prince Sharat Kumar Ray]], donated their personal collections to Varendra Museum. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Varendra]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refers to an ancient &amp;apos;&amp;apos;janapada&amp;apos;&amp;apos; roughly corresponding to modern northern Bangladesh.

Excavation at [[Sompur Bihara]] was started by the society along with the [[University of Calcutta]] in 1923. In 1964, the museum became a part of [[Rajshahi University]].
