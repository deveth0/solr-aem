{{Audio|Vaksdal.ogg|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vaksdal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}} is a [[Municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in the [[Counties of Norway|county]] of [[Hordaland]], [[Norway]]. It is located in the [[Districts of Norway|traditional district]] of [[Nordhordland]].  The administrative centre is the village of [[Dale, Hordaland|Dalekvam]].

Vaksdal was created as a new municipality on January 1, 1964 after the merger of parts of [[Bruvik]], [[Evanger]], and [[Modalen]].

==General information==
===Name===
The [[Old Norse]] form of the name was probably &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vágsdalr&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The first element is the [[genitive case]] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;vágr&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which means &amp;quot;[[bay]]&amp;quot; and the last element is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;dalr&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which means &amp;quot;[[valley]]&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;dale&amp;quot;.

===Coat-of-arms===
The [[Coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] is from modern times.  They were granted in 1990. It shows three [[shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]]s for [[weaving]], which represents the [[textile industry]] of the municipality.

==Geography==
The municipality is mountainous, and stretches along both sides of the [[fjord]] [[Veafjorden]] with adjacent valleys. It includes part of the island [[Osterøy]]. In the north it includes the valleys Eksingedalen and Bergsdalen, with its borders extending into the mountains, bordering [[Sogn og Fjordane]] county in the north. The main centers of population are [[Dale, Hordaland|Dale]] (pop. 1158), Vaksdal (982) and [[Stanghelle]] (781).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.ssb.no/beftett/tab-2011-06-17-01.html Statistics Norway, 2011]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Dale and Vaksdal are industrial villages that arose around factories utilising the [[Hydroelectricity|hydro-electric]] power resources provided by the mountainous terrain and rainy climate. The [[Bergen Line|railway line]] between Norway&amp;apos;s two largest cities [[Oslo]] and [[Bergen]], and the main road between the same two cities, [[European route E16]], run through Vaksdal.
Lakes in the region include [[Askjelldalsvatnet]].

==History==
Vaksdal was created as a new municipality on January 1, 1964 after the merger of parts of [[Bruvik]], [[Evanger]], and [[Modalen]].
During [[Norwegian Campaign|the German invasion of Norway]] during [[World War II]], from 19 April to 24 April, there was heavy fighting within the borders of the present municipality, with German forces advancing along the railway line from Bergen towards [[Voss]]. The heaviest fighting was for the village of Vaksdal itself, from 19 to 23 April. Further fighting took place at Stanghelle and Dalseid on 23 and 24 April. Three Norwegian soldiers and one civilian, and a larger, but unknown, number of German soldiers fell in Vaksdal.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Wilhelm Hansteen, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Operasjonene til lands på Vestlandet og i Hallingdal og Numedal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Oslo, 1971&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
