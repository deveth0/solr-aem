&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vasily Vasiliyevich Tsibliyev&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Василий Василиевич Циблиев}}); born on February 20, 1954) is a [[Russia]]n [[cosmonaut]].

He was selected as a cosmonaut on March 26, 1987. Tsibliyev flew as Commander on [[Soyuz TM-17]] from July 1, 1993 to January 14, 1994 and on [[Soyuz TM-25]] from February 2, 1997 to August 14 of the same year. He retired on June 19, 1998.  Tsibliyev is currently Chief of the [[Yuri Gagarin Cosmonauts Training Center]] at Star City, Russia. &amp;lt;!-- can someone who reads Russian add the correct date he became commander?  I cannot tell if it was 2003 or 2004 from the machine-translation of his GCTC biography. --&amp;gt;

Tsibliyev is married with two children.

Tsibliyev was the commander in charge of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Mir]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; when it was hit by a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; spacecraft in 1997.
