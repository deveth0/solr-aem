        text="&lt;p&gt;French musician &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Valentin Clastrier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1947) is one of the few performers in the world specializing in contemporary music for the [[hurdy-gurdy]]; before Clastrier, the instrument was used primarily in the performance of European [[Medieval music|Medieval]] and folk musics.

He began his career as a guitarist, and was introduced to the hurdy-gurdy in 1970.  His instrument has 27 strings rather than the conventional six.
Since 2006 Clastrier works together with Wolfgang Weichselbaumer [http://www.weichselbaumer.cc/]
on a new prototype.

Clastrier&amp;apos;s strikingly original compositions for the instrument (in both acoustic and electroacoustic versions) have been recorded, in collaboration with other creative European musicians (including tubist and [[Serpent (instrument)|serpent]] player [[Michel Godard]], [[accordion]]ist [[Jean-Louis Matinier]], saxophonist/clarinetists [[Michaël Riessler]] and [[Louis Sclavis]], and percussionists [[Gérard Siracusa]] and [[Carlo Rizzo]]).
