It was founded in 1147 by [[William, Count of Aumale]], [[Earl of York]]. Its site is within the [[Grimsthorpe Castle]] park, in [[Lincolnshire]], 6&amp;amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Bourne, Lincolnshire|Bourne]] on the [[A151 road|A151]], but there are no remains of the Abbey aside from earthworks.&amp;lt;ref name=ps1&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=348506|title=National Monument record for Vaudey Abbey}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
__TOC__
The [[Victoria County History]] contains a substantial report and a list of Abbots.&amp;lt;ref name=vch&amp;gt;{{cite book|series=Victoria County History|title=A History of the County of Lincoln |volume=2 |editor-first=William |editor-last=Page |year=1906 |pages= 143–145 &amp;apos;Houses of Cistercian monks: The abbey of Vaudey&amp;apos; |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=38007 |accessdate=2010-01-03}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Foundation==
Vaudey Abbey was founded by monks from [[Fountains Abbey]], who first settled at [[Bytham]] on 26 May 1147, near William’s [[Castle Bytham]]. However, they soon found the land unsuitable, and by 1149 one of William’s tenants, [[Geoffrey de Brachecourt]], had given the monks new lands in nearby Grimsthorpe. This new site was named &amp;quot;Vallis Dei&amp;quot; (Valley of God), or &amp;quot;Vaudey&amp;quot; in the vernacular.&amp;lt;ref name=vch/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|first=David |last=Knowles|coauthors=R Neville Hadcock|year=1953|title=Medieval religious houses : England and Wales|page=117}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Prosperity==
During the 13th century, the house flourished with profits from wool, which by the late 13th century reached approximately £200 per year. In 1229, the abbot was sent in the king’s name to bear messages to [[Llywelyn the Great|Llewelyn, Prince of Wales]], and in 1280 the abbot was empowered to arrest all vagabond Cistercian monks or lay-brothers, by the help of the secular arm, and to inflict appropriate punishment. However, by the end of the thirteenth century the abbey was experiencing financial difficulties and the number of monks had likely fallen.&amp;lt;ref name=vch/&amp;gt;

==Dissolution==
The house was suppressed with the smaller monasteries in 1536. At [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|Dissolution]], the net annual income of the abbey was £124.&amp;lt;ref name=vch/&amp;gt; By the mid-16th century, the abbey buildings were in ruins. In 1539, Henry VIII granted [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk]] the lands of Vaudey Abbey, and he used its stone as building material for his new house. In 1736 [[William Stukeley]] noted that only the precinct wall remained intact.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Stukeley&amp;apos;s Memoirs 2 31.7.1736.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On the other side of [[Grimsthorpe Park]], Scottlethorpe has substantial stone remains now used as part of a barn.  This may be remains of an unrelated Chapel known to have been located there, or might have been re-located from Vaudey Abbey&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=348455|title=National Monument record for Chapel at Scottlethorpe}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
