&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Valley of Peace&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Valle de Paz&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in original Spanish) is a [[village]] in the [[Cayo District]] of [[Belize]]. In 2000 Valley of Peace had a [[population]] of 1,809 people. The population in 2007 grew to 2,108.

It was created as a [[refugee]] community for immigrants fleeing from the [[El Salvador Civil War]].  Each family was facilitated with a plot of land and are the predominant suppliers of [[vegetable]]s to the [[Belmopan]] area.  This community started with a total of seven families.  Of these families; five were refugees (Alfaro, UmaÃ±a, Cruz, Echeverria, Barrera, Hernandez, and Zometa), one was Belizean [[Kriol]] (Mr. Scott and his family) and a [[Mennonite]] family (Mr. Duek &amp;amp; Family). But yet Valley of Peace is still the peaceful village that it has been for more than 25 years.
