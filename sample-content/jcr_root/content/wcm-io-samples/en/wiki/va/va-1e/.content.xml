&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;VA-1E (Attack Squadron 1E)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an aviation unit of the [[United States Navy]]. It had been established on 26 March 1945 as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Torpedo Squadron 41 (VT-41)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and was redesignated &amp;quot;VA-1E&amp;quot; on 15 November 1946. The [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was disestablished on 1 September 1948. It was the only squadron to be designated VA-1E.

==History==
VT-41 was established as a torpedo squadron, flying the [[TBF Avenger|Grumman TBF-1 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Avenger&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] torpedo bomber at [[Naval Air Station]] [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington (USA)]], but it was relocated to [[Naval Air Station North Island|NAS San Diego]], [[California|California (USA)]] in May 1945. VT-41 was assigned to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Escort Carrier Air Group 41 (CVEG-41)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (redesignated CVEG-1 in 1946). After working up of the squadron in the late stages of the [[Second World War]], the Commander Air Force Pacific Fleet designated anti-submarine warfare as the primary mission of VT-41 in March 1946. On 15 November 1946 VT-41 became VA-1E, which was translated into &amp;quot;1st attack squadron (&amp;quot;VA-1&amp;quot;) based on escort carriers (&amp;quot;E&amp;quot;)&amp;quot;. On 4 December 1946, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Escort Carrier Air Group 1 (CVEG-1)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was assigned to the escort carrier [[USS Badoeng Strait (CVE-116)|USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Badoeng Strait&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], and VA-1E was identified by the tail code &amp;quot;BS&amp;quot; (call sign &amp;quot;Beef Steak&amp;quot;). In 1947-48 VA-1E conducted regular ASW exercises aboard the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Badoeng Strait&amp;apos;&amp;apos; between the U.S. West Coast and the [[Pacific ocean|Western Pacific]]. The squadron saw extensive service in ASW trials and tactics development aboard the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Badoeng Strait&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. When the U.S. Navy turned back to the designation system used before November 1946, both CVEG-1 squadrons VA-1E and VF-1E were merged into &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Composite Squadron 21 (VC-21)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and VA-1E and VF-1E were disestablished on 1 September 1948. VC-21 was one of six new anti-submarine squadrons. It was redesignated &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anti-Submarine Squadron 21 (VS-21)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on 23 April 1950, and [[Sea Control Squadron 21|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sea Control Squadron 21 (VS-21)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] on 1 October 1993. VS-21 was finally disestablished on 28 February 2005.
