&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Udo Proksch&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (May 29, 1934 ([[Rostock]], [[Germany]]) &amp;amp;ndash; June 27, 2001 ([[Graz]], [[Austria]])) was an [[Austria]]n businessman and industrialist. In 1991, he was convicted of the murder of six people as part of a major [[insurance fraud]]. Proksch died in prison.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Club 45 in Vienna: https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/dspace/bitstream/1887/4551/12/04.pdf (Page 13)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1977, the ship &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Lucona]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sank in the [[Indian Ocean]], after an explosion, killing six people. Proksch, the owner of the cargo, also then owner of famous Viennese confectioners&amp;apos; [[Demel]], claimed [[USD|US$]]20 million from his insurance company, saying that the ship was carrying expensive [[uranium]] [[mining]] equipment. In 1990, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lucona&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was located by American shipwreck hunter [[David Mearns]], revealing that the ship had been sunk by a [[time bomb]]. Fraud was suspected; but investigations were obstructed by powerful Austrian politicians, who were friends of Proksch.

Several ex-Ministers were eventually convicted over their involvement. The ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs was sentenced for forging documents authenticating the cargo. Two other Ministers were dismissed for obstructing the investigations. The Minister of Defense, a shareholder in the Proksch firm, had given permission to deliver explosives to sabotage the ship and committed suicide when that became clear.

In 1988, Proksch fled to the [[Philippines]] after [[Hans Pretterebner]] published a book about the scandal. Proksch stayed at the palace of his personal friend, the dictator [[Ferdinand Marcos]].{{Clarify|date=May 2012}}

In 1989, he returned to [[Vienna]], incognito, but was recognized and arrested. On March 11, 1991, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. A year later, the sentence was increased to a lifelong term in prison. He died on June 27, 2001, during heart surgery.

Proksch was the first husband of the actress Daphne Wagner, daughter of [[Wieland Wagner]], great-granddaughter of the composer [[Richard Wagner]] and great-great-granddaughter of [[Franz Liszt]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
