&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sverdlovsk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-uk|Свердловськ}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sverdlovs’k&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; {{lang-ru|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Свердловск&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}) is a [[city]] in [[Luhansk Oblast]] ([[Oblast|province]]) of south-eastern [[Ukraine]]. Serving as the [[Capital city|administrative center]] of [[Sverdlovskyi Raion]] ([[raion|district]]), the city itself is also designated as a separate [[raion]] within the [[oblast]], and is located approximately 80&amp;amp;nbsp;km from the oblast capital, [[Luhansk]].

The current estimated population is around 72,531 (as of 2001). Most of the city residents work in the [[mining]] industry.

==History==
The city tracks its roots from a small village in the headstream of [[Dolzhyk River]]. At the end of the 18th century, it was granted by [[Catherine II of Russia]] to [[ataman]] [[Vasyl Orlov]] as a reward for his excellent military service. The farmland took on the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dolzhykovo-Orlovske&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Development of the area significantly expanded towards the end of the 19th century, after the discovery of [[coal]] in the [[Donbass|Donetsk region]]. In 1938 the settlement received [[city]] status and its current name in memory of the [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Yakov Sverdlov]].
