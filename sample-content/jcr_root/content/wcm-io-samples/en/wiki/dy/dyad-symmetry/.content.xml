        text="&lt;p&gt;In [[genetics]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;dyad symmetry&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refers to two areas of a [[DNA]] strand whose base pair sequences are [[inverted repeat]]s of each other. They are often described as [[palindromes]].

For example, the following shows dyad symmetry between sequences GAATAC and GTATTC which are reverse complements of each other.
&amp;lt;source lang=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;&amp;gt;...GAATAC...CTG...GTATTC...&amp;lt;/source&amp;gt;

==Involvement in transcription==
Since the two reverse complementary sequences will fold and base-pair with each other, the sequence of bases between them form a [[hairpin loop]]. This structure is thought to destabilize the binding of RNA polymerase enzyme to DNA (hence terminating transcription). Dyad symmetry is known to have a role in the rho independent method of transcription termination in E. coli. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Regions of dyad symmetry in the DNA sequence stall the RNA polymerase enzyme as it transcribes them.

==Involvement in prophage integration==
Temperate [[bacteriophage]]s integrate into the host genome at specific interrupted dyad symmetry sequences using the phage encoded enzyme integrase (see [[Lambda_phage#Prophage_integration|prophage integration]]).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Bacteriophages&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Richard Calendar (2006) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Bacteriophages&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Oxford University Press, Oxford, NY) ISBN 0-19-514850-9, page 67&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
