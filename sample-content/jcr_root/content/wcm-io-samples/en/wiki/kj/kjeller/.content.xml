&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kjeller&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a village located near [[Lillestrøm]] in the municipality of [[Skedsmo]], [[Norway]]. It is located 25 kilometers north of [[Oslo]].

==The name==
The [[Norse language|Norse]] form of the name was probably &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tjaldir&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This is then the [[plural]] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;tjald&amp;apos;&amp;apos; n &amp;apos;[[tent]]&amp;apos;. The hills around the farm (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kjellerhaugen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and others) might have been compared in form with tents.

==Facilities==
Kjeller contains:

*[[Kjeller Airport]]
*Norwegian Defence Logistic Organization (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;FLO&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)
*The Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;FFI&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)
*The [[Institute for Energy Technology]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;IFE&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), including one of Norway&amp;apos;s two nuclear research reactors.
*[[Norwegian Institute for Air Research]]
*The Norwegian Standardisation Bureau
*[[UNIK]] (University Graduate Center)
*[[Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences]]
*[[NORSAR]] (Norwegian Seismic Array)

Historically, Kjeller has also been the location for a small [[aircraft]] factory. The [[Telenor]] Research Centre was located in Kjeller until 2001, when the majority of employees moved to [[Fornebu]] on 23 November. Akershus University College was opened in autumn 2003 at Telenor&amp;apos;s previous location. Approximately 3700 students attend the university.

===Nuclear reactor===
The nuclear reactor at Kjeller, opened on November 28, 1951 was the first reactor outside the [[United States|US]], [[Soviet Union]], [[Canada]], [[Great Britain]] and [[France]]. It was a joint project by the Dutch and Norwegian governments. The Netherlands supplied the uranium and Norway the [[heavy water]]. The nuclear reactor is used in scientific research and is together with a nuclear reactor in [[Halden]] Norway&amp;apos;s only two nuclear reactors. Neither of them is in commercial use.

On 9 September 2006, the reactor suffered a &amp;quot;contained&amp;quot; leak which forced it to shut down for three weeks for repairs.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/09/09/norway.nuclear.ap/ www.cnn.com September 9, 2006]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070909190942/http://www.ife.no/ife_news/2006/hendelsen_2006-09-20-funnet_feil/view?set_language=en&amp;amp;cl=en www.ife.no September 20, 2006]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.blather.net/north/archives/2007/09/can_someone_please_explain_the_kjeller_i.html www.blather.net September 2007]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
