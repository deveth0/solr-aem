[[File:Kjell Aukrust - 1965.jpg|thumb|Aukrust in 1965]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kjell Aukrust&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (19 March 1920 – 24 December 2002) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] author, poet and artist.

He was born in [[Alvdal]] as a son of [[Lars Olsen Aukrust]] (1886–1965) and Louise Walmsnæss (1887–1973). He was a nephew of [[Olav Aukrust]], brother of [[Odd Aukrust]], a noted economist who was responsible for research at [[Statistics Norway]], and first cousin of [[Tor Aukrust]]. He was married to Kari Holter since 1947.&amp;lt;ref name=nbl&amp;gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Kjell Aukrust|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Finn|last=Jor|authorlink=Finn Jor|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Kjell_Aukrust/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He is most famous for his memoirs of his childhood in Alvdal in the books &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Simen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bonden&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bror Min&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and his creation of the fictional Norwegian village of Flåklypa and its cast of idiosyncratic characters. This setting was the basis of the 1975 [[Stop motion|animated]] film &amp;quot;[[Flåklypa Grand Prix]]&amp;quot;, directed by [[Ivo Caprino]]. The film was the first full length animated feature in Norway, became an international success and has been translated into more than seventy languages. In Britain it is known as &amp;quot;Pinchcliffe Grand Prix&amp;quot;. The protagonist Reodor Felgen (English version: Theodore Rimspoke) has become synonymous in Norway with [[Rube Goldberg]] type contraptions.

Some of the characters who populated the village of Pinchcliffe were also the basis for the first full length handdrawn animated feature in Norway, &amp;quot;Solan, Ludvig og Gurin med reverompa&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166350/|title=Gurin with the Foxtail on IMDB|publisher=IMDB}} {{no icon}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Released in 1998, this movie takes place in [[Oslo]] and [[Alvdal]]. In Britain it is known as &amp;quot;Gurin with the Foxtail&amp;quot;.
