In his early astronomical career, he studied [[variable star]]s and in particular close [[eclipsing binary]] stars. He attended [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1938&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58794.html}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and later that year he went to [[Harvard College Observatory]]. After the war he became head of the astronomy department at the [[University of Manchester]]. He later assisted [[NASA]] with the [[Apollo program]] as an external expert.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; He was Editor-in-Chief of the journal [[Astrophysics and Space Science]] since its foundation in 1968 until his death in 1993.
