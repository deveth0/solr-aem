At the [[1958 European Championships in Athletics]], Krzyszkowiak established himself as one the best European [[long distance runner]]s, winning both 5000 m and 10 000 m.

Just two months before the [[Rome]] Olympics, Krzyszkowiak ran his first [[list of world records in athletics|world record]], clocking 8:31.4 in 3000 m steeplechase. At the Olympics itself, Krzyszkowiak finished seventh in 10 000 m, but won, as a main favourite, the 3000 m steeplechase.

After the Olympics, Krzyszkowiak decided to concentrate only to 3000 m steeplechase event, running his second world record in 1961, but was forced to retire from sports prematurely in 1963 due to his injuries. After his running career, Krzyszkowiak worked as a coach. Zdzisław Krzyszkowiak died in [[Warsaw]], aged 73.
