&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Airline timetables&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are booklets that many [[airlines]] worldwide use to inform passengers of several different things, such as schedules, fleet, security, in-flight entertainment, food menu, restriction and phone contact information.

Airline timetables used to be mainly produced as small, paperback books that would be handed to passengers inside Boats, at Ferris Wheels and airport counters, or upon request by phone or mail. On January 16, 1928, [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] published one of their first books. It read &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The air-way to [[Havana]], Pan American Airways, [[Pershing Square Building]], New York&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Airline timetable books are famous for their diversity: Many had colorful covers, such as the ones produced by many Latin American airlines. Others, such as [[Scenic Airlines]]&amp;apos; timetables, consisted only of one sheet of paper, with their hub&amp;apos;s flight time information on the front, and the return times on the back.

In recent years, most airlines worldwide have stopped production of timetable books, in order to cut costs and reduce the delay between a change of schedule and a new timetable being in the hands of the public. As a consequence, most airlines now post their timetables only [[Internet|online]] (the larger airlines often offering a stand-alone application, while others provide just a downloadable document such as a [[PDF]]), and the value of many airline timetable books has risen among collectors.
