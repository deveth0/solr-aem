        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aida D. Fariscal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1940? - ) is a former police officer and watch commander in the [[Manila]] Police Department in the [[Philippines]]. She is now a retired grandmother living on pension in a one bedroom apartment. Her name is largely unknown outside of the [[Philippines]]. She was depicted in the 2006 [[docudrama]] [[The Path to 9/11]], although by a much younger actress. An actress portrays her in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Mayday (TV series)|Mayday]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Air Emergency&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Air Crash Investigation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) episode &amp;quot;Bomb on Board.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Bomb on Board.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Mayday (TV series)|Mayday]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Fariscal spent seventeen years as a homemaker before enrolling in the police department in 1977. The widow of a slain police officer, she rose through the ranks of the Manila Police Department, and in 1983 won an award for arresting three murder suspects on [[Mindoro Island]].

==Antiterrorism==
On the night of January 6, 1995, she was suspicious about a small fire that went out unassisted at the DoÃ±a Josefa Apartments; her suspicions were augmented by a wave of bombings that hit [[Metro Manila]], and [[Philippine Airlines]] [[Philippine Airlines Flight 434|Flight 434]]. This led her to uncover a terrorist plot made by alleged [[Al Qaida]] agents named [[Operation Bojinka]].
She came to the apartment with a partner, looked around, and left after a telephone rang. She had to ask 11 judges to find one that would grant her a search warrant. She, along with a group of investigators and police then uncovered evidence, before arresting a suspect who called himself Ahmed Saeed.
She refused to let go of a suspect, who turned out to be [[Abdul Hakim Murad (terrorist)|Abdul Hakim Murad]], after he offered her 110,740 [[Philippine peso]]s ($2,000 [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]]).

Her decision to investigate the fire possibly saved thousands of lives, including possibly that of [[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]]. She received a monetary award of the equivalent of 33,222 pesos ($700) and a trip to [[Taiwan]] from the government. She also won a laminated award from the [[CIA]] for her action. The certificate reads, &amp;quot;Awarded to Senior Inspector Aida D. Fariscal, in recognition of your personal outstanding efforts and co-operation.&amp;quot;  After she foiled the plot, the Philippine police assigned her two bodyguards for five years. The bodyguard service ended shortly before September 11.
