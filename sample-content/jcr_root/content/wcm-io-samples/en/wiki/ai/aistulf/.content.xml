        text="&lt;p&gt;[[File:Aistulf follis 80000860.jpg|thumb|A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[follis]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of Aistulf]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aistulf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (died 756) was the [[Duke of Friuli]] from 744, King of [[Lombards]] from 749, and [[Duchy of Spoleto|Duke of Spoleto]] from 751. His father was the [[Pemmo of Friuli|Duke Pemmo]].

After his brother [[Ratchis]] became king, Aistulf succeeded him in Friuli. He succeeded him later as king when Ratchis abdicated to a monastery.  Aistulf continued the policy of expansion and raids against the [[papacy]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[exarchate of Ravenna]]. In 751, he captured [[Ravenna]] itself and even threatened [[Rome]], claiming a [[head tax|capitation tax]]. he also conquered [[Istria]] region from Byzantines in same year.

The popes, thoroughly irritated and alarmed, and hopeless of aid from the Byzantine Emperor, turned to the [[Carolingian]] [[mayors of the palaces|mayors of the palace]] of [[Austrasia]], the effective rulers of the [[Franks|Frankish kingdom]]. In 741, [[Pope Gregory III]] asked [[Charles Martel]] to intervene, but he was too busy elsewhere and declined. In 753, [[Pope Stephen II]] visited Charles Martel&amp;apos;s son [[Pepin the Short|Pippin the Short]], who had been proclaimed king of the Franks in 751 with the consent of [[Pope Zachary]]. In gratitude for the papal consent to his coronation, Pippin crossed the [[Alps]], defeated Aistulf, and gave to the pope the lands which Aistulf had torn from the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ducatus Romanus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the exarchate ([[Emilia-Romagna]] and the [[Pentapolis]]).

Aistulf died hunting in 756. He was succeeded by [[Desiderius]] as king of the Lombards and by [[Alboin of Spoleto|Alboin]] as duke of [[Spoleto]]. He had given Friuli to his brother-in-law [[Anselm, Duke of Friuli|Anselm]], abbot of [[Nonantula]], whose sister Gisaltruda he had married, when he succeeded to the kingship in 749.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web
