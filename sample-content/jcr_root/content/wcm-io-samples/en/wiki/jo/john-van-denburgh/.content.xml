[[File:Van Denburgh John 1872-1924.png|thumb|230px|right|John Van Denburgh.]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Van Denburgh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (August 23, 1872 - 1924) was a [[United States|U.S.]] [[herpetologist]] from [[California]].

He was born in [[San Francisco]] and enrolled at [[Stanford University]] in 1891. As of 1895, he organized the herpetology department of the [[California Academy of Sciences]]. In 1897 he got a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from Stanford University. Additionally, he got an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] in 1902 and subsequently practiced medicine in San Francisco, while again serving as curator of the herpetological collections of the California Academy of Sciences.

After the [[San Francisco earthquake of 1906]] he was instrumental in rebuilding the lost herpetology collections through new expeditions and also acquisitions of other collections. In 1922, he published the two-volume &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Reptiles of Western North America&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

He died in 1924 while on vacation in [[Hawaii]].
