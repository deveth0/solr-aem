&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Easton Mills&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (October 1796 &amp;amp;ndash; November 12, 1847) served briefly as [[mayor of Montreal]], [[Quebec]].

In March 1846, Montreal city council deadlocked on the choice of a mayor.  Mills had ten votes, and incumbent mayor [[James Ferrier (Canadian senator)|James Ferrier]] had nine, but Ferrier voted for himself twice, in accordance with existing rules.  Municipal paralysis ensued until December 1846, when Mills was elected decisively.

==Typhus outbreak==
{{Main|Goose Village, Montreal#Typhus epidemic}}
In 1847 there was a major outbreak of [[typhus]] in Montreal among [[Ireland|Irish]] immigrants.  Mills organized measures to contain the epidemic and volunteered to tend to the sick, whereupon he contracted the disease himself and died after less than one year in office.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Bruemmer&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://montrealnewsinfo.blogspot.com/2009/05/seeking-hope-they-found-death.html|title=Seeking hope, they found death|last=Bruemmer|first=Rene|date=2009-05-30|work=Montreal Gazette|publisher=Canwest|accessdate=2009-05-30}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
