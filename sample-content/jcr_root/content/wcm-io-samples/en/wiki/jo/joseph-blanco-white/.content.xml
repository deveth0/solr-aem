&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Joseph Blanco White&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;José María Blanco Crespo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (11 July 1775 – 20 May 1841), was a Spanish [[theology|theologian]] and poet.

White was born in [[Seville]], Spain.  He had Irish ancestry and was the son of the merchant Guillermo Blanco (alias White, an English viceconsul who had  established itself in Seville during the reign of Fernando VI) and María Gertrudis Crespo y Neve.

White was educated for the Roman Catholic priesthood but, after his ordination in 1800, religious doubts led him to escape from Spain to England (1810). There he ultimately entered the [[Anglican Church]], having studied theology at Oxford and made the friendship of [[Thomas Arnold]], [[John Henry Newman]] and [[Richard Whately]]. He became tutor in Whately&amp;apos;s family when Whately became the  Archbishop of [[Dublin]] in 1831. While in this position White embraced Unitarian views and he found an asylum amongst the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] of [[Liverpool]], and he died in the city on 20 May 1841.

White edited &amp;apos;&amp;apos;El Español&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a monthly Spanish magazine in London, from 1810 to 1814.  Afterwards he received a civil list pension of £250. His principal writings are &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Doblado&amp;apos;s Letters from Spain&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1822) (under the pseudonym of &amp;quot;Don Leucado Doblado&amp;quot;, and written in part at [[Holland House, London|Holland House]] in London&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=Holland House|author=Princess Marie Liechtenstein|year=1875|edition=3|page=91|chapter=IV, The Third and the Fourth Lord Holland|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL25199401M/Holland_house|accessdate=2012-08-30}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Evidence against Catholicism&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1825), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Second Travels of an Irish Gentleman in Search of a Religion&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2 vols., 1834) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Observations on Heresy and Orthodoxy&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1835). They all show literary ability and were extensively read in their day. He also translated Paley&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Evidences&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Book of Common Prayer&amp;apos;&amp;apos; into Spanish.

White is best remembered, however, for his sonnet &amp;quot;Night and Death&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Mysterious Night! when our first parent knew&amp;quot;), which was dedicated to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] on its appearance in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bijou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for 1828 and has since found its way into several anthologies. Three versions are given in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Academy&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of 12 September 1891.
