        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John von Neumann Theory Prize&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the [[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences]]
is awarded annually to an individual (or sometimes a group) who has made fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in [[operations research]] and the management sciences.

The Prize named after mathematician [[John von Neumann]] is awarded for a body of work, rather than a single piece. The Prize was intended to reflect contributions that have stood the test of time. The criteria include significance, innovation, depth, and scientific excellence.

The award is $5,000, a medallion and a citation.

The Prize has been awarded since 1975. The first recipient was [[George Dantzig|George B. Dantzig]] for his work on [[linear programming]].
