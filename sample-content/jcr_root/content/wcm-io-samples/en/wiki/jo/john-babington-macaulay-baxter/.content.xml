&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Babington Macaulay Baxter&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|PC}} (February 16, 1868 &amp;amp;ndash; December 27, 1946) was a [[New Brunswick]] lawyer, jurist and the [[List of premiers of New Brunswick|19th]] [[Premier of New Brunswick|Premier of the Canadian Province of New Brunswick]].

Baxter served in the [[Canadian Army]] and was the author of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Historical Records of the New Brunswick Regiment, Royal Artillery&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the unit he commanded from 1907 to 1912. He also had a keen interest in [[genealogy]] and in 1943 the [[New Brunswick Museum]] published his book titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Simon Baxter - The first United Empire Loyalist to settle in New Brunswick, (Canada)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Born in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], John Baxter served on the municipal council for eighteen years from 1892 to 1910. A [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick|Conservative Party]] member, he was elected to the [[32nd New Brunswick Legislative Assembly]] in 1911. He was appointed [[Office of the Attorney General (New Brunswick)|Attorney-General]] of the province, holding that office from 1915 to 1917. He entered federal politics and served as [[Minister of National Revenue (Canada)|Minister of Customs and Excise]] under [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Arthur Meighen]] in 1921 before taking over the leadership of the provincial Conservative party and leading it to victory in 1925.

Baxter was a leader of the [[Maritime Rights Movement]] which expressed the discontent felt by the maritime provinces concerning their loss of influence in the [[Canadian confederation]] dominated by the provinces of [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]].

He left politics in 1931 and was appointed [[Chief Justice of New Brunswick|Chief Justice of the New Brunswick Supreme Court]] in 1935 serving until his death. His son, [[John B. M. Baxter, Jr.]], later served in the cabinet of [[Richard Hatfield]].
