&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Putnam Chapin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 21, 1810 &amp;amp;ndash; July 27, 1864; buried in [[Graceland Cemetery]]) served as [[Mayor of Chicago|Mayor]] of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]] (1846â€“1847) for the [[United States Whig Party|Whig Party]].

Chapin left his hometown to enter the mercantile business in [[Haverhill, New Hampshire]] before moving to Chicago in 1832.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;death&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news | title = Death of an Old Citizen | newspaper = Chicago Tribune | location = Chicago | date = 06-28-1864 | accessdate = 06-05-2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In Chicago he became a member of the wholesale and retail merchants firm Wadsworth, Dyer &amp;amp; Chapin until it was dissolved in 1843.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;death&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; Following the dissolution of the firm, Chapin joined the Canal Boat Transportation Company.

In 1846, Chapin ran for mayor of Chicago as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee Charles Follansbee and [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]] nominee Philo Carpenter, winning the office with just over 55% of the vote.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | last = Walker | first = Thomas | title = Chicago Mayor 1846 | work = Our Campaigns | date = 11-04-2008 | url = http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=486025 | accessdate = 06-05-2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Following his term as Mayor, Chapin was elected to the city council in 1859. In 1861, he was nominated by the Union ticket for the office of Commissioner of Public Works.  As Chapin was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he declined the nomination as he felt it was a mischievous move on the part of the Democrats.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;announcement&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news | last=Chapin | first=John Putnam | title = Important Announcement | newspaper = Chicago Tribune | location = Chicago | date = 04-12-1861 | accessdate = 06-05-2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
