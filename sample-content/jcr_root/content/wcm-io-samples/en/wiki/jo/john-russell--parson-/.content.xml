&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John &amp;quot;Jack&amp;quot; Russell&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (21 December 1795 â€“ 28 April 1883), known as &amp;quot;The Sporting Parson&amp;quot;, was an enthusiastic hunter and [[dog breeder]] as well as an ordained [[cleric]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parsonrussellterrierclub.co.uk/history.html |title=The Parson Russell Terrier Club, UK - Introduction to the breed |publisher=Parsonrussellterrierclub.co.uk |date= |accessdate=13 April 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Russell was born in [[Dartmouth, England]], the eldest son of John Russell and Nora (Jewell).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;biog464&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Stephen|first=Leslie|title=Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=New York Macmillan|year=1885|page=464}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was educated at [[Plympton Grammar School]], [[Blundell&amp;apos;s School]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blundells.org/admin/school_notable-obs.htm#18thc |title=Famous OBs |publisher=www.blundells.org |date= |accessdate=13 April 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and [[Exeter College, Oxford]].  It was at Exeter College, legend has it, that he spotted a little white [[terrier]] dog with dark tan spots over her eyes, ears and at the tip of her tail, who was owned by a milkman.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jack-russell-terrier.co.uk/breed/history_of_the_breed.html |title=A brief history of the Jack Russell - Jack Russell Terrier UK |publisher=Jack-russell-terrier.co.uk |date= |accessdate=13 April 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Russell bought the dog on the spot and this animal, called &amp;quot;Trump&amp;quot;, became the foundation dog of a line of [[fox hunting]] terriers that would eventually come to be known as [[Jack Russell Terrier]]s.  Russell came to live in a village called [[Swimbridge]] in North Devon.  After his death, the local [[public house]]  was renamed the Jack Russell Inn; it still stands today.

Russell was a founding member of [[The Kennel Club]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://dogwebs.net/PlentifulRun/aboutus.asp |title=Plentiful Run Parson Russell Terriers - About Us |publisher=Dogwebs.net |date= |accessdate=13 April 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  He helped to write the [[breed standard]] for the [[Fox Terrier (Smooth)]] and became a respected judge.  He did not show his own [[Fox Terrier|fox terrier]]s on the [[Conformation show|conformation]] bench, saying that the difference between his dogs and the conformation dogs could be likened to the difference between wild and cultivated flowers.
