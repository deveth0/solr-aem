&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Daniel Morell&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (June 18, 1816 - April 1, 1891), [[United Kingdom|British]] [[educationalist]], was born at Little Baddow, [[Essex]], where his father was minister of the Congregational church (1799-1852).

Morell proceeded to [[Independent College, Homerton|Homerton College]] in 1833, where he studied theology under [[John Pye Smith]]. He then entered the [[University of Glasgow]], where he took his M.A. degree in 1841. Subsequently he studied [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] under [[Immanuel Hermann Fichte|Fichte]] at [[university of Bonn|Bonn]], and returned to England to undertake the pastorate of the Congregational church at [[Gosport]].

After three years work, Morell decided to give up the ministry in favor of philosophical work. As early as 1846 he made his name by his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Historical and Critical View of the Speculative Philosophy of Europe in the Nineteenth Century&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which brought him to the notice of [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], who made him an inspector of schools. From 1848 till 1876 he was active in this capacity.

As a result of his experience he published numerous educational works, e.g.:
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Analysis of Sentences&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1852)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Essentials of English Grammar and Analysis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1855)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Handbook of Logic&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1855)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grammar of the English Language&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1857)
He also published four lectures on:
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Philosophical Tendencies of the Age&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1848)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Philosophy of Religion&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1849)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fichte&amp;apos;s Contributions to Moral Philosophy&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1860)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Philosophical Fragments&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1878)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;An Introduction to Mental Philosophy on the Inductive Method&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1884).
