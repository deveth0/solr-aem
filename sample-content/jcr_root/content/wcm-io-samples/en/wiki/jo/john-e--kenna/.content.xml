&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Edward Kenna&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 10, 1848{{spaced ndash}}January 11, 1893) was an [[United States|American]] politician who was a [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[West Virginia]] from 1883 until his death.

Kenna was born near [[St. Albans, West Virginia]], in [[Kanawha County, West Virginia|Kanawha County]] and lived his early life at [[Upper Falls, West Virginia|Upper Falls]], where his father was [[Lock keeper|lockmaster]] and owned a [[sawmill]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Courtesy of Dr. William H. Dean, Ph.D. From &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Coal, Steamboats, Timber and Trains: The Early Industrial History of St. Albans, West Virginia &amp;amp; The Coal River, 1850-1925&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. [http://upperfallswv.blog.com/] UpperFallsWV.blog.com&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He had little education, and at the age of 16 he served in the [[Shelby&amp;apos;s Iron Brigade|&amp;quot;Iron Brigade&amp;quot;]] with General [[Joseph O. Shelby]] in the [[Confederate States Army]] and was wounded. After returning home, he [[read law]] and was admitted to the bar in 1870. He became very active in the emerging [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] of West Virginia.

He rose from prosecuting attorney of Kanawha County in 1872 to Justice &amp;apos;&amp;apos;pro tempore&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the county circuit in 1875, and to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1876. While in the House he championed [[railroad]] legislation and crusaded for aid for slack-water navigation to help the coal, timber, and salt industries in his state. These activities earned him a seat in the [[United States Senate]] in 1883, where he continued fighting for his two causes.

Kenna became Democratic [[United States Senate Minority Leader|minority leader]] and emerged as a powerful and controversial speaker on the issue of the independence of the executive branch of the government. He forcefully defended President [[Grover Cleveland]] on several issues and indicted the Senate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] majority for failure to pass tariff reforms. His brilliant career was cut short with his sudden death at the age of 44 on January 11, 1893.

In 1901, the state of West Virginia donated a marble statue of Kenna to the [[U.S. Capitol]]&amp;apos;s [[National Statuary Hall Collection]].
