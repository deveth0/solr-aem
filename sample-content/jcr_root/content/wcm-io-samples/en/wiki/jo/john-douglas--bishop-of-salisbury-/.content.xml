&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Douglas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (14 July 1721 â€“ 18 May 1807) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] scholar and [[Anglican]] [[bishop]].

Douglas was born at [[Pittenweem]], [[Fife]], the son of a shopkeeper, and was educated at [[Dunbar]], [[East Lothian]], and at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he took his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|MA]] degree in 1743.

As [[chaplain]] to the [[3rd Regiment of Foot Guards]], he was at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]], 1745. He then returned to Balliol as a [[Snell Exhibitioner]]; became Vicar of [[High Ercall]], [[Shropshire]] in 1750; [[Dean and Canons of Windsor|Canon]] of the Eleventh Stall at [[St George&amp;apos;s Chapel, Windsor]] in 1762 (to 1776); a member of the chapter of [[St Paul&amp;apos;s Cathedral]] in 1777; [[Bishop of Carlisle]] in 1787 (and also [[Dean of Windsor]] in 1788); and [[Bishop of Salisbury]] in 1791. Other honours were the degree of [[Doctor of Divinity|DD]] (1758), and those of Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]].

Douglas was not an outstanding churchman.  He preferred to stay in [[London]] in winter and at fashionable watering places in summer. Under the patronage of the [[Earl of Bath]] he entered into several literary controversies.  He defended [[John Milton]] against [[William Lauder (forger)|William Lauder]]&amp;apos;s charge of [[plagiarism]] (1750), and attacked [[David Hume]]&amp;apos;s [[rationalism]] in his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Letter on the Criterion of Miracles]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1754); he went on to criticise the followers of [[John Hutchinson (writer)|John Hutchinson]] in his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Apology for the Clergy]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1755). He also edited [[James Cook|Captain Cook]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Journals&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Diary&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Letters&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1763). A volume of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Miscellaneous Works&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; prefaced by a short biography, was published posthumously in 1820.
