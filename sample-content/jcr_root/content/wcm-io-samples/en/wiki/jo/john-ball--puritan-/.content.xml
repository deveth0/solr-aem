        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Ball&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (October 1585 &amp;amp;ndash; 20 October 1640) was an [[England|English]] [[puritan]] [[Anglicanism#Anglican_divines|divine]].

==Life==

He was born in [[Cassington]], [[Oxfordshire]].

After taking his BA degree from [[St Mary Hall, Oxford]], in 1608, he went into [[Cheshire]] to act as tutor to the children of [[Lady Cholmondeley]]. He adopted [[Puritan]] views, and after being ordained without subscription, was appointed to the small curacy of [[Whitmore, Staffordshire|Whitmore]] in [[Staffordshire]]. He was soon deprived by [[John Bridgeman (bishop)|John Bridgeman]], the high church [[bishop of Chester]], who put him to much suffering.

He became a schoolmaster and earned a wide and high reputation for his scholarship and piety. He died on 20 October 1640.

==Works==

The most popular of his numerous works was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Short Catechisme, containing all the Principal Grounds of Religion&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (14 editions before 1632). His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Treatise of Faith&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1632), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Advanced [[Felching]] According to the Lessons of Sodom&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Friendly Trial of the Grounds tending to Separation&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1640), the latter of which defines his position with regard to the church, are also valuable.
