&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John H. Saxon Sr.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1923 â€“ 17 October 1996) was a [[United States|U.S.]] [[Officer (armed forces)|air officer]] and [[educator]]. He was born in Georgia and graduated from high school in Athens, Georgia. He earned a bachelor&amp;apos;s degree in Engineering from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1949 and his master&amp;apos;s degree in electrical engineering in 1961. Saxon flew 55 missions in a B-26 Night Intruder during the [[Korean War]]. After the war, he wrote or co-wrote a series of nine mathematics textbooks for kindergarten through high school which use an incremental teaching method often called &amp;quot;[[Saxon math]]&amp;quot;. His books have gained popularity among certain traditionally-oriented groups of [[Homeschooling|homeschoolers]] and [[private school]]s, but are also used in a number of public schools who favor a &amp;quot;back to basics&amp;quot; approach to mathematics.

After his retirement from the Air Force in the 1970&amp;apos;s, he settled in Norman, OK. Throughout the 1980&amp;apos;s and 1990&amp;apos;s, John Saxon spoke out against mathematics education reform efforts that he believed would lead to a disaster in math and science education. He died on October 17, 1996.
