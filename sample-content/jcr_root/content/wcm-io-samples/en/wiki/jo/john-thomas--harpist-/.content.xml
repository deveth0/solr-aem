&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Thomas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1 March 1826 &amp;amp;ndash; 19 March 1913) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[composer]] and [[harp]]ist. The [[bardic name]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pencerdd Gwalia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Chief of the Welsh minstrels) was conferred on him at the 1861 [[Aberdare]] Eisteddfod.&amp;lt;ref name=Grove&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grove&amp;apos;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 5th ed., 1954&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Life==
He was born in Bridgend, on [[Saint David&amp;apos;s Day]], 1 March 1826, son of a tailor, also named John Thomas, a clarinetist in the amateur town band. He was the eldest of seven children, four of whom also played the harp, most notably his brother [[Thomas Thomas (harpist)|Thomas Thomas]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.adlaismusicpublishers.co.uk/pages/harpists/john_thomas.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; John Thomas started off by playing the [[triple harp]] which had three sets of strings and was very difficult to play. At the age of 14, through the influence of [[Ada Lovelace]] ([[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]]&amp;apos;s daughter), he was admitted to the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in [[London]]. His teachers there included [[Cipriani Potter]] for composition.&amp;lt;ref name=Grove/&amp;gt;

He taught at the [[Royal College of Music]], where he eventually became professor, and at the [[Guildhall School of Music]].

He wrote many pieces for the harp that are very popular today and are used in the exam syllabus.  He also wrote an opera, a symphony, two harp concertos, overtures, chamber music, and two cantatas – &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Llewellyn&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1863) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Bride of Neath Valley&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1866).  He played one of his own harp concertos at a Philharmonic concert in 1852.&amp;lt;ref name=Grove/&amp;gt;

In 1861, he was briefly engaged to the [[Belgian people|Belgian]] soprano [[Désirée Artôt]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.creightonscollection.co.uk/index.html?Pages/Albums/A0126-CD.htm~mainFrame Creighton’s collection]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1872 he was appointed harpist to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].&amp;lt;ref name=Grove/&amp;gt;
