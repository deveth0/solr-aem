&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Drew&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (September 3, 1827 â€“ May 21, 1862) was an [[Irish-American]] stage actor and theatre manager.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://asp6new.alexanderstreet.com/atho/atho.detail.people.aspx?personcode=per0044129 John Drew, Sr.: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;North American Theatre Online&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Early life==
Born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jonathan Henry Drewland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], to Thomas L. Drew and Louise Kanten, he was the fifth of six children. He lived in [[Templeogue]], a poor Irish village in County Dublin during the 19th century. In 1832, John Drew emigrated to the [[United States]] with his family to Boston, Massachusetts. As a child he spent most of his life living in Boston. This is where he first got into acting.

==Career==
After moving to the [[United States]], Drew got a job in the theatrical company of Joseph J. Johlen (the theatre manager). He appeared in a number of Johlen&amp;apos;s plays, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Uncle Mutch&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Barber Man&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Canterbury of Livingston&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Progrist&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Drew made his first [[New York]] appearance in 1846. He played [[Ireland|Irish]] and light [[comedy]] parts with success in many American cities, and was the manager of the Arch Street Theatre.

==Personal life==
John married [[Louisa Lane Drew|Louisa Lane]] in 1848 this being her third marriage and his first. They had three children, Louisa (b. 1852-1888), [[John Drew Jr.|John Jr.]] (b. 1853-1927), and [[Georgiana Drew|Georgiana]] (b. 1856-1893), the latter two of whom were accomplished actors. (Georgiana married [[Maurice Barrymore]] in 1876, begetting the [[Barrymore family]]; this makes John Drew a great-great-grandfather of actress [[Drew Barrymore]].)

Drew died at his home in [[Philadelphia]], at the early age of 34, after tripping &amp;amp; falling and fatally hitting his head during a party for daughter Georgiana. He was buried in Glenwood Cemetery in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], which was later closed and his body was moved to Mount Vernon Cemetery. After his death, his wife Louisa took over the management of the Arch Street Theatre.
