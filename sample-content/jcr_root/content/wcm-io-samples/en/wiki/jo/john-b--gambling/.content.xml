&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Bradley Gambling&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 9, 1897 – November 21, 1974) was an [[United States|American]] radio personality. He was a member of the [[The Gambling family]], 3 generations of whom - John B., [[John A. Gambling|John A.]] and [[John R. Gambling|John R.]] - were hosts of [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] Radio&amp;apos;s ([[New York City]], 710 AM) morning show &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Rambling with Gambling]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (now known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The John Gambling Show&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) over the course of over 75 years (1925–2000 and 2008–present).

John B. was the host from 1925 to 1959, when he retired in favor of his son, [[John A. Gambling]]. With his Musical Clock, his all-in-fun setting-up exercises, cheerio music, wheezy gags, weather information and news scraps, John B. Gambling was a WOR fixture. Once he was a British seaman on a World War I mine sweeper.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Time Magazine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, March 18, 1940&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

John Gambling had a band, and provided live music, including the March of the Seven Dwarfs every morning at 7 am sharp.

Gambling bought a home in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]] in 1929.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Staff.
