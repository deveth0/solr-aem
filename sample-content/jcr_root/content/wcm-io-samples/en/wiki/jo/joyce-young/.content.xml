        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Joyce Young&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born c. 1925) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] woman famous for a single act of [[philanthropy]]. She is the wife of Bill Young, a retired [[Major (Canada)|Major]] in the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] and the aunt of [[Red Hat|Red Hat, Inc.]] founder [[Bob Young (businessman)|Bob Young]].

==Early Life==
Bill Young graduated from [[Hillfield Strathallan College]] in 1935 and Joyce graduated from Hillfield in 1943. After graduating, Bill served in the Canadian military during [[World War II]], serving in [[England]], [[Italy]], and northwest Europe. The couple met after Bill returned from the war.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hillstrath.on.ca/news-room/publications/hillstrath-review/HSReview_Winter%202004.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071020133253/http://www.hillstrath.on.ca/news-room/publications/hillstrath-review/HSReview_Winter%202004.pdf |archivedate=October 20, 2007 |title=Deep Roots |publisher=Hillstrath Review |volume=4 |date=Fall 2004 |page=6}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Joyce left [[The University of Toronto]] to become a full-time home-maker. The couple have three children, Douglas, Catherine, and William.

==Red Hat, Inc.==

Young and her husband Bill Young, both residents of [[Ancaster, Ontario]],&amp;lt;ref name=jyoung&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hcf.on.ca/pages/news/newsarchive/2001/youngfund.htm |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930105411/http://www.hcf.on.ca/pages/news/newsarchive/2001/youngfund.htm |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |title=A Gift With Potential To Transform - The Young Fund |publisher=Hamilton Community Foundation News |date=Spring 2000}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; opted to help their nephew Bob with his high-tech venture shortly after its founding in 1993. Bob&amp;apos;s company, Red Hat, Inc., is one dedicated to open source software such as [[Red Hat Linux]], and the proprietary [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]].

When Red Hat&amp;apos;s stock rose significantly after its [[initial public offering]] in 1999, the elder Youngs were able to sell enough [[stock]] to recoup their initial investment, but chose to retain some stocks. Joyce was quoted as saying
{{quote|&amp;quot;While I respect Bob as a businessman, I quite honestly never thought I&amp;apos;d see my money again. I really just wanted to support him. After holding the company&amp;apos;s stock for three years, I took out my original investment, and left some money in just for fun.&amp;quot;}}

By January 2000, the remaining stock was valued in millions.  This enabled Joyce to make a donation of [[Canadian dollar|CAD$]]40 million in June 2000, to the [[Hamilton Community Foundation]]. The money was given for the purpose of improving [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]-area health facilities. This act that represented one of the largest charitable donations in Canadian history.  A long-time [[volunteer]] with local community groups, she later stated her biggest concern was in giving away the money responsibly.
