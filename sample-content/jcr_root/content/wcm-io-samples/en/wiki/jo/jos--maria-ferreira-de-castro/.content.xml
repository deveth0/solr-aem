&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;José Maria Ferreira de Castro&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Oliveira de Azeméis]], May 24, 1898 &amp;amp;ndash; [[Oporto]], June 29, 1974) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] writer and journalist.

At age 12, he immigrated to [[Brazil]], where his work at a rubber plantation for the next four years would be the inspiration for his most famous book, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Selva&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1930), which was adapted for a 2002 film of the same title (released in English as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Forest (2002 film)|The Forest]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

He returned to Portugal in 1919, and started working as a journalist. He was a noted oppositionist to [[António de Oliveira Salazar]].

He was also famous for his travel literature, namely his book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Volta ao Mundo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, recounting his travels around the world in the outset of [[World War II]].
