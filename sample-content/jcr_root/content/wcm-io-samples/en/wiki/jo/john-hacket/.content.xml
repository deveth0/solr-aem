[[Image:JohnHacket.jpg|thumb|Bishop Hacket.]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Hacket&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1592â€“1670) was an [[England|English]] churchman, [[Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry]] from 1661 until his death.

==Life==

He was born in [[London]] and educated at [[Westminster School|Westminster]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Venn|id=HKT609J|name=Hackett, John}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; On taking his degree he was elected a fellow of his college, and soon afterwards wrote the [[comedy]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Loiola&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (London, 1648), which was twice performed before King [[James I of England|James I]]. He was ordained in 1618, and through the influence of [[John Williams (archbishop)|John Williams]] became rector in 1621 of Stoke Hammond, [[Buckinghamshire]], and Kirkby Underwood, [[Lincolnshire]].

In 1623 he was chaplain to James, and in 1624 Williams gave him the livings of St Andrew&amp;apos;s, Holborn, and [[Cheam|Cheam, Surrey]]. He was [[Archdeacon of Bedford]] from 1631 to 1661.

When the so-called [[Root and Branch Bill]] was before [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in 1641, Hacket was selected to plead in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] for the continuance of cathedral establishments. In 1645 his living of St Andrew&amp;apos;s was sequestered, but he was allowed to retain the rectory of Cheam.

On the accession of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], his fortunes improved; he frequently preached before the king, and in 1661 was consecrated [[Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry]]. His time at the Cathedral coming immediately after the [[English Civil War]] meant that Hacket had the unenviable task of overseeing the restoration of [[Lichfield Cathedral]].

There is an effigy in remembrance of Bishop Hacket in Lichfield Cathedral.

==Works==

His best-known book is the biography of his patron, Archbishop Williams, entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Scrinia reserata: a Memorial offered to the great Deservings of John Williams, D.D.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (London, 1693).
