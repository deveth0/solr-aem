&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Johan Torkel Håstad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 19 November 1960) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Computer science|theoretical computer scientist]] most known for his work on [[computational complexity theory]]. He was the recipient of the [[Gödel Prize]] in 1994 and 2011 and the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Doctoral Dissertation Award in 1986, among other prizes. He is a [[professor]] in [[theoretical computer science]] at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden since 1992. He is a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] since 2001.

He received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[Mathematics]] at [[Stockholm University]] in 1981, his [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in Mathematics at [[Uppsala University]] in 1984 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Mathematics from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1986.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=79819}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=4220823&amp;amp;srt=all&amp;amp;aw=146&amp;amp;ao=DOCDISRT Johan Håstad&amp;apos;s ACM doctoral dissertation award]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Håstad&amp;apos;s thesis and [[Gödel Prize]] (1994) concerned his work on [[lower bound]]s on the size of constant-depth [[Boolean circuits]] for the [[parity function]].  After [[Andrew Yao]] proved that such circuits require exponential size, Håstad proved nearly optimal lower bounds on the necessary size through his [[switching lemma]], which became an important technical tool in [[Boolean function complexity]].

He received the 2011 Gödel Prize for his work on optimal inapproximability results. In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-01-19.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
