&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John II of Jerusalem&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1259 or ca. 1267 &amp;amp;ndash; [[Nicosia]], 20 May 1285) was the eldest son of [[Hugh III of Cyprus]] and Isabella of Ibelin. He succeeded his father as [[Kingdom of Cyprus|King of Cyprus]] (as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John I&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) on March 24 and was crowned at [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Santa Sophia]], [[Nicosia]] on May 11, 1284. His succession as [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]] was opposed by [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]], who had also disrupted his father&amp;apos;s succession. John died the following year on 20 May, having never married and leaving no children. He was buried in the church of [[St. Demetrius]] or according to some [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Santa Sophia]], in [[Nicosia]]. According to some authors he was poisoned by his brothers, one of whom, [[Henry II of Cyprus|Henry II]], succeeded him in Cyprus and [[Jerusalem]]. He died unmarried and without issue.
