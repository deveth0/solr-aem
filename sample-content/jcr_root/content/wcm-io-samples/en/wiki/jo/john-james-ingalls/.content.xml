&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John James Ingalls&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (December 29, 1833{{spaced ndash}}August 16, 1900) was an [[United States|American]] politician.

John James Ingalls was born in [[Middleton, Massachusetts|Middleton]], [[Massachusetts]], on December 29, 1833. He graduated from [[Williams College]] in 1855. Foreshadowing his later reputation as a wit, his graduation thesis, entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mummy Life&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was a satire of college life. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1857. Moving to [[Kansas Territory]], Ingalls settled in [[Atchison, Kansas|Atchison]] in 1860. He joined the anti-slavery forces and worked to make [[Kansas]] a free state. He was a member of the [[Wyandotte Constitution|Wyandotte constitutional convention]] in 1859 and is reputed to have coined the state motto, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ad astra (phrase)|Ad Astra per Aspera]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

When Kansas was admitted to the Union in 1861, he became secretary of the first state Senate and state senator in 1862. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] he served as judge advocate in the Kansas militia. As an editor of the Atchison newspaper, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Freedom&amp;apos;s Champion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, for three years, he won a national reputation for a series of magazine articles. Elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1873, succeeding [[Samuel C. Pomeroy]], Ingalls served for 18 years. He supported labor and agriculture against monopolies. He also favored the [[Interstate Commerce Act]] and the [[Pendleton Civil Service Act]].

In 1887 Ingalls was elected President pro tempore of the Senate. Praised throughout his life for his keen sarcasm and quick wit, John James Ingalls died in [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]] on August 16, 1900.

In 1905, the state of Kansas donated a marble statue of Ingalls to the [[U.S. Capitol]]&amp;apos;s [[National Statuary Hall Collection]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/ingalls.cfm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
Currently Kansas has plans to replace Ingalls with [[Amelia Earhart]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://cjonline.com/life/connected/2011-03-12/amelias-monument-about-take-flight Amelia&amp;apos;s monument about to take flight]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
