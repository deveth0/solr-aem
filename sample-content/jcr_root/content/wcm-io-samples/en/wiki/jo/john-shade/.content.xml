        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Shade&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[fictional character]] in [[Vladimir Nabokov]]&amp;apos;s 1962 novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pale Fire]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Shade and family==
The structure is notoriously difficult to unravel, but most readers agree that Shade is a [[poet]] married to his teenage sweetheart, Sybil. Their only child, a daughter named Hazel, apparently committed [[suicide]] some time before the novel&amp;apos;s action begins.  Shade lives in the college town of New Wye, amidst the [[Appalachian Mountains]].  His fame is sufficient for [[television]] pundits to often mention him in the same breath (just &amp;quot;one oozy footprint behind&amp;quot;) as his fellow poet [[Robert Frost]], an association which Shade does not entirely enjoy, perhaps because Frost is always mentioned first.

==Shade&amp;apos;s poetry==
Nabokov provides some incidental samples of Shade&amp;apos;s work—&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Sacred Tree&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Swing&amp;apos;&amp;apos;— in addition to the title poem.  This is a gallant authorial gesture, as when a professor at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], Nabokov had complained from the lectern of authors who ask readers to accept a character&amp;apos;s gifts on faith:  &amp;quot;The author has hinted already that Gurov [the focus of Chekhov&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lady with the Little Dog&amp;apos;&amp;apos;] was witty in the company of women: and instead of having the reader take it for granted (you know the old method of describing the talk as &amp;apos;brilliant&amp;apos; but giving no samples of the conversation), Chekhov makes him joke in a really attractive, winning way.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Vladimir Nabokov, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lectures on Russian Literature&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Fredson Bowers, Editor), New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1981. p. 257.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The longest sample is Shade&amp;apos;s 999-line work, rendered in [[heroic couplet]]s (rhyming pairs of lines in [[iambic pentameter]]), which is also titled &amp;quot;Pale Fire&amp;quot; and provides one facet of the novel&amp;apos;s reflexive structure.

Divided into four cantos, Shade&amp;apos;s poem describes his life, his obsession with the senses, and his boyhood-to-maturity preoccupation with death.  The work is notable for its description of a [[near-death experience]] (Shade treats it with a mixture of skepticism and reverence), and for the &amp;quot;faint hope&amp;quot; of an [[afterlife]] which it provides.

Shade&amp;apos;s poetry is referenced in the last chapter of Nabokov&amp;apos;s 1969 novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Shade&amp;apos;s commentator==
John&amp;apos;s next-door neighbor is [[Charles Kinbote]], who may or may not be suffering delusions of grandeur.  Kinbote is the presenter and annotator of Shade&amp;apos;s poem. Some critics assert that Kinbote is Shade&amp;apos;s invention, while others maintain that Shade is a literary device or a fiction that Kinbote employs to further his own ends. Other interpretations are possible; Zembla &amp;amp;mdash; the country Kinbote claims to come from &amp;amp;mdash; is after all a land of &amp;quot;resemblances.&amp;quot;
