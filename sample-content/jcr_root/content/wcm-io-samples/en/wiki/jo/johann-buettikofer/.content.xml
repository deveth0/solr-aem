        text="&lt;p&gt;Dr. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Johann Büttikofer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (9 August 1850 – 24 June 1927) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[zoologist]].

Büttikofer was born in Ranflüh (part of [[Rüderswil]], [[Canton of Bern]]) in [[Emmenthal]]. After his retirement he settled in Bern. He died following recurring bouts of pneumonia after
a trip to the Dutch East Indies.

==Scientific career==

Büttikofer studied [[biology]] at [[Bern]] and trained in the preparation of animal specimens at the [[Bern Museum of Natural History]]. In 1878 he joined the staff of the Royal Zoological Museum in [[Leiden]] and was mentored by the director, Dr. [[Herman Schlegel]], becoming curator between 1884 and 1897. He made two trips to [[Liberia]], the first was from 1879 to 1882, and the second from 1886 to 1887; he returned from both expeditions in compromised health. Büttikofer collected the first complete specimens of the [[pygmy hippopotamus, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Choeropsis liberiensis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] known to science. The specimens were taken to the [[Natural History Museum, Leiden|Natural History Museum]] of [[Leiden]]. He was accompanied by a Dutch man, Mr. C. F. Sala of Leiden, on the first expedition, who died on 10 June, 1881 in Robertsport, Liberia. On his second expedition he recruited a Swiss boyhood acquaintance, Mr. F. X. Stampfli of Solothurn, and expanded the collected specimens significantly, including the acquisition of the type specimen of [[Jentink&amp;apos;s Duiker, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cephalophus jentinki&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] at Saddle Hill, Liberia. In 1893-94 he accompanied the [[Anton Willem Nieuwenhuis|Nieuwenhuis]] expedition to central [[Borneo]].

In 1890 he published a two-volume work, &amp;quot;Reisebilder aus Liberia&amp;quot; in German. This constituted the first monograph on the Republic of Liberia, and contains some of the earliest photographs of nature in Liberia. An annotated English translation of this publication was produced in November, 2012 by Brill (Leiden), titled &amp;quot;[[Travel Sketches from Liberia: Johann Büttikofer&amp;apos;s 19th Century Rainforest Explorations in West Africa]]&amp;quot;.

Between 1897 and 1924, Büttikofer was the Director of the [[Diergaarde Blijdorp|Zoological Garden]] in [[Rotterdam]]. In 1895 he received a dr. h.c. from the [[University of Bern]]. His animal specimens are in a number of European museum collections, but principally at the natural history museum in Leiden (Naturalis). Ethographic artifacts from his work in Liberia are at the Folk Museum in Leiden ([[Museum Volkenkude]]), the World Museum (([[Werldmuseum]])) in Rotterdam, and at the [[Bern History Museum]]in Switzerland.

==Nature conservation==

Büttikofer was chairman of the Dutch Society for the Protection of Birds (1909-1924). A small ornithological reserve known as &amp;quot;Büttkofer&amp;apos;s Mieland&amp;quot; is named after him on the island of [[Texel]] in the Netherlands. For his extensive contributions of knowledge of Liberian fauna, he is now regarded as the &amp;quot;Father&amp;quot; of Liberian natural history. Many of his scientific papers were published in the &amp;quot;Notes from the Leyden Museum.&amp;quot;
