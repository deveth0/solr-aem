&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kenneth Jon Barwise&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (June 29, 1942&amp;amp;nbsp;– March 5, 2000) was an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]], [[philosopher]] and [[logician]] who proposed some fundamental revisions to the way that [[logic]] is understood and used.

Born in [[Independence, Missouri]] to Kenneth T. and Evelyn, he was a precocious child.

A pupil of [[Solomon Feferman]] at [[Stanford University]], Barwise started his research in [[infinitary logic]]. After positions as assistant professor at the Universities of [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin]], during which time his interests turned to [[natural language]], he returned to Stanford in 1983 to direct the [[Center for the Study of Language and Information]].  He began teaching at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] in 1990. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1999.&amp;lt;ref name=AAAS&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=May 20, 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Barwise contended that, by being explicit about the context in which a [[proposition]] is made, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;situation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, many problems in the application of logic can be eliminated. He sought &amp;apos;&amp;apos;... to understand meaning and inference within a general theory of information, one that takes us outside the realm of sentences and relations between sentences of any language, natural or formal.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; In particular, he claimed that such an approach resolved the [[liar paradox]]. He made use of [[Peter Aczel]]&amp;apos;s [[non-well-founded set theory]] in understanding &amp;quot;[[Liar paradox|vicious circle]]s&amp;quot; of reasoning.

Barwise, along with his former colleague at Stanford [[John Etchemendy]], was the author of the popular logic textbook &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Language, Proof and Logic]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Unlike the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Handbook&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which was a survey of the state of the art of [[Mathematical Logic]] c. 1975, this work targeted elementary logic.  The text is notable for including computer-aided homework problems, some of which provide visual representations of logical problems.  During his time at Stanford, he was also the first Director of the [[Symbolic Systems Program]], an interdepartmental degree program focusing on the relationships between cognition, language, logic, and computation. The K. Jon Barwise Award for Distinguished Contributions to the Symbolic Systems Program has been given periodically since 2001.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[https://symsys.stanford.edu/ssp_static?page=Honors-Awards.html Symbolic Systems Program&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
