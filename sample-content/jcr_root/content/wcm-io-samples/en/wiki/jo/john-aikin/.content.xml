&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Aikin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (15 January 1747 – 7 December 1822) was an [[England|English]] doctor and writer.

==Life==
He was born at [[Kibworth Harcourt]], [[Leicestershire, England]], son of Dr. [[John Aikin (Unitarian)|John Aikin]], Unitarian divine, and received his elementary education at the [[Nonconformist]] [[Warrington Academy|academy at Warrington]], where his father was a tutor. He studied medicine at the [[university of Edinburgh]], and in [[London]] under Dr. [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]]. He practised as a surgeon at [[Chester]] and [[Warrington]]. Finally, he went to [[Leiden]], earned an M.D. (1780), and in 1784 established himself as a doctor in [[Great Yarmouth]].

In 1792, one of his pamphlets having given offence, he moved to London, where he practised as a consulting physician. However, he concerned himself more with the advocacy of liberty of conscience than with his professional duties, and he began at an early period to devote himself to literary pursuits, to which his contributions were incessant. When [[Sir Richard Phillips|Richard Phillips]] founded &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Monthly Magazine (1796)|The Monthly Magazine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1796, Aikin was its first editor. In conjunction with his sister, [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]], he published a popular series of volumes entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Evenings at Home]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (6 vols., 1792–1795),  for elementary family reading, which were translated into almost every [[Europe]]an language.

==Works==
In 1798 Dr. Aikin retired from professional life and devoted himself with great industry to various literary undertakings, among which his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;General Biography&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (10 vols., 1799–1815) holds a conspicuous place. Besides these, he published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Biog. Memoirs of Medicine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1780), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lives of [[John Selden]] and [[Archbishop Usher]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1812) and other works. Aside from editing &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Monthly Magazine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from 1796 to 1807 and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Doodley&amp;apos;s Annual Register&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from 1811-1815,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite NIE|title=Aikin, John|url=http://archive.org/stream/newinternational01gilm#page/231/mode/1up|year=1905}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; he conducted a paper called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Athenaeum (1807–1809)|The Athenaeum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from 1807 to 1809, when it was discontinued.

==Family==
His son, [[Arthur Aikin]], was a prominent scientist and his daughter, [[Lucy Aikin]], was a biographer.
