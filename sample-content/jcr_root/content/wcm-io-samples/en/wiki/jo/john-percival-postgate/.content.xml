&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Percival Postgate&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (24 October 1853 â€“ 15 July 1926) was an [[England|English]] [[classics|classicist]], professor of [[Latin]] at the [[University of Liverpool]] from 1909 to 1920.

Born in [[Birmingham]], the son of John Postgate, he was educated at [[King Edward&amp;apos;s School, Birmingham|King Edward&amp;apos;s School]] where he became head boy. He won a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] where he read classics, being elected a Fellow in 1878.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Venn|id=PSTT872JP|name=Postgate, John Percival}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He established himself as a creative editor of [[Latin]] [[poetry]] with published editions of [[Propertius]], [[Lucan (poet)|Lucan]], [[Tibullus]] and [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]]. His major work was the two-volume &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Corpus Poetarum Latinorum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a triumph of editorial organisation. While at Cambridge, he edited the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Classical Review]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Classical Quarterly]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; while holding the chair of comparative philology at [[University College, London]]. In 1909, reconciled that the Cambridge Chair would go to [[A.E. Housman]], as it did in 1911, Postgate opted to become Professor of Latin at Liverpool.

He retired to Cambridge in 1920. On 14 July 1926 he was injured in a cycling accident and died of his injuries the following day.

==Family==
He was the father of [[Raymond Postgate]] (a journalist, historian and novelist), and [[Margaret Cole]] (a politician), and was grandfather to the animator and puppeteer [[Oliver Postgate]].
