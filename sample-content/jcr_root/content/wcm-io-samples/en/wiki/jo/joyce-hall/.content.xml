&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Joyce Clyde Hall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (August 29, 1891 &amp;amp;ndash; October 29, 1982), an American businessman, was the founder of [[Hallmark Cards]].

== Biography ==
Born in 1891 in [[David City, Nebraska]], the son of Nancy Dudley Houston and George Nelson Hall, a traveling minister &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071021044949/http://wargs.com/other/hall.html Ancestry of Joyce Clyde Hall&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; who provided sparingly for his wife and children. When Hall was seven, his father abandoned the family. Hall worked odd jobs, mostly involving sales, from age 8 on. Hall&amp;apos;s response to his father&amp;apos;s mantra, &amp;quot;the Lord will provide,&amp;quot; was, &amp;quot;It&amp;apos;s a good idea to give the Lord a little help.&amp;quot; In 1905, Hall and his brothers invested US$540 to buy picture postcards to sell to store owners and other dealers around their area. They also convinced some of the traveling salesmen who came into the Halls&amp;apos; bookstore, which Joyce Hall&amp;apos;s older brothers bought with a partner in 1902, to add the postcards to their sales territories.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[Hall, Joyce C. with Curtiss Anderson. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;When You Care Enough&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Kansas City: Hallmark Cards, Inc., 1992. p. 23]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Hall conceived the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Norfolk Post Card Company&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1908 in [[Norfolk, Nebraska]].

In 1910, Hall moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], with little more than two shoe boxes of postcards. By 1913, he and his brothers were operating a store (which would eventually evolve into Kansas City&amp;apos;s [[Halls (department store)|Halls]] department store) selling not only postcards but also greeting cards. The store burned in 1915, and a year later, Hall bought an engraving business and began printing his own cards. It turned into a bigger business than he had had before. In 1928, he began marketing his cards under the Hallmark brand name. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://corporate.hallmark.com/history/Early-Innovation-1910s-30s Hallmark History]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Hall, who objected to the name Joyce and typically went by &amp;quot;J.C.,&amp;quot; retired in 1966 and spent his retirement in efforts to revitalize the [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] downtown area. One of the results was [[Crown Center]], a combination business/shopping district surrounding the Hallmark corporate headquarters. Hall died in 1982 in Kansas City.
