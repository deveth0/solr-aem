&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Macon Thome&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (August 22, 1843 &amp;amp;ndash; September 27, 1908) was an American-[[Argentina|Argentine]] [[astronomer]].  Some sources say &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Macom Thome&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He is sometimes known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Juan M. Thome&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

He was born in [[Palmyra, Pennsylvania]] and attended [[Lehigh University]].

He came to the Argentine National Observatory (today [[Observatorio Astron贸mico de C贸rdoba]]) in 1870, working as the senior assistant of the director [[Benjamin A. Gould]].  He succeeded Gould as director in 1885.

Under his initiative, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Cordoba Durchmusterung]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[star catalogue]] began to be compiled in 1892, although he did not live to see its completion.

He won the [[Lalande Prize]] for astronomy from the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1901.  Thome died in [[C贸rdoba, Argentina|C贸rdoba]] and was succeeded as director of the observatory by [[Charles Dillon Perrine]].
