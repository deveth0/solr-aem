&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Joseph &amp;quot;Pleasant Gardens&amp;quot; McDowell&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 25, 1758 â€“ March 7, 1799) was an American lawyer, soldier, and statesman from [[Morganton, North Carolina]].

His estate was named &amp;quot;Pleasant Gardens&amp;quot;, and he was nicknamed &amp;quot;Pleasant Gardens Joe&amp;quot; to distinguish him from his cousin, [[Joseph McDowell, Jr.|Joseph &amp;quot;Quaker Meadows&amp;quot; McDowell]]. The two men are not always clearly distinguished in historical records: both were at the 1780 [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], one as a major leading the [[Burke County, North Carolina|Burke County]] militia, and the other in a subordinate role as a captain. Although &amp;quot;Quaker Meadows&amp;quot; Joe is usually hailed as the Major McDowell who was the hero of the battle, some descendants of &amp;quot;Pleasant Gardens Joe&amp;quot; maintain that it was their ancestor who led the Burke County militia, a claim which, according to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dictionary of American Biography&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is contradicted by contemporary evidence.

According to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;Pleasant Gardens&amp;quot; McDowell was later appointed a North Carolina [[militia]] general, and served in the [[3rd United States Congress]] from 1793 to 1795. However, these accomplishments are sometimes credited to Joseph &amp;quot;Quaker Meadows&amp;quot; McDowell, although the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dictionary of American Biography&amp;apos;&amp;apos; notes that the Congressional directory may be correct.

McDowell died on March 7, 1799 on his estate in what was [[Burke County, North Carolina]] but is now part of [[McDowell County, North Carolina]].
