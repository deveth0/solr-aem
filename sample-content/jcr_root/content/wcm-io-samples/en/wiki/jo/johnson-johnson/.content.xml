&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Johnson Johnson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the hero of a series of mystery novels written by [[Dorothy Dunnett]] (originally published under the pseudonym, Dorothy Halliday). Johnson Johnson is a widowed [[portrait painter]] who doubles as an agent for the British secret service. A constant theme in all the novels is his [[yacht]], the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dolly&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Each book is told in the first person, from the viewpoint of the heroine, and opens with a comment on Johnson Johnson&amp;apos;s bifocals.
