&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;JOSS&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (an acronym for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[JOHNNIAC]] Open Shop System&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was one of the very first interactive, [[time sharing]] programming languages.

JOSS I, developed by [[Cliff Shaw|J. Clifford Shaw]] at [[RAND]] was first implemented, in beta form, on the [[JOHNNIAC]] computer in May 1963.  The full implementation was deployed in January 1964, supporting 5 terminals and the final version, supporting 10 terminals, was deployed in January 1965.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;hopl&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book| editor1-first = Richard L |editor1-last=Wexelblat| |year=1981|title=History of Programming Languages|location=New York|publisher = Academic Press|isbn=0-12-745040-8}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal

JOSS was written in a symbolic assembly language called EasyFox (E and F in the US military&amp;apos;s phonetic alphabet of that time).  EasyFox was also developed by Cliff Shaw.

JOSS was dubbed &amp;quot;The Helpful Assistant&amp;quot; and is renowned for its conversational user interface.  Originally green/black typewriter ribbons were used in its terminals with green being used for user input and black for the computer&amp;apos;s response.  Any command that was not understood elicited the response &amp;quot;Eh?&amp;quot;.

JOSS II, was developed by Charles L. Baker, Joseph W. Smith, Irwin D. Greenwald, and G. Edward Bryan for the [[PDP-6]] computer between 1964 and February 1966.

Many variants of JOSS were developed and implemented on a variety of platforms. &amp;lt;!-- not worth mentioning if we can&amp;apos;t identify it more specifically:
including one for the [[IBM]] [[System/360]] which was still in use up to the mid [[1970]]s --&amp;gt;
Some of these variants remained very similar to the original: [[TELCOMP]], [[FOCAL]], [[CAL programming language|CAL]], [[CITRAN]], ISIS, PIL/I, [[JEAN]] ([[ICT 1900 series]]), [[Algebraic Interpretive Dialogue|AID]] ([[PDP-10]]); while others, such as [[MUMPS]], developed in distinctive directions.

==Sample program==
 1.1 Demand p,q.
 1.2 Stop if q&amp;lt;0 or r(q,2)=0.
 1.3 Set a=1.
 1.4 Do part 2 while q&amp;gt;1 and a~=0.
 1.5 Type a in form 3.
 1.6 Stop.

 2.1  Do part 20.
 2.1  Do part 11 if p&amp;lt;0.
 2.2  Do part 12 if p&amp;gt;=q.
 2.3  Do part 13 if p=0.
 2.4  Done if a=0.
 2.5  Set p=p/4 while r(p,4)=0.
 2.6  Do part 14 if r(p,2)=0.
 2.7  Do part 20.
 2.8  Set a=-a if r(p,4)=r(q,4)=3.
 2.9  Set s=p, p=q, q=s.
 2.95 Do part 20.

 11.1 Set a=-a if r(q,4)=3.
 11.2 Set p=|p|.
 11.3 Do part 20.

 12.1 Set p=r(p,q).
 12.2 Do part 20.

 13.1 Set a=0, p=1, q=1.

 14.1 Set a=-a if r(q,8)=3 or r(q,8)=5.
 14.2 Set p=p/2.

 20.1 Type p, q in form 1 if a=1.
 20.2 Type p, q in form 2 if a=-1.

 Form 1: &amp;quot;  L(%.0f,%.0f)  =&amp;quot;
 Form 2: &amp;quot;  -L(%.0f,%.0f)  =&amp;quot;
 Form 3: &amp;quot;  %.0f\n&amp;quot;

Note that this is not an original sample, but rather one from a modern simulator. There are some syntactic differences from the original JOSS language.
