&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Randolph Hearst&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1909&amp;amp;ndash;1958) was an American business executive and the third son of [[William Randolph Hearst]].

He married Gretchen Wilson, who later married Woolworth Donahue (Jesse (Woolworth) Donahue&amp;apos;s son).

He was said by some to have the most executive talent among the sons of William Randolph Hearst, and like his brothers worked for the [[Hearst Corporation]].

Any question of his rivaling the non-family executives who constituted a majority of the trustees of his father&amp;apos;s will, however, was rendered moot by his untimely death. He left four children, including [[John Randolph Hearst, Jr.]], a company executive and director who represented this branch of the family among the trustees,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5glp18Myoxt491zK6w10zXyreqT7g?docId=1acbbc4823204aaeabe0a10facffbc6c |title=The Associated Press: John Randolph Hearst Jr. dies in NYC at 77 |publisher=Google.com |date=1933-12-08 |accessdate=2011-11-06}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
