&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jon Crosby&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born July 25, 1976) is an [[United States|American]] [[musician]] and founder of the musical outfit, [[VAST]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p293306|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: VAST|last=Prato|first=Greg|publisher=[[All Media Guide|AMG]]|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Biography==

Crosby was born in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], and grew up in [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt]] and [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma]] counties in Northern California, raised by a single mother from an upper-class family who owned a record store in [[Fortuna, California]]. His great-grandfather was [[John C. Crosby]], a congressman from [[Massachusetts]] and his ancestry on his mother&amp;apos;s side is English and Native American. It is speculated that his father, who was a lounge guitarist whom he never met, may have been partially Japanese.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

At the age of 13, he was profiled in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Guitar Player]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; magazine and Shrapnel Magazine as a rising young star.  He developed a love for [[european classical music|classical music]] after watching the film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. When he met a girl named Michelle in 6th Grade, he learned to play [[The Beatles]]&amp;apos; hit &amp;quot;[[Michelle (song)|Michelle]]&amp;quot; on guitar to impress her. This sparked his interest in The Beatles, and in [[Rock and roll|rock music]] in general. Crosby&amp;apos;s other influences include [[Steve Vai]], [[Joe Satriani]], [[U2]], and [[Depeche Mode]]. He formed VAST in 1993, at the age of 16, after moving to Petaluma, CA with friends Mike Alioti and Dimitri Katzoff, formerly of ska-band [[The Conspiracy]], though that line-up was short-lived and would be frequently supplanted. He played few early shows, mainly at the famed [[Phoenix Theater]], where many early actsâ€”like [[Green Day]] -- got their first big break.

At 19, Crosby&amp;apos;s manager/ex-girlfriend Sakina Sati took him to New York, along with ex-members Daniel Alva and Stephen Garver, for the purpose of shopping his demo tapes through [[Shiva Baum]], former manager for [[Opiate for the Masses]], and a bidding war broke out; he then signed with [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. Two albums were released by Elektra - &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Visual Audio Sensory Theater]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1998 and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Music For People]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 2000. In 2002, however, Crosby left the label. 2003 saw him break new ground when he released two digital download albums, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Turquoise 3.x]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Crimson 3.x]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He then moved on to [[Carson Daly]]&amp;apos;s [[456 Entertainment]], where &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Nude (VAST album)|Nude]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was released in 2004.

In 2003 he started his own record label, [[2Blossoms Records &amp;amp; Media]]. Late 2007 and early 2008, Crosby released five download-only EPs, under the collective title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Generica]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was to be &amp;quot;an exploration of people, places and American music.&amp;quot; The first three volumes were solo acoustic guitar songs, while the last two were recorded along with VAST band members under the name &amp;quot;Jon Crosby And The Resonator Band&amp;quot;. Crosby stressed the difference between this outfit and VAST:

{{cquote|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;When we put out &amp;quot;April&amp;quot; we were toying with the idea of releasing it as a JCRB album because the style was such a departure from previous VAST music. But then I thought, just because the music is different that doesn&amp;apos;t mean it has to be a side project. Plus, a side project with the same members seemed a little bizarre. As we were recording the songs that would eventually go on Generica five we planned on putting them on a VAST album. Commercially it would have made more sense because people have heard of VAST but most people have not heard of JCRB. But to me, this music isn&amp;apos;t VAST.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}
