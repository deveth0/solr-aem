&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Motley Morehead&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (July 4, 1796 â€“ August 27, 1866) was the [[List of Governors of North Carolina|29th]] [[Governor of North Carolina|Governor]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[North Carolina]] from 1841 to 1845. He is known as &amp;quot;the Father of Modern North Carolina.&amp;quot;

Born in [[Pittsylvania County, Virginia]], Morehead was the son of Obedience (Motley) and John Morehead. He moved to [[Rockingham County, North Carolina]] at the age of two.

Morehead graduated from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in 1817. He was also a distinguished member of [[The Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies]] at UNC. He served in the [[North Carolina General Assembly]] for several sessions and was the first governor inaugurated in the new State Capitol.

During his term in office, Morehead supported the new public school system, the extension of railroad lines, the improvement of rivers and harbors, and the construction of waterways and turnpikes. Morehead was instrumental in raising private funds for a railroad line to accompany $2 million provided by the legislature. The terminus of the railroad, [[Morehead City, North Carolina]], was named after him. For his efforts, Morehead was also elected president of the North Carolina Railroad.

After his term, he returned to his home, [[Blandwood Mansion and Gardens|Blandwood]], in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], designed by [[New York]] architect [[Alexander Jackson Davis]]. There, Morehead entertained numerous politicians and personalities of the day, including [[Dorothea Dix]]. In 1861, he represented the state at a conference to avoid war. With the failure of the conference and the secession of North Carolina, Morehead served in the Confederate Congress. Morehead died at Rockbridge Springs, Virginia in 1866 and is buried in the Old First Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Greensboro.

His grandson, also named John Motley Morehead, bequeathed to the University of North Carolina $130 million dollars, commissioned the university&amp;apos;s planetarium, and funded the John Motley Morehead Foundation. Descendants include Jean Motley Morehead Larkin, John L. Morehead, W. Harris Nelson, William H.M. Nelson III [[The Pilot (Pilot Mountain, North Carolina)]].
