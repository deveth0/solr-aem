&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;José Watanabe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1946-April 25, 2007) was a [[Peru]]vian poet who won a number of literary awards.

Watanabe was born in [[Laredo, Peru|Laredo]], a large [[sugar cane]] farm in northern Peru.  His father was a Japanese immigrant and his mother was a Peruvian of [[Andean]] origin. In a very intimate way, Watanabe fused his two deep cultural backgrounds in brief but intense poetic work.

In 1970, Watanabe shared, with [[Antonio Cillóniz]], first prize in the &amp;quot;Young Poet&amp;quot; contest organized by &amp;quot;Cuadernos trimestrales de Poesía.&amp;quot; This award has also been bestowed upon poets such as [[Javier Heraud]] and [[Cesar Calvo]]. He won the award &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Young Poet of Peru&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1971 with his first book, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Album de Familia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

After a silence of almost two decades, he resumed publishing in 1989 with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;El huso de la palabra&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. After that came &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Historia Natural&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1994), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cosas del Cuerpo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1999) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Habitó entre Nosotros&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2002). In 2000, he published in [[Colombia]] an anthology entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;El Guardián del Hielo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and in 2004 he published in Spain &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elogio del Refrenamiento&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a comprehensive anthology that won numerous accolades.

&amp;quot;He is one of the few living Peruvian authors that can be qualified as essential&amp;quot; wrote [[Esperanza Lopez Parada]] in [[Babelia]], the literary supplement of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[El País]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Watanabe was also involved in the film industry as a screenwriter, production designer and art director.  He died in April 2007.
