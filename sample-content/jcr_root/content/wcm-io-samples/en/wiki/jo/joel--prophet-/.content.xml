&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Joel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|oʊ|.|ə|l}}; {{lang-he|יואל}}) (Yoel) was a prophet of [[ancient Israel]], the second of the twelve [[minor prophets]] and the author of the [[Book of Joel]]. He is mentioned by name only once in the [[Hebrew Bible]]/[[Old Testament]], in the introduction to his own brief book, as the son of Pethuel ({{Bibleverse||Joel|1:1|121}}). The name Joel combines the covenant name of God, [[YHWH]] (or Yahweh), and [[el (god)]], and has been translated as &amp;quot;one to whom [[YHWH]] is God,&amp;quot; that is, a worshipper of YHWH.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://jfb.biblecommenter.com/joel/1.htm Commentary by A. R. Faussett]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The dates of his life are unknown; he may have lived anywhere from the 9th century [[BC]] to the 5th century BCE, depending on the dating of his book. The book&amp;apos;s mention of [[Greeks]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Joel 3:6&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; has not given scholars any help in dating the text since the Greeks were known to have had access to [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] from [[Helladic period|Mycenaean]] times.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;A-Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, B. M. Wheeler, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Joel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; However, the book&amp;apos;s mention of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]]&amp;apos;s suffering&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Joel 3:19&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and to the standing temple&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Joel 1:14&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; has led some scholars to place the date of the book in the post-exilic period, after the construction of the [[Second Temple]]. Joel was originally from [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]/[[Judea]], and, judging from its prominence in his prophecy, was quite possibly a prophet associated with the ritual of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem temple]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Leslie C. Allen, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Books of Joel, Obadiah, Jonah and Micah&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1976), p.31&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

According to a long-standing tradition, Joel was buried in [[Gush Halav]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;amp;_Culture/geo/Gush_HaLav.html Gush Halav]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==In Christianity==
On the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical calendar]], his feast day is October 19.  He is commemorated with the other [[Minor prophet]]s in the [[Calendar of Saints (Armenian Apostolic Church)|Calendar of saints]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] on July 31.

Joel&amp;apos;s statement that &amp;quot;I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions&amp;quot; was applied by St Peter in his sermon at Pentecost to the events of that day. Since then other religious figures have interpreted the words as having special significance for their own time.

==In the Baha&amp;apos;i Faith==
Joel is considered a [[Manifestation of God#Minor prophets|minor prophet]] in the Baha&amp;apos;i Faith.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Revisioning the Sacred: New Perspectives on a Bahái̓́ Theology - Volume 8 - Page 32, J. A. McLean - 1997&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In the [[Kitab-i-Iqan]], Baha&amp;apos;ullah states that previous prophecies by minor prophets such as Joel are merely symbolical and should not be understood literally.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Bahá&amp;apos;u&amp;apos;lláh and the New Era: An Introduction to the Bahá&amp;apos;í Faith - Page 251, J. E. Esslemont - 2006&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
Yet the tradition of the veneration of Joel or Joelle the pilgrim is still observed by the minority of Baha&amp;apos;i followers in LEBANON on the 23rd of May every year, under the title of the &amp;quot;festivities of Joel the pilgrim (al hajj)&amp;quot;.
