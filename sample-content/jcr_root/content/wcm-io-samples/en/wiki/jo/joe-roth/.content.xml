==Early life==

Vitale&amp;apos;&amp;apos; By Susan Dudley Gold]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 1959, Roth&amp;apos;s father volunteered his son to be a plaintiff in the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]]&amp;apos;s effort to abolish mandatory prayer in public schools. The case, filed in New York, wound its way through the system, finally reaching the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1962. The Court ruled that such prayer was unconstitutional under the First Amendment, in the landmark case of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Engel v. Vitale]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Hammer, Joshua. &amp;quot;The Sly Dog at Fox&amp;quot;. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Newsweek]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 25 May 1992.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Over the course of his career, he has produced over 40 films, and has directed six to date, including 1990&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Coupe de Ville (film)|Coupe de Ville]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (in which a [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville]] plays a big part) and 2001&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[America&amp;apos;s Sweethearts]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Roth, who was ranked 6th in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Premiere Magazine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s 2003 Hollywood Power List, produced the 76th annual [[Academy Awards]]. Roth announced that in October 2007, when Revolution&amp;apos;s distribution deal with [[Sony Pictures]] ends, Revolution Studios will close and he will join Sony as a producer.

On November 13, 2007, Roth was introduced as the majority owner of a [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]]-based [[Major League Soccer]] franchise along with [[Paul Allen]]. [[Seattle Sounders FC]]—which calls [[CenturyLink Field]] home—began regular season play in 2009.

==Personal life==
He is married to Donna Arkoff whose father was movie producer [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/19/arts/samuel-z-arkoff-maker-of-drive-in-thrillers-dies-at-83.html?pagewanted=all New York Times: &amp;quot;Samuel Z.
