        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Cleves Symmes, Jr.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1779 – May 1829) was an American army officer whose 1818 [[Hollow Earth theory]], expounded on the lecture circuit, gained him considerable notoriety.

==Biography==
Symmes was born in [[New Jersey]] to Timothy Symmes. In some local dealings he used the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Junior&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to distinguish himself from his prominent uncle [[John Cleves Symmes]]. His cousin, [[Anna Harrison]] briefly served as First Lady of the United States. He died in May 1829 and is buried in Symmes Park &amp;lt;!-- Where is Symmes Park??? --&amp;gt;at [[Hamilton, Ohio]].  His son, Americus Symmes, erected a [[Hollow Earth]] monument above his grave. [[Image:Hollow Earth Monument.jpg|thumb|right|150px|]]

He joined the [[United States Army]] in 1802 and rose to the rank of Captain during the [[War of 1812]]. He was stationed along the [[Canada|Canadian]] frontier, at both [[Fort Niagara]] and Fort Erie.

His 1818 theory of a Hollow Earth, envisioning a shell about 1250&amp;amp;nbsp;km (800&amp;amp;nbsp;mi) thick, with openings at both poles about 2200&amp;amp;nbsp;km (1400&amp;amp;nbsp;mi) across with four inner shells also open at the poles, made his name famous/notorious.

Some have claimed he was the real author of: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Symzonia; Voyage of Discovery&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ISBN 0-405-06312-1, which was attributed to &amp;quot;Captain Adam Seaborn&amp;quot;.  A recent reprint gives him as the author.  Other researchers argue against this idea.  Some think it was written as a satire of Symmes&amp;apos; ideas, and believe they identified the author as an early American writer named [[Nathaniel Ames]] who wrote other works, including one that might have served as the inspiration of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Moby Dick&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  (see Lang, Hans-Joachim and Benjamin Lease. &amp;quot;The Authorship of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Symzonia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: The Case for Nathanial Ames&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;New England Quarterly&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, June 1975, pg 241-252.)

Symmes himself never wrote a book of his ideas, as he was too busy expounding them on the lecture circuit, but others did.  His follower [[James McBride (pioneer)|James McBride]] wrote &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Symmes&amp;apos; Theory of Concentric Spheres&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1826.  Another follower, [[Jeremiah N. Reynolds]] apparently had an article that was published as a separate booklet in 1827: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Remarks of Symmes&amp;apos; Theory Which Appeared in the American Quarterly Review&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  In 1868 a professor W.F. Lyons published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Hollow Globe&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which put forth a Symmes-like Hollow Earth theory, but did not mention Symmes.  Symmes&amp;apos;s son Americus then published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Symmes&amp;apos; Theory of Concentric Spheres&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to set the record straight.

==Legacy==
Compare a fictional echo of Symmes in [[Ian Wedde]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Symmes Hole&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1987); and a focus on both Symmes and Reynolds in [[James Chapman (author)|James Chapman&amp;apos;s]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Our Plague: A  Film From New York&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1993).

John Cleves Symmes also makes an appearance in [[Rudy Rucker]]&amp;apos;s steampunk novel, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Hollow Earth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and in [[Felix J. Palma]]´s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Map of the Sky&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
