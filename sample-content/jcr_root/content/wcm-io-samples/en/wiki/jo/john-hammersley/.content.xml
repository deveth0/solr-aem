&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Michael Hammersley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (21 March 1920 – 2 May 2004)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.2007.0001}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=math.PR/0610862 |title=John Michael Hammersley (1920–2004) |author=Geoffrey Grimmett, Dominic Welsh}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~woodd/Hammersley-FamilyTree.pdf |title=The Academic Family Tree of John M. Hammersley |author=David R. Wood}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]] best known for his foundational work in the theory of [[self-avoiding walks]] and [[percolation theory]]. He was born in [[Helensburgh]] in [[Dunbartonshire]], and educated at [[Sedbergh School]]. He started reading [[mathematics]] at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] but was called up to join the [[Royal Artillery]] in 1941. During his time in the army he worked on [[ballistics]].

He graduated in mathematics in 1948. He held a number of positions, both in and outside academia. His book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Monte Carlo Methods&amp;apos;&amp;apos; with David Handscomb was published in 1964.

He was an advocate of [[problem solving]], and an opponent of abstraction in mathematics, taking part in the [[New math]] debate.

He was a Fellow (later Professorial Fellow) of [[Trinity College, Oxford]] from 1961, Reader in Mathematical Statistics at [[Oxford University]] from 1969, and elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1976.
