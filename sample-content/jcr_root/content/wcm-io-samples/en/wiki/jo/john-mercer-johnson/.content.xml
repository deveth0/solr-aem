&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Mercer Johnson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (October 1, 1818 &amp;amp;ndash; November 8, 1868) was a politician in the [[New Brunswick|Province of New Brunswick, Canada]] and a [[Father of Confederation]]. He represented [[Miramichi (electoral district)|Northumberland]] in the [[Canadian House of Commons]] from 1867 to 1868 as a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] member.

He was born in [[Liverpool]], England and brought at an early age to [[Chatham, New Brunswick]] by his father, where he became a [[lawyer]] in 1850. He represented [[Northumberland County, New Brunswick|Northumberland County]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]] from 1850 to 1865 and from 1866 to 1867. Johnson was Solicitor General from 1854 to 1856, postmaster general from 1857 to 1859, speaker for the house from 1859 to 1862 and Attorney General from 1862 to 1865. He was delegated to the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]] in 1864 and that of [[London Conference|London]] in 1866. After [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, Johnson was elected to the new [[Canadian House of Commons]] of the federal Parliament.

Johnson was educated at a [[grammar school]] in [[Northumberland]] before he studied [[law]]. In 1840, he was called to the bar of New Brunswick. At the [[Charlottetown Conference]] and the two later conferences discussing the confederation, Johnson vigorously asserted the fact that the provincial governments should not hold any power above the course of the county or zone.

He died in office at [[Chatham, New Brunswick]] at the age of 50.
