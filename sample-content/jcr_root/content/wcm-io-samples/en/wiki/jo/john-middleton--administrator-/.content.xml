        text="&lt;p&gt;{{other people|John Middleton}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sir John Middleton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[KBE]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]] (1870 â€“ 5 November 1954) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Colonialism|colonial]] administrator.

Middleton joined the [[Colonial Office]] in 1901, serving in south [[Nigeria]] for six years as a junior official before moving on to [[Mauritius]] until 1920 when he was promoted to [[governor]] of the [[Falkland Islands]] from 1920 to 1927, [[Gambia]] from 1927 to 1928 and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] from 1928 to 1932.

He was Governor of Newfoundland during a period of acute political crisis that was exacerbated by the [[Great Depression]]. In 1932, he was asked to investigate allegations that the [[Prime Minister]] of Newfoundland, Sir [[Richard Squires]] had falsified cabinet minutes in an attempt to coverup evidence of corruption involving his government. Middleton&amp;apos;s conclusions that there was no evidence of tampering resulted in a [[riot]] outside his office on April 5, 1932 that helped bring down the Squires government. Middleton retired from public life following his term in Newfoundland and returned to [[England]].
