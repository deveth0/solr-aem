&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John W. Holter&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 1, 1916 â€“ December 22, 2003) was a toolmaker working for the Yale and Town Lock Company [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] [[Connecticut]]. His son [[Charles Holter|Charles Case &amp;quot;Casey&amp;quot; Holter]] was born on November 7, 1955 with a severe form of [[spina bifida]]. Shortly after birth he contracted [[meningitis]], which caused his head to expand rapidly. His parents were told that he had developed &amp;quot;water on the brain&amp;quot; or [[hydrocephalus]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2007/04/john_holter_brain_e.html

As luck would have it Holter&amp;apos;s son was being looked after in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], where the surgeons Nulsen and Spitz had already demonstrated that a ventricle-to-atrium diversion system could work. What they needed was an inexpensive and practical valve that could control the direction of the flow and maintain normal cranial pressure.&amp;lt;ref name=spitz&amp;gt;Boockvar, J. A., Loudon, W., Sutton, L. N.; Development of the Spitz-Holter valve in Philadelphia; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;J Neurosurg&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; 95:145-147, 2001&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

A chance discovery showed Holter, after a failed attempt in which a young boy died{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, that he could use a [[silicone]] [[one-way valve]] (pressure sealing). After a medically suitable grade of [[Silastic]] ([[silicone]] and rubber) was found, the device was patented,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite patent|US|2969066}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and John Holter set up a company, Holter-Hausner International, to manufacture the [[cerebral shunt]]s.

Although he was unable to save his son Casey, his design, the Spitz-Holter valve (also called the Spitz-Holter shunt) continues to help millions around the world since the late 1950s.
