        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Joe Bowen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born April 5, 1951 in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]]), is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[sportscaster]].  He is known as &amp;quot;The Voice of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]&amp;quot;, having broadcast over 2,100 Leaf games.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=338996&amp;amp;page=NewsPage&amp;amp;service=page Joe Bowen&amp;apos;s blog]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He started calling games for the Leafs in 1982, after calling games for the [[Nova Scotia Voyageurs]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.thestar.com/sports/article/263058 25 years, holy mackinaw! From the Toronto Star]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Bowen&amp;apos;s [[catchphrase]] is &amp;quot;Holy Mackinaw!&amp;quot;, typically used when an amazing goal is scored or a big save is made. It has been suggested that the phrase  originated from a California Spirit Yell, but Bowen claims he got the phrase from his dad who said &amp;quot;Holy Mackinaw&amp;quot; instead of swearing. He is also known for his creative alliteration when announcing the starting goaltenders (e.g. technicians of the tangled twine, watchdogs of the webbed wickets, officers of the oblong onion bags, etc.). [[Greg Millen]] is currently his broadcasting partner, after his longtime partner [[Harry Neale]] accepted a position with the [[Buffalo Sabres]].  Bowen and Millen are the voices of Leaf games on [[television]] through [[Leafs TV]] or [[Rogers Sportsnet|Rogers Sportsnet Ontario]]. Bowen also does the [[radio]] play-by-play on [[CFMJ (AM)|AM 640]] with [[Jim Ralph]] for playoff games and games that are broadcast on TSN or CBC.  Recently, he appeared in a TV commercial for [[Harvey&amp;apos;s]] promoting the &amp;quot;bigger&amp;quot; Angus Burger and used his famous aforementioned catchphrase. Joe Bowen was the Radio Announcer in the 1986 film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Youngblood (1986 film)|Youngblood]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Also, he has called several lacrosse seasons for the [[National Lacrosse League|NLL]]&amp;apos;s [[Toronto Rock]] from their inception in Toronto 1999 after one season in [[Hamilton, ON|Hamilton]] as the Ontario Raiders.  This included the 1999-2002 NLL championship games and is believed to have stopped after the 2007 or 2007 seasons.

==Early life==
