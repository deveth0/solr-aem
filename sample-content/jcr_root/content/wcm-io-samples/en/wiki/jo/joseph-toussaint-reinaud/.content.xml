&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Joseph Toussaint Reinaud&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (December 4, 1795 - May 14, 1867) was a [[France|French]] [[oriental studies|orientalist]].

== Life ==
Joseph Toussaint Reinaud was born at [[Lambesc]], [[Bouches-du-Rhône]]. He came to [[Paris]] in 1815, and became a pupil of [[Silvestre de Sacy]]. In 1818-19 he was at [[Rome]] as an attaché to the French minister, and studied under the Maronites of the Propaganda, but gave special attention to Muslim coins.

In 1824 he entered the department of oriental manuscripts in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Royal Library]] at Paris, and in 1838, on the death of De Sacy, he succeeded to his chair in the [[Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales|School of Living Oriental Languages]]. In 1847 he became president of the [[Société Asiatique|Asiatic Society]], and in 1858 conservator of oriental manuscripts in the Imperial Library.

His first important work was his classic description of the collections of the [[Pierre Louis Jean Casimir de Blacas|Duc de Blacas]] (1828). To history he contributed an essay on the Arab invasions of France, [[Savoy]], [[Piedmont]] and [[Switzerland]] (1836), and various collections for the period of the [[crusades]]; he edited (1840) and in part translated (1848) the geography of [[Abulfeda]].

To him too is due a useful edition of the very curious records of early Arab intercourse with [[China]] of which [[Eusèbe Renaudot]] had given but an imperfect translation (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Relation des voyages&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, etc., 1845), and various other essays illustrating the ancient and medieval geography of the East.
