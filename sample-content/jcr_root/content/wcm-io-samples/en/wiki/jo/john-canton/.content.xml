}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Canton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (31 July 1718 &amp;amp;ndash; 22 March 1772) was an [[England|English]] [[physicist]].

Canton was born in Middle Street [[Stroud, Gloucestershire|Stroud]], [[Gloucestershire]], the son of a weaver John Canton (b. 1687) and Esther (nÃ©e Davis). At the age of nineteen, under the auspices of Dr Henry Miles, he was articled for five years as clerk to Samuel Watkins, the master of a school in Spital Square, London, with whom at the end of that time he entered into partnership..

In 1750 he read a paper before the [[Royal Society]] on a method of making artificial [[magnet]]s, which procured him election as a fellow of the society and the award of the [[Copley Medal]]. He was the first in England to verify [[Benjamin Franklin]]&amp;apos;s hypothesis of the identity of [[lightning]] and [[electricity]], and he made several important electrical discoveries.

In 1762 and 1764 he published experiments in refutation of the decision of the [[Florentine Academy]], at that time generally accepted, that [[water]] is incompressible.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal | author = Canton, John | title = Experiments to Prove That Water is Not Incompressible | journal = Philosophical Transactions (1683-1775) | year = 1761-1762 | volume = 52 | pages = 640&amp;amp;ndash;643 | jstor = 105681}}

He died in London aged 53 of [[dropsy]].

He was the recipient of letters from [[Thomas Bayes]], which were then published by the Royal Society.
