Styled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marquess of Granby&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from 1711, he succeeded to the title in 1721, cutting short a brief career in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], where he had represented [[Rutland (UK Parliament constituency)|Rutland]] as a [[British Whig Party|Whig]].

He held a variety of government and court positions including [[Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire]] 1721–1779, [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] 1727–1736, [[Lord Steward of the Household]] 1755–1761, and Master of the Horse 1761–1766.

In 1717 he married Bridget Sutton, the 17-year-old heiress of [[Robert Sutton, 2nd Baron Lexinton]]. They had eleven children, most of whom died young:
*Lady Catherine Rachel Manners (b. 1718), died young
*Lady Caroline Manners (b. spring 1719), died young
*Lady Frances and Lady Bridget Manners (d. 30 December 1719), twins
*[[John Manners, Marquess of Granby]] (1721–1770)
*[[Lord Robert Manners-Sutton]] (1722–1762)
*[[Lord George Manners-Sutton]] (1723–1783)
*Lord William Manners (29 July 1724 – 11 March 1730)
*Lady Leonora Manners (d. June 1740)
*Lady Frances Manners (c. 1726 – 3 February 1739)
*Lord Frederick Manners (b. 17 February 1728)

In 1722 he became a Knight of the [[Order of the Garter]] and in 1727 was sworn of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. He supported the creation of [[London]]&amp;apos;s [[Foundling Hospital]] and was one of its founding governors when it received its [[royal charter]] in 1739.
