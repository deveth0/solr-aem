He was born in [[New Britain, Connecticut]] and graduated from [[Yale]] in 1762.

He married Elizabeth Lee and had at least one son and one daughter. He was elected to the [[Massachusetts]] General Court in both October of that year and in 1775.

In April 1775 when work reached the [[Berkshire County, Massachusetts|Berkshires]], Col. John Paterson marched with his [[Massachusetts militia|militia]] unit to besiege the [[British Army]] at [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Col. Paterson regiment now called the [[1st Massachusetts Regiment]] saw action at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. After the British evacuation of Boston, Col. Paterson and his regiment were ordered to take part in the [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|Invasion of Canada]] and the battles of [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] in [[New Jersey]]. On February 21, 1777 John Paterson was promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier-General]] in the [[Continental Army]].

In 1777 during the [[Saratoga Campaign]] Gen.
