&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Dutton Conant Little&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 1, 1928&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;hauser&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite doi|10.1007/978-1-4419-6281-2_36}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;)  is an [[Institute Professor]] at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;
[http://sloancf.mit.edu/vpf/popup-if.cfm?in_spseqno=69&amp;amp;co_list=F Little&amp;apos;s bio at MIT Sloan]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; best known for his result in [[operations research]], [[Little&amp;apos;s law]].

Born in [[Boston]],&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;hauser&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; he earned a [[Scientiæ Baccalaureus|S.B.]] in [[physics]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (1948)&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;hauser&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; and worked at [[General Electric]] (1948–50).  His [[Ph.D.]] on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Use of Storage Water in a [[Hydroelectric]] System&amp;apos;&amp;apos; used [[dynamic programming]], and advised by [[Philip M. Morse]], was the first ever awarded in [[operations research]] (1955).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=63575}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
Next, he taught at [[Case Western Reserve]] (1957–62) before joining the faculty at [[MIT]] (1962) where he since has worked. He was visiting professor at [[INSEAD]] (1988)

His earlier research in [[operations research]] involved traffic signal control, and gave him fame as he formed the [[Little&amp;apos;s law]] in 1961. It states: &amp;quot;The average number of customers in a system (over some interval) is equal to their average arrival rate, multiplied by their average time in the system.&amp;quot;  A corollary has been added: &amp;quot;The average time in the system is equal to the average time in queue plus the average time it takes to receive service.&amp;quot;
Little is considered to be a founder of [[marketing]] science,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://spectrum.mit.edu/issue/2006-summer/john-little/  John Little, The greatest of MIT&amp;apos;s great faculty] from spectrum.mit.edu (summer 2006)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; having conducted fundamental research in models of individual choice behavior, adaptive control of promotional spending, and marketing mix models for consumer packaged goods.
He has also started companies such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Management Decisions Systems&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kana Software&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;John D. C. Little Award&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is awarded annually by [[INFORMS]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.informs.org/article.php?id=612 John D. C.
