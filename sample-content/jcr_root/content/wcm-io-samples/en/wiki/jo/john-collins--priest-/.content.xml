{{About|the Anglican canon|the American Catholic chaplain|John A. Collins}}
[[File:canoncollins.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright|right|Canon Collins at an [[anti-nuclear]] rally in Trafalgar Square, London in February 1961]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Collins&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1905–1982) was an [[Anglican]] priest who was active in several radical political movements in the [[United Kingdom]].

Educated at [[Cranbrook School, Kent|Cranbrook School]], [[Kent]] and the [[University of Cambridge]], Collins served as a chaplain in the [[Royal Air Force]] during [[World War II]] and was radicalised by the experience.  In 1946, he founded the organization [[Christian Action]] to work for reconciliation with [[Germany]].  He was appointed as a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[St Paul&amp;apos;s Cathedral]], [[London]] in 1948, an office he held for 33 years.  Shortly afterwards he became disturbed by the newly developing [[apartheid]] system in [[South Africa]].

In 1951, Collins was one of the four founders of the charity [[War on Want]] which fights global poverty. In 1956, he committed Christian Action to raising funds for the defence of anti-apartheid activists accused of treason in South Africa and this gave rise to the [[Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa]]. The fund raised over £75,000 to help defend the accused during the [[Treason Trial]]

Collins was strongly opposed to the spread of [[nuclear weapon]]s and was one of many on the [[Left-wing|left]] in Britain who believed that it was unnecessary and wrong for Britain to own such weapons. He was one of the founders of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].  He was also a member of the [[Anglican Pacifist Fellowship]], working with the Reverend [[Sidney Hinkes]] on anti-nuclear campaigns.

The [[Canon Collins Educational &amp;amp; Legal Assistance Trust]], formerly known as Canon Collins Trust for Southern Africa (CCETSA) is a [[Charitable organization|charity]] founded in 1981. It was set up as the [[Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa]] and Collins was its first chairman.  In the days of apartheid it provided money to help South African and [[Namibia]]n refugee students gain the [[higher education]] in the United Kingdom and in independent African states.  It now provides scholarships for students within South Africa and in other African countries.

==Family==
Collins married [[Diana Collins|Diana Clavering Elliot]] (1917–2003) in 1939; they had four sons. Diana Collins was knighted in 1999 as a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]].
