&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Joseph Francis Fletcher&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 10, 1905, [[Newark, New Jersey]] – October 28, 1991, [[Charlottesville, Virginia]])&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;John R. Shook, [http://books.google.gr/books?id=Ijpj1tB3Qr0C&amp;amp;pg= &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dictionary Of Modern American Philosophers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;], Vol. 1, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005, p. 803&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was an American professor who founded the theory of [[situational ethics]] in the 1960s, and was a pioneer in the field of [[bioethics]]. Fletcher was a leading academic involved in the topics of [[abortion]], [[infanticide]], [[euthanasia]], [[eugenics]], and [[cloning]]. Ordained as an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] priest, he later identified himself as an [[atheist]].  {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Fletcher was a prolific professor, teaching, participating in symposia, and completing ten books, and hundreds of articles, book reviews, and translations.

He taught &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Christian Ethics&amp;apos;&amp;apos; at [[Episcopal Divinity School]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]],  and at [[Harvard Divinity School]] from 1944 to 1970. He was the first professor of medical ethics at the [[University of Virginia]] and co-founded the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Program in Biology and Society&amp;apos;&amp;apos; there. He retired from teaching in 1977.

In 1974, the [[American Humanist Association]] named him Humanist of the Year.  He was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=American Humanist Association | accessdate=October 14, 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He served as president of the Euthanasia Society of America (later renamed the Society for the Right to Die) from 1974 to 1976.  He was also a member of the [[American Eugenics Society]] and the [[EngenderHealth|Association for Voluntary Sterilization]].

== Quotes ==
&amp;quot;We need to educate people to the idea that the quality of life is more important than mere length of life. Our cultural tradition holds that life has absolute value, but that is really not good enough anymore. Sometimes, no life is better.&amp;quot;{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

&amp;quot;Ethics critically examines values and how they are to be acted out; but whether they are acted out or not, loyalty to them depends on character or personal quality, and so it follows that the quality of medicine depends on the character of its clinicians.&amp;quot;{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

&amp;quot;We ought to love people and use things; the essence of immorality is to love things and use people.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;People [with children with [[Down&amp;apos;s syndrome]]]... have no reason to feel guilty about putting a Down&amp;apos;s syndrome baby away, whether it&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;put away&amp;quot; in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium or in a more responsible lethal sense. It is sad; yes. Dreadful. But it carries no guilt. True guilt arises only from an offense against a person, and a Down&amp;apos;s is not a person.&amp;quot; &amp;lt;ref name=Bard&amp;gt;{{cite journal|last=Bard|first=Bernard|coauthors=Joseph Fletcher|title=The Right to Die|journal=The Atlantic Monthly|date=April 1968|year=1968|pages=59–64|url=http://www.riverbendds.org/index.htm?page=fletcher.html}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
