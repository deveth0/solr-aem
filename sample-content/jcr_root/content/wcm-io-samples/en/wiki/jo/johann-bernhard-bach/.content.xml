&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Johann Bernhard Bach&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (23 May 1676{{spaced ndash}}11 June 1749) was a German composer, and second cousin of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Sojurn&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Smith, Timothy A. [http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~tas3/jbbach.html &amp;quot;Johann Bernhard Bach 1676-1749&amp;quot;]. Northern Arizona University. Retrieved 3 August 2012.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was born in [[Erfurt]], and his early musical education was by his father, [[Johann Aegidius Bach]]. He took up his position as [[organ (music)|organ]]ist in Erfurt in 1695, and then took a similar position in [[Magdeburg]]. He replaced [[Johann Christoph Bach]] as organist in [[Eisenach]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Boyd|first=Malcolm|title=Oxford Composer Companions: J.S. Bach|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=0-19-866208-4|pages=32}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  and also as [[harpsichord]]ist in the court orchestra in 1703. Most of his musical output has been lost, but amongst his surviving music there are four orchestral suites. It is known that J.S. Bach had individual parts prepared for performance by his orchestra.

His musical style has been described as being similar to that of [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Sojurn&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

The surviving orchestral suites ([[overture]]s) are as follows:
*Suite No. 1 in G minor
*Suite No. 2 in G major
*Suite No. 3 in E minor
*Suite No. 4 in D major

They are thought to have been written before 1730.

Surviving keyboard music:

In addition to several organ chorales and 2 [[chaconne]]s, there are also 2 fugues by J.B. Bach.
