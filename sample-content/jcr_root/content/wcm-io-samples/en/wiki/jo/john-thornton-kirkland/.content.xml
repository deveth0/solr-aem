&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Thornton Kirkland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (August 17, 1770 – April 26, 1840) served as [[President of Harvard University]] from 1810 to 1828. A religious minister like many of his predecessors, he is remembered chiefly for his lenient treatment of students.  [[Kirkland House]], one of Harvard&amp;apos;s undergraduate &amp;quot;houses,&amp;quot; or residence halls, was named in his honor and in recognition of his term at the school&amp;apos;s helm.

[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] describes him thus, in his study of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]: &amp;quot;His &amp;apos;shining morning face&amp;apos; was round as a baby&amp;apos;s, and talked as pleasantly as his voice did, with smiles for accents and dimples for punctuation.... It was of him that the story was always told,--it may be as old as the invention of printing,--that he threw his sermons into a barrel, where they went to pieces and got mixed up, and that when he was going to preach he fished out what he thought would be about enough for a sermon, and patched the leaves together as he best might.&amp;quot;

His contemporary [[George Ticknor]] described Kirkland&amp;apos;s sermons as &amp;quot;full of intellectual wealth and practical wisdom, with sometimes a quaintness that bordered on humor.&amp;quot;

Kirkland served as pastor of the [[New South Church (Boston, Massachusetts)|New South Church]] in Boston, 1794–1810.
