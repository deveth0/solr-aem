        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sir John II Stanley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (c. 1386&amp;amp;ndash;1437) was [[Knight]], [[Sheriff]] of [[Anglesey]], [[Constable]] of [[Caernarfon|Carnarvon]], [[Justice of the Peace|Justice]] of [[Chester]], [[Steward (office)|Steward]] of [[Macclesfield]] and titular &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[King of Mann]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the second of that name.

==Biography==
His father Sir [[John I Stanley of the Isle of Man|John Stanley]], [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], had been granted the tenure of the [[Isle of Man]], to him and his heirs, by [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], and the younger Sir John succeeded to the Kingdom in 1414.
He also held the office of Steward of [[Macclesfield]], [[Cheshire]].

He twice visited the Island to put down rebellions (1417 and 1422) and was also responsible for putting the laws of the Island into writing. A brief description is given in [http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/manxnb/index.htm Manx Notebook] (vol iii p1-4).

[[Arthur William Moore|A. W. Moore]], a Manx antiquary and [[Speaker of the House of Keys]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/people/antiqarn/awmoore.htm A.W. Moore&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; appraised him as follows:

{{cquote|He may justly be considered an enlightened and upright ruler, much in advance of his time. He caused the ancient laws and constitutions of his little kingdom to be reduced to writing, he humbled the overbearing ecclesiastical authorities, and, after he had practically concentrated all power into his own hands, he wisely conceded a representative form of government.{{cn|date=May 2011}} }}

He purchased the [[Advowson]] of Rectory of [[Winwick, Cheshire]] from the [[Nostell Priory]], [[Wakefield]] in 1433 - from this time onwards, this church, adjacent to his property, was to have close links with the Stanley family.

==Family==
He married Elizabeth Harrington, daughter of Sir Nicholas Harrington.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Douglas Richardson. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Plantagenet Ancestry: A Study In Colonial And Medieval Families,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 2nd Edition, 2011. pg 265.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
One of his sons was Sir [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley]], and a grandson was [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]].
