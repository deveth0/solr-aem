&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Hill Burton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[FRSE]] (22 August 1809 – 10 August 1881) was a Scottish [[advocate]], historian and economist. The author of &amp;quot;Life and Correspondence of [[David Hume]]&amp;quot;, he was secretary of the [[Scottish Prison Board]] (1854-77), and [[Historiographer Royal]] (1867-1881).

Burton was born in [[Aberdeen]], the son of W K Burton{{fact|date=February 2013}}&amp;lt;!--That&amp;apos;s his son&amp;apos;s name--&amp;gt; by his spouse Eliza Paton. He was educated at [[Aberdeen Grammar School]] and [[Marischal College]]. After graduating, he moved to [[Edinburgh]] and studied for the Bar, being admitted to the [[Faculty of Advocates]] in 1831. However, he had little practice, and in 1854 was appointed Secretary to the [[Prison Board of Scotland]], and in 1877 a [[Prison Commission (Scotland)|Commissioner of Prisons]].

He became at an early period of his life a contributor to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Blackwood&amp;apos;s Magazine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and other periodicals, and in 1846 published a life of [[David Hume]], which attracted considerable attention, and was followed by Lives of [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]] and Lord President [[Duncan Forbes (judge)|Forbes]]. He began his career as a [[historian]] by the publication in 1853 of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;History of Scotland from the Revolution to the Extinction of the last Jacobite Insurrection&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, to which he added (1867-70) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;History of Scotland from Agricola&amp;apos;s Invasion to the Revolution&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in 7 vols., thus completing a continuous narrative. Subsequently he published a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;History of the Reign of Queen Anne&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1880). Other works of a lighter kind were &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Book-Hunter&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1862), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Scot Abroad]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1864). Burton&amp;apos;s historical works display much research and a spirit of candour and honesty, and have picturesque and spirited passages, but the style is unequal, and frequently lacks dignity.  Nevertheless, he was one of the first historians to introduce the principles of historical research into the study and writing of the history of Scotland.

John Hill Burton married Isabella, née Lauder (born 1810) in 1844. She died in 1850. He remarried in 1855 to Katherine, daughter of [[Cosmo Innes]], who gave birth the next year to [[W. K. Burton]]. Burton [[wikt:p%C3%A8re#English|père]] died at [[Morton House (Edinburgh)|Morton House]], Edinburgh. He was interred in [[Dalmeny]] Cemetery, but a monument to him, his wife&amp;lt;!--Which one?--&amp;gt; and children is in [[Dean Cemetery]] where they are buried.
