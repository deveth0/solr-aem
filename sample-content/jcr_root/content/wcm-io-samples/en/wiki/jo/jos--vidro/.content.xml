&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;José Angel Vidro&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born August 27, 1974 in [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico]]) is a former [[Major League Baseball]] [[second baseman]]. Though he never officially retired, Vidro has not played since {{by|2008}}.

==Professional career==

===Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals===
Vidro was drafted in the sixth round of the 1992 amateur draft by the [[Montreal Expos]] from Sabana Grande PR high school Blanca Malaret. He spent four seasons in the [[minor leagues]] before making his major league debut on June 8, 1997. He was primarily a reserve infielder for the Expos in 1997 and 1998. Vidro is the first of three players ([[Robinson Cancel]]-New York Mets, [[Jonathan Sanchez]]-San Francisco Giants) from [[Sabana Grande]], PR to make it to the Major Leagues.

In 1999, Vidro became a full-time player as the Expos starting second baseman. He [[Batting average|hit]] .304 with 12 [[home run]]s and 59 [[Run batted in|RBI]] and was second in the [[National League]] with 45 [[Double (baseball)|doubles]].

In 2000, Vidro was named an All-Star for the first time in his career. His career high .330 batting average was seventh best in the NL. His 200 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] were 2nd best in the NL and his 51 doubles on the season were good for 3rd best. He also set career high numbers in homers with 24 and RBI with 97. Vidro continued as the starting second baseman for the Expos in 2001 when he hit .319 with 15 homers and 59 RBI.

Vidro made the NL All-Star team in both 2002 and 2003, hitting over .300 both seasons and winning the [[Silver Slugger]] as the best hitting 2nd baseman in the NL in 2003. Vidro played 3 more seasons with the franchise, including the first two seasons when the Expos moved and became the [[Washington Nationals]]. Due to injuries to his right knee, ankle, and quadriceps muscle, Vidro played in only 87 games for the [[Washington Nationals]] in 2005, 8 of which were as a [[pinch hitter]].

===Seattle Mariners===
On December 14, 2006, the Nationals traded Vidro to the [[Seattle Mariners]] for [[outfielder]] [[Chris Snelling]] and [[pitcher]] [[Emiliano Fruto]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2696991 |title=Report: M&amp;apos;s, Nats have tentative deal on Vidro trade |accessdate=2009-01-16 |author=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 13, 2006 |publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Vidro spent two seasons with Seattle primarily playing DH. He hit .314 in 147 games in 2007; but, had only 6 homers while [[Slugging percentage|slugging]] .394.

On August 5, 2008, the Mariners designated Vidro for assignment, and he was released on August 13. He was hitting .234 with seven home runs and 45 RBI at the time.
