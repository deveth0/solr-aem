        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John X Kamateros&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-el|Ἰωάννης Καματηρός}}) was the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] from 5 August 1198 to April/May 1206.

John was a member of the [[Kamateros]] family, to which belonged the Empress [[Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera]], wife of [[Alexios III Angelos]] (r. 1195–1203). An educated man, well versed in classical literature, rhetoric and philosophy, he occupied a series of ecclesiastical posts reaching the post of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[chartophylax]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which he held at the time of his elevation to the patriarchal throne.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 1054&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1198–1200 he had an exchange of letters with [[Pope Innocent III]] on the issue of [[papal supremacy]] and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[filioque]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; clause. Notably, he disputed Rome&amp;apos;s claim to primacy based on [[St Peter]], and asserted that in reality its primacy came from the fact that Rome was the old imperial capital.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Kazhdan (1991), pp. 1054–1055&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He intervened in the riots in Constantinople against the arrest of the banker Kalomodios, and secured his release,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Kazhdan (1991), pp. 1055, 1096&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; but during the coup of [[John Komnenos the Fat]] on 31 July 1200, he hid in a cupboard as the rebels seized control of the [[Hagia Sophia]].

John remained in office after Alexios III&amp;apos;s deposition in July 1203, and according to Western sources, both he and [[Alexios IV Angelos]], threatened by the [[Fourth Crusade]], acknowledged papal supremacy in the same year. After the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|capture]] of [[Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, he initially fled to [[Didymoteichon]] in [[Thrace]]. In 1206, [[Theodore I Laskaris]] invited him to [[Nicaea]], where he had established the [[Empire of Nicaea]], a Byzantine Greek successor state, but John refused, perhaps because of his advanced age, and died in April or May of the same year.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 1055&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The Crusaders then installed a [[Latin Patriarch of Constantinople|Latin Patriarch]] in Constantinople, while Theodore simply created a new Greek Patriarchate in Nicaea, which was eventually restored in Constantinople with the rest of the Empire in 1261.
