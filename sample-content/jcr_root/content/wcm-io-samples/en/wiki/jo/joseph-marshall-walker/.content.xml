&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Joseph Marshall Walker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (July 1, 1784 – January 20, 1856) was a [[Louisiana]] [[soldier]] and [[politician]]. He was the [[List of Governors of Louisiana|13th Governor of Louisiana]], from 1850-1853.

Walker was born to an [[England|English]] father and a [[France|French]]-[[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] mother in the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. At that time [[Louisiana]] was a [[colony]] of [[Spain]]. In 1807, he went to Mexico and joined the Spanish army, serving as a lieutenant of dragoons, and later becoming master of a military school at Chihuahua.

After the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]] he returned to New Orleans and enlisted in the Louisiana State [[Militia]]. He served fighting against the [[United Kingdom|British]] in the [[Battle of New Orleans]] at [[Chalmette, Louisiana]].

==Political career==
A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he was first elected to public office in 1820, as a member of [[Louisiana House of Representatives|the House of Representatives of Louisiana]].

On January 22, 1822, he was made [[Brigadier General]] of the First Brigade of the State Militia, serving concurrently with his role as a member of the state house.

Walker was reelected to the legislature in 1822, 1832, and 1836. He was active in promoting the State Militia, and was credited with improving the organization and discipline of that force.

In 1846 he served as State Treasurer.

In 1849 he ran for Governor, winning against split [[United States Whig Party|Whig]] opposition from General [[Alexander De Clouet]] and [[Duncan F. Kenner]]. On 28 January 1850, he became the first governor inaugurated in the new state capital at [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]].

As governor he established a free [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system for [[whites|white]] children.

There was widespread opposition to the 1846 State [[Constitution]], and a convention adopted a new one in 1852. Walker strongly objected to this document, and resigned because of this the following year, and retired to a family [[plantation]] in [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides Parish]]. He turned down offers from Democratic Party officials to be their candidate for the [[United States House of Representatives]].  Joseph Marshall Walker died three years later in 1856.
