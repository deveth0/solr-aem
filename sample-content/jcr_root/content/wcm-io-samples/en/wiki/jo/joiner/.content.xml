In the building trades, a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;joiner&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a type of a [[Carpentry|carpenter]] that cuts and fits [[Woodworking joint|joints]] in [[wood]] without the use of [[Nail (fastener)|nails]], [[screws]], or other metal [[fastener]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Joiners usually work in a workshop, because the formation of various joints usually requires non-portable machinery; in contrast, most other kinds of carpenter usually work on site. A &amp;quot;joiner&amp;quot; usually produces items such as interior and exterior doors, windows, stairs, tables, bookshelves etc.; [[Cabinet making|cabinet makers]] are often regarded as producers of fine joinery.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The terms &amp;apos;&amp;apos;joinery&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;joiner&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are obsolete in the USA,{{vn|date=December 2011}} although the main trade union for carpenters still calls itself the [[United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America]].

In the UK, an apprentice of wood occupations could choose to study &amp;apos;&amp;apos;bench joinery&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;site carpentry and joinery&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; bench joinery is the preparation, setting out, and manufacture of joinery components, while site carpentry and joinery focuses on the installation of the joinery components, and on the setting out and fabrication of timber elements used in [[construction]].
