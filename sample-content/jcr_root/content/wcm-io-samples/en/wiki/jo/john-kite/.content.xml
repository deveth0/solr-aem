&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Kite&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (died 1537) was successively [[Archbishop of Armagh (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Armagh]], 1513&amp;amp;ndash;1521, and [[Bishop of Carlisle]], 1521&amp;amp;ndash;1537.

John Kite was educated at [[Eton College]] and then at [[King&amp;apos;s College, Cambridge]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Venn|id=KT480J|name=Kite, John}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; where he was graduated Bachelor of [[Canon Law]]. He was appointed a [[prebendary]] of [[Exeter Cathedral]] and [[dean (religion)|Sub-Dean]] of the [[Westminster Abbey|King&amp;apos;s Chapel, Westminster]] in 1510. From 1510-1518 he was [[prebendary]] of Stratton in the [[diocese of Salisbury]].

In 1518, as [[archbishop]], he accompanied [[John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners]] on an embassy to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] of [[Spain]] and was present at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]] in 1520. In 1522 he was living at [[Rose Castle]], [[Cumberland, England|Cumberland]] when he was visited by Dr [[William Burbank]], [[Archdeacon]] of [[Carlisle Cathedral]], of whom he wrote to [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]]. His alliance with Wolsey may explain his quick promotion. He took the [[Oath of Supremacy]] in 1534.
