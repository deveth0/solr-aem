&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Joe Rush&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1960) influenced by the film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mad Max&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Judge Dredd]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; comics,  was the co-originator of the travelling multi media art group [[Eat my face]], an [[underground art]] collective who specialised in building large scale [[Installation art|installations]] out of waste material.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |title=&amp;apos;I mutate waste, it&amp;apos;s creative chaos&amp;apos; |first=Paul |last=Lewis |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 April 2008 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/audio/2008/apr/21/paul.lewis.junkyard.glastonbury |accessdate= }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |title=Bringing the Streets to the Saleroom: Urban Art Back at Bonhams |work=[[Huffington Post]]  |date=21 September 2011 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/20/bringing-the-streets-to-t_n_972689.html |accessdate= }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |title=Glastonbury festival 2011 gets ready â€“ in pictures |work=The Guardian |date=20 June 2011 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/gallery/2011/jun/20/glastonbury-festival-2011-in-pictures |accessdate= }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Throughout the eighties he built techno-industrial sculptures at parties and [[festivals]], and then travelled across both Western and Eastern Europe to continue the work. From making a &amp;quot;car henge&amp;quot; at Glastonbury (stone circle made out of cars), he progressed to using armoured personnel carriers and fighter planes in Germany after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]]. Joe is one of the most innovative and influential artists in the UK. After leaving Britain for many years, he returned to the UK where he and his crew became involved with robotics and animation, as well as organising [[Mutoid Waste Company]] projects around the world.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |title=The fun, the filth and the fury |first=Patrick |last=Barkham |work=The Guardian |date=23 March 2006 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2006/mar/24/glastonbury2005.glastonbury |accessdate= }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He has had other art displayed around the country, like &amp;quot;X-Ray Ted Mosquito&amp;quot; as part of [http://www.liverpooldiscovers.co.uk/2011/01/joe-rush/ Liverpool Discovers 2011].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |title=This week&amp;apos;s new events |first=Colette |last=Bernhardt |work=The Guardian |date=19 February 2011 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/feb/19/this-weeks-new-events |accessdate=8 September 2012 |quote=Joe Rush&amp;apos;s X-Ray Ted mosquito honours the city as the first to use x-rays and understand malaria }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He is not to be confused with the British washboard player and percussionist of the same name, who has played with [[Good Earth]], [[Mungo Jerry]], and the [[King Earl Boogie Band]].
