:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;For the American [[cricket]]er, see &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[John Lester]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Lester Wallack&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Johnstone Wallack&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (January 1, 1820 New York, NY &amp;amp;ndash; September 6, 1888 Stamford, CT), was an [[United States|American]] [[actor]] and son of [[James William Wallack]].&amp;lt;ref name=matt&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=waIVAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;dq=%22Macauley&amp;apos;s+Theatre%22&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Brander Matthews et al. (1900) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Edwin Booth and His Contemporaries&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Vol. 5, L.C. Page &amp;amp; Co., Boston]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He was born in New York but at an early age he was taken to his parents&amp;apos; home in London where he was reared and educated. He had chosen a military career but became discouraged and went to [[Dublin]] where he went upon the stage. He remained for two seasons and then went to [[Edinburgh]]. Then in 1846, he appeared in London at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] under [[Benjamin Webster]]&amp;apos;s management. There he was seen by an American manager&amp;apos;s agent who had come over to London to engage actors for the Broadway Theatre, New York. By him he was engaged and brought back to America in 1847.&amp;lt;ref name=matt/&amp;gt;

In the theatrical world he was known primarily as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lester Wallack&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. but when he made his first stage appearance in New York in 1847 it was under the name of John Lester when he appeared as Sir Charles Coldstream, in [[Dion Boucicault|Boucicault]]&amp;apos;s adaptation of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Used Up&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. His uncle Henry Wallack, the father of [[James William Wallack]], was also in the Broadway Theatre&amp;apos;s company. His second appearance was as Viscount de Ligny in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Captain of the Guard&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[James Planché]].&amp;lt;ref name=matt/&amp;gt;

Subsequently, he performed at the [[Bowery Theatre]], [[Burton&amp;apos;s Theatre]], [[Niblo&amp;apos;s Garden]] and [[Brougham&amp;apos;s Lyceum]]. His first appearance at the Bowery Theatre was in 1849 as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Don Caesar de Bazan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Adolphe d&amp;apos;Ennery]] and [[Philippe  Dumanoir]].&amp;lt;ref name=matt/&amp;gt;

He was manager, using the name Wallack, of the second [[Wallack&amp;apos;s Theatre]] from 1861, and in 1882 he opened the third at 30th Street and [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]]. This theatre was torn down in 1915. Among the productions staged at this theater was [[Margaret Mather]]&amp;apos;s ill-fated production of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Cymbeline]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1897. Another [[Wallack&amp;apos;s Theatre]] at 254 West 42nd Street in New York was named for him in 1924.

His greatest successes were as [[The School for Scandal|Charles Surface]], as [[Much Ado About Nothing|Benedick]], and especially as Elliot Grey in his own play &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rosedale&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and similar light comedy and romantic parts, for which his fascinating manners and handsome person well fitted him. He married a sister (d. 1909) of [[John Everett Millais|Sir John Millais]]. He wrote his own &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Memories of Fifty Years&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
