&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Young&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (June 12, 1802 &amp;amp;ndash; April 23, 1852) was an [[United States|American]] [[politician]].

He was born in [[Chelsea, Vermont]]. As a child, he moved to Freeport (now [[Conesus, New York|Conesus]]), [[Livingston County, New York]].  He had only basic schooling but, by self-study accumulated a knowledge of classics and became a law clerk, becoming admitted to the bar in 1829.  He entered politics as a [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian Democrat]], but shortly afterward joined the [[Anti-Masonic Party]]. He was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] (Livingston Co.) in [[55th New York State Legislature|1832]].

Young was elected as a [[United States Whig Party|Whig]] to the [[24th United States Congress]], to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of [[Philo C. Fuller]], holding office from November 1836 to March 3, 1837. He was again elected to the [[27th United States Congress]], holding office from March 4, 1841, to March 3, 1843.

He was again a member of the State Assembly (Livingston Co.) in [[68th New York State Legislature|1845]] and [[69th New York State Legislature|1846]], and was urged to run on the Whig ticket against the incumbent Governor [[Silas Wright]]. He unseated Wright, and was Governor of New York from January 1847 until the end of 1848.

In 1848, he became a strong supporter of [[Zachary Taylor]]&amp;apos;s candidacy for [[President of the United States]] and was rewarded, after Taylor&amp;apos;s victory, by appointment as Assistant [[Treasurer of the United States]] in [[New York City]]. He served in the latter post until his death from [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 49.
