&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jonathan Penrose&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 7 October 1933, in [[Colchester]]) is an English chess player, [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]], and [[International Correspondence Chess Grandmaster]] (1983) who won the [[British Chess Championship]] ten times between 1958 and 1969. He is the son of [[Lionel Penrose]], a world famous professor of genetics, and brother of [[Roger Penrose]] and [[Oliver Penrose]]. He is a [[psychologist]] and university lecturer by profession.

Learning the game at age four, he was a member of [[Hampstead]] Chess Club at twelve and British Boys (Under 18) Champion at just fourteen years of age. Chess was played by the entire Penrose family. His father was a composer of endgame studies and a strong player, as was older brother Oliver.

By the age of seventeen, he was already acknowledged as a top prospect for British chess. Playing [[Hastings International Chess Congress|Hastings]] for the first time in 1950/51, he beat the French champion [[Nicolas Rossolimo]] and at [[Southsea]] in 1950, defeated both [[Efim Bogoljubov]] and [[Savielly Tartakower]].

Penrose earned the [[International Master]] title in 1961 and was the leading British player for several years in the 1960s and early 1970s, surpassing the achievement of [[Henry Ernest Atkins]] by winning the British Championship a record number of times. He was widely considered to be of grandmaster (GM) strength, if not world class standard, but did not achieve the GM title in over-the-board play, despite some notable victories. This was mainly due to his choosing to remain amateur and placing his lecturing as a first priority. In effect, it meant that he played few international tournaments and frequently turned down invitations to prestigious tournaments such as Hastings.

He competed in every [[Chess Olympiad]] between 1952 and 1962, then at the Olympiads of 1968 and 1970, frequently posting excellent scores, including +9 -1 =7 in 1962 ([[Varna]]), and +10 -0 =5 in 1968 ([[Lugano]]). On both of these occasions, he won an individual silver medal on first board; in 1968, his score was bettered only by the [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]], [[Tigran Petrosian]].

At the [[14th Chess Olympiad|Leipzig 1960 Olympiad]], he defeated new world champion [[Mikhail Tal]] with the white pieces in a [[Modern Benoni]]: &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c5 4.d5 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.e4 g6 7.Bd3 Bg7 8.Nge2 0-0 9.0-0 a6 10.a4 Qc7 11.h3 Nbd7 12.f4 Re8 13.Ng3 c4 14.Bc2 Nc5 15.Qf3 Nfd7 16.Be3 b5 17.axb5 Rb8 18.Qf2 axb5 19.e5 dxe5 20.f5 Bb7 21.Rad1 Ba8 22.Nce4 Na4 23.Bxa4 bxa4 24.fxg6 fxg6 25.Qf7+ Kh8 26.Nc5 Qa7 27.Qxd7 Qxd7 28.Nxd7 Rxb2 29.Nb6 Rb3 30.Nxc4 Rd8 31.d6 Rc3 32.Rc1 Rxc1 33.Rxc1 Bd5 34.Nb6 Bb3 35.Ne4 h6 36.d7 Bf8 37.Rc8 Be7 38.Bc5 Bh4 39.g3 1â€“0&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;This victory made him the first British player to beat a world champion since [[Joseph Henry Blackburne]] defeated [[Emanuel Lasker]] in 1899.

Unfortunately, Penrose suffered from nerves and he collapsed at the [[19th Chess Olympiad|1970 Olympiad]] in the midst of a tense game. Consequently, he moved instead to [[correspondence chess]], where he was successful, earning the International Master (IMC) title in 1980 and the grandmaster (GMC) title in 1983. He was the best postal player in 1987-89 and led his country to victory in the 9th Correspondence Olympiad.[http://tables.iccf.com/world/olymp/ol-09f.htm]

Jonathan Penrose was awarded the [[OBE]] in 1971. He has two daughters from his marriage to Margaret Wood.
