        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;JoAnn Wilson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (21 August 1939 &amp;amp;ndash; 21 January 1983) was the wife of [[Canada|Canadian]] politician [[Colin Thatcher]] who murdered her after the end of their marriage.

Wilson was born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;JoAnn Geiger&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Osage, Iowa]] to Harlan and Betty Geiger. She met Colin while attending [[Iowa State University]] in 1960, and in 1962, the couple married and relocated to [[Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan]]. While Colin was pursuing his political ambitions, JoAnn helped raise their three children and worked variously as a [[teacher]], [[bookkeeper]], and [[interior designer]]. The Thatcher marriage began to sour in the late 1970s, culminating in physical abuse and finally a divorce. Colin continued to abuse and harass JoAnn even after her marriage to Tony Wilson on 3 January 1981.

Two years after an unsuccessful attempt on her life, JoAnn was found beaten and shot to death in the garage of her [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] home. After a lengthy police investigation, Thatcher was charged and convicted of the murder.
