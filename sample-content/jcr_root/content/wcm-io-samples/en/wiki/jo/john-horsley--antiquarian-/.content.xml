&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Horsley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (c. 1685&amp;amp;ndash;12 January 1732) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[antiquarian]], known primarily for his book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Britannia Romana]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Roman Antiquities of Britain&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which was published in 1732.


==Early life==
[[John Hodgson (antiquary)|John Hodgson]], in a memoir published in 1831, held that Horsley was born in 1685, at [[Pinkie House]], in the parish of [[Inveresk]], [[Midlothian]], and that his father was a Northumberland [[nonconformist]], who had migrated to [[Scotland]], but returned to England soon after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. John Hodgson Hinde, in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Archaeologia Aeliana]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of February 1865, held that he was a native of [[Newcastle-on-Tyne]], the son of Charles Horsley, a member of the Tailors&amp;apos; Company of the town. David Boyd Haycock writing in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; comments that none of the suggestions made for Horsley&amp;apos;s background is verifiable.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{ODNBweb|id=13819|title=Horsley, John|first=David Boyd|last=Haycock}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He was educated at the [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.seaham.i12.com/myers/m-horsley.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0075-4358(1932)22%3C161%3AJH%3E2.0.CO%3B2-G&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and at [[Edinburgh University]], where he graduated [[Master&amp;apos;s degree|MA]] on 29 April 1701. There is evidence that he &amp;quot;was settled in [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]] as a [[Presbyterian]] minister as early as 1709.&amp;quot; Hodgson, however, thought that up to 1721, at which time he was residing at [[Widdrington Station and Stobswood|Widdrington]], &amp;quot;he had not received ordination, but preached as a licentiate.&amp;quot;

==Educator==
Horsley communicated to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Philosophical Transactions]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; notes on the rainfall at Widdrington in the years 1722 and 1723. At Morpeth Horsley opened a private school, attracting pupils irrespective of religious connection, among them [[Newton Ogle]], later dean of Westminster. He gave lectures on [[mechanics]] and [[hydrostatics]] in Morpeth, [[Alnwick]] and Newcastle, and was elected  a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] on 23 April 1730, or in May, 1729.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;amp;dsqPos=0&amp;amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27horsley%27%29 |title = Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 21 November 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Death==
Horsley died of [[apoplexy]] on 12 January 1732, on the eve of the publication of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Britannia Romana&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Works==
It is as an archaeologist and antiquarian that Horsley is now known. His major work, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Britannia Romana]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Roman Antiquities of Britain&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was published in 1732. One of Horsley&amp;apos;s achievements in this book was to identify for the first time which [[Roman legion|legion]]s of the [[Roman army]] were stationed in Britain.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.ancient-warfare.com/pdf/web/AWIV-5/fateoftheninth.pdf Cf. Duncan Campbell&amp;apos;s article, p. 49 ]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; There was in the [[British Museum]] a copy of with notes by [[John Ward (academic)|John Ward]].

He also published two sermons and a handbook to his lectures on mechanics, etc., and projected a history of Northumberland and [[Durham]], collections for which were found among his papers.
