&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Lawrence Sullivan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (June 16, 1899 â€“ August 8, 1982) was [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy (AIR)]] 1946-47 and the first [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] in the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] Administration 1947-49.  He was appointed to that position upon [[James V. Forrestal|Secretary Forrestal]]&amp;apos;s installation as the first [[Secretary of Defense]].  He resigned in protest after the second Secretary of Defense, [[Louis A. Johnson]], canceled the heavy aircraft carrier [[USS United States (CVA-58)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;United States&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]]. This event was part of an [[Interservice rivalry|interservice conflict]] known as the [[Revolt of the Admirals]].

Sullivan&amp;apos;s major contributions to the Navy&amp;apos;s future directions include the advent of naval nuclear propulsion.  In 1947, then-Captain [[Hyman G. Rickover]] [[Hyman_G._Rickover#Naval reactors and the Atomic Energy Commission|went around his chain-of-command]] and directly to the Chief of Naval Operations, [[Chester W. Nimitz|Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz]], by chance also a former submariner, to pitch his ideas for creating a nuclear-powered warship.  Nimitz immediately understood the potential of nuclear propulsion and recommended the project to Sullivan, whose endorsement to build the world&amp;apos;s first nuclear-powered vessel, [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nautilus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SSN-571)]], later caused Rickover to state that Sullivan was &amp;quot;the true father of the Nuclear Navy.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=rVMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA104&amp;amp;dq=Rickover&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=hcbsTpK3GeqtsAL8243CCQ&amp;amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Rickover&amp;amp;f=false LIFE magazine, September 8, 1958, page 108&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20111216-ENTERTAIN-112160303&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
