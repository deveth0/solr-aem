&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Alexander Mathieson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (May 19, 1863 &amp;amp;ndash; January 7, 1947) was a [[Prince Edward Island]] politician and jurist, the [[List of premiers of Prince Edward Island|12th]] [[Premier of Prince Edward Island|Premier]].

Mathieson was born in [[Harrington, Prince Edward Island|Harrington]] and was a graduate of [[Prince of Wales College]].  He was a schoolmaster and lawyer before entering politics with his election to the province&amp;apos;s [[legislature]] as a [[PEI Conservative Party|Conservative]] in 1900.

Mathieson sat on the [[parliamentary opposition|opposition]] benches becoming [[Leader of the Opposition (PEI)|leader of the opposition]] and the Conservative Party in 1903. In December 1911, the Liberal government resigned when [[Premier]] [[H. James Palmer]] was defeated in a [[by-election]] which also caused the governing [[PEI Liberal Party|Liberals]] to lose their [[majority government|majority]] in the legislature. The [[lieutenant-governor]] asked Mathieson as leader of the opposition to form a government, which he did, going on to win a mandate in the 1912 general election.

Mathieson&amp;apos;s government pressed the federal government to fulfill the terms on which Prince Edward Island joined [[Canadian confederation]] in 1873. He succeeded in persuading Ottawa to provide an improved annual subsidy to the province and, in 1915, Ottawa announced the creation of a year round ferry service to connect the island to the mainland. The ferries began operating between PEI and [[New Brunswick]] in 1917.

The province was also at risk of losing representation in the [[Canadian House of Commons]] due to population shifts. PEI had six [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s when it joined confederation in 1873, this was reduced to four and was to be cut further as a result of the 1911 census. Mathieson persuaded the federal government to agree to an amendment to the [[British North America Act]] guaranteeing the province a minimum of four MPs in perpetuity.

In 1917, Premier Mathieson left politics to accept an appointment as [[Chief Justice]] of Prince Edward Island and served in that position until he retired in 1943.
