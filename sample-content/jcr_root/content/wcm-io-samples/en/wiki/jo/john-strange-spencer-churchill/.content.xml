{{Other people|John Spencer-Churchill}}
[[Major]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Strange &amp;quot;Jack&amp;quot; Spencer-Churchill&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Territorial Decoration|TD]] (4 February 1880 – 23 February 1947) was the younger brother of former [[ Prime Minister of United Kingdom]] [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]]. Lady Randolph&amp;apos;s sisters believed that John&amp;apos;s biological father was Evelyn Boscawen, 7th [[Viscount Falmouth]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Anne Sebba, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;American Jennie: The Remarkable Life of Lady Randolph Churchill&amp;quot;, Norton, 2008&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Early life and marriage ==

He was born at [[Phoenix Park]], [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], where his father was secretary to his grandfather, the [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]], who had been appointed [[Viceroy of Ireland]] in 1876. John was educated at [[Harrow School]] in England.

He married, in [[Oxford]] on 8 August 1908, Lady Gwendoline Theresa Mary Bertie (20 November 1885 – 7 July 1941), a [[Roman Catholic]], the daughter of [[Montagu Bertie, 7th Earl of Abingdon]] and Gwendoline Mary Dormer.

==Military career==

He was [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]]ed into the [[Queen&amp;apos;s Own Oxfordshire Hussars]] in 1898. He served in the [[South African Light Horse]] alongside his [[war correspondent]] brother in the [[Second Boer War]] between 1899 and 1900, where he was [[Mentioned in Dispatches]], and shot through the leg during the [[Battle of the Tugela Heights]], part of the campaign for the [[relief of Ladysmith]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Churchill, W.S. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[London to Ladysmith via Pretoria]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; London: Longmans, Green &amp;amp; Co. 1900, p. 168-9&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He fought in the [[World War I|First World War]], where he was again Mentioned in Dispatches. He also served on the staff of [[Field Marshal]] [[John Denton Pinkstone French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Lord French]], General Sir [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Ian Hamilton]] (serving as Naval Liaison Officer for the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force) and Field Marshal [[William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood|Lord Birdwood]] (serving as Camp Commandant, 1st [[Anzac]] Corps, and then as Assistant Military Secretary at the headquarters of the Fifth Army). He reached the rank of [[Major]] and was awarded the [[France|French]] decorations of the [[Croix de guerre 1914-1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] and the [[Légion d&amp;apos;Honneur]] and the British [[Distinguished Service Order]] in 1918.

After the war, he became a businessman in the [[City of London]].

John and his brother Winston were very close; and he and his children spent a lot of time with his brother&amp;apos;s family at [[Chartwell]] and other residences.

During the [[Second World War]] the widowed John lost his house during [[the Blitz]] and he lived in [[10 Downing Street]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Mary Soames]] in her edition of the Churchill letters.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He lived in either No 10 (where he used the bedrooms on the top floor formerly used by Churchill and his wife) or the No 10 Annex.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Churchill’s Bunker&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by Richard Holmes, pp82, 107 (2009, Profile Books)  ISBN 978-1-84668-225-4&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He died of a heart disease&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Mary Soames&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and is buried near his parents and brother at [[St Martin&amp;apos;s Church, Bladon]], near [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire]].

==Children==
The couple had three children:

* [[John George Spencer-Churchill (artist)|John George Spencer-Churchill]] (31 May 1909–1992)
* Henry Winston Peregrine Spencer-Churchill (25 May 1913 – 19 March 2002)
* [[Clarissa Eden, Countess of Avon|Anne Clarissa Churchill]], Countess of Avon (born 28 June 1920), the widow of the former prime minister [[Anthony Eden]].

Despite the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ne Temere]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; decree, apparently only their daughter was brought up as a Catholic, the faith of her mother (herself the daughter of a convert).
