&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Penn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (May 17, 1741 â€“ September 14, 1788) was a signer of both the [[United States]] [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Articles of Confederation]] as a representative of [[North Carolina]].

==Early life==
Penn was born near [[Port Royal, Virginia|Port Royal]] in [[Caroline County, Virginia]], an only child of Moses Penn and Catherine [Taylor] Penn. He attended at common school for only two years as his father did not consider education to be important.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Goodrich, Rev. Charles A.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lives of the Signers to the Declaration of Independence.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; New York: William Reed &amp;amp; Co., 1856. Pages 433-435&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; At age 18, after his father&amp;apos;s death, Penn privately [[read law]] with his uncle, [[Edmund Pendleton]]. He became a lawyer in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] in 1762. In 1774, Penn moved to the [[Williamsborough, North Carolina]] area, where he practiced law.

===Relations===
On July 28, 1763, Penn married Susannah Lyne. The couple had two&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.dsdi1776.com/Signers/John%20Penn.html DSDI 1776]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; children. Their daughter, Lucy, married [[John Taylor of Caroline]], a political leader from Virginia.

==Political career==
Penn was elected to the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress]] and elected by that body to the [[Continental Congress]] in 1775, serving until 1780. For the 1776 signing of the Declaration of Independence, he was part of the North Carolina delegation that included [[Joseph Hewes]] and [[William Hooper]]. In 1777, Penn was one of the state&amp;apos;s signers of the Articles of Confederation. Penn also served on the [[Board of War]] until 1780, when he retired to once again practice law. He served as receiver of taxes for North Carolina in 1784. When Penn died in 1788, he was buried on his estate near Island Creek, in Granville County. Penn was re-interred in [[Guilford Courthouse National Military Park]] in 1894, alongside fellow congressional delegate, Hooper.

==Legacy==
The naval ship [[USS John Penn (APA-23)|USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Penn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] was named in his honor.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://ibiblio.net/hyperwar/USN/ships/dafs/APA/apa23.html USS John Penn (AP-51/APA-23), Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Naval History Division, Washington]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

An historical highway marker honoring Penn was the first one erected by the State of North Carolina (January 10, 1936)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.ncmarkers.com/Markers.aspx?sp=map&amp;amp;sv=G-1 North Carolina Highway Historical Marker Program]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
