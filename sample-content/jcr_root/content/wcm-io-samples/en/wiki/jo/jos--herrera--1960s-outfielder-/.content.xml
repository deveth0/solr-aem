&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;José Concepción Herrera Ontiveros&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [er-REH-rah] (born April 8, 1942 in [[Anzoátegui State|San Lorenzo, Anzoátegui State]], [[Venezuela]]) is a former [[outfielder]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played for the [[Houston Astros]] (1967–1968) and [[Montreal Expos]] (1969–1970). He batted and threw [[right-handed]].

Herrera was signed by the Houston Colt .45s as an amateur [[free agent]] and made his debut with the team after it became the Astros. Regarded as an emotional leader in the dugout, Herrera was a classic backup outfielder and got every chance he had in the field and as a [[pinch hitter]] as well.

In a four-season career, Herrera posted a .264 [[batting average]] with two [[home run]]s, 20 [[Run batted in|RBI]], 16 [[Run (baseball)|runs]], 522 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]], and 10 [[Double (baseball)|doubles]] in 80 [[games played]].
