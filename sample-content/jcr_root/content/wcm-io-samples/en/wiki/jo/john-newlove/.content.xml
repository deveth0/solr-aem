&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Newlove&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (June 13, 1938 [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] &amp;amp;ndash; December 23, 2003 [[Ottawa]]) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[poet]] who was considered to be one of the dominant voices of prairie poetry, though he lived most of his adult life in [[British Columbia]] and [[Ontario]].

==Life==
He lived in a variety of small [[Saskatchewan]] towns, in particular [[Kamsack, Saskatchewan|Kamsack]]. He attended the University of Saskatchewan for a year, worked briefly as a social worker, a teacher and at a radio station before embarking on a cross-Canada trip which eventually landed him in [[Vancouver]].

He came to prominence in the 1960s as various collections of his poetry were published to critical acclaim. He left Vancouver in May 1967 and took his family to [[Deep Springs College]] in [[California]] where composer friend [[Barney Childs]] was a professor. After several more moves, he and his family ended up in [[Toronto]] by 1970 where he worked as senior editor for [[McClelland and Stewart]]. It was during this period that he won the 1972 [[Governor General&amp;apos;s Award]] for &amp;quot;Lies.&amp;quot;

Various writer-in-residence stints followed his 1974 departure from McCelland and Stewart, including at [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]] in Montreal, the [[University of Toronto]] and  [[University of Western Ontario]] in [[London, Ontario|London]]. He lived for several years in Regina in the early 1980s where he served as writer-in-residence at the public library, then in [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]], British Columbia, where he taught at [[David Thompson University]]. Finally, he lived from 1986 in [[Ottawa]] where he would spend the rest of his life.

His 1986 collection, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Night the Dog Smiled&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was short-listed for that year&amp;apos;s English language poetry Governor General&amp;apos;s Award, and he won the 1984 Saskatchewan Writers&amp;apos; Guild Founders Award.

Newlove suffered a stroke in 2001 and died in 2003.

Newlove was the subject of two documentaries: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;New Canadian Writers: John Newlove&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1971) which was broadcast on [[TVOntario|TVO]], and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;What to Make of It All? The Life and Poetry of John Newlove&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2006) which was broadcast on [[Bravo!]] in 2007.
