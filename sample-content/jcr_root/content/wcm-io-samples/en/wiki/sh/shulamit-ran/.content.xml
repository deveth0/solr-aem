        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shulamit Ran&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-he|שולמית רן}}; born October 21, 1949 in [[Tel Aviv, Israel]]) is an Israeli-American composer. She moved from Israel to [[New York City|New York]] at 14, as a scholarship student at the [[Mannes College of Music]]. Her &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Symphony&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1990) won her the [[Pulitzer Prize]]. In this regard, she was the second woman to win the Pulitzer Prize in Music, the first being [[Ellen Taaffe Zwilich]] in 1983.

Shulamit Ran is a longtime faculty member of the [[University of Chicago]] and has served as composer-in-residence with both the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Chicago Lyric Opera]]. More recently she wrote a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Violin Concerto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2003) for the Israeli violinist [[Ittai Shapira]].

Ran studied with [[Ralph Shapey]] and dedicated her &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Symphony&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to him.

Many critics have commented{{Weasel-inline|date=August 2011}} on the combination of raw power and classical structure in Ran&amp;apos;s work. Ran has written that she considers classical-era composer [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] her &amp;quot;compositional idol,&amp;quot; and her work combines a taste for rigorous structural logic with a unique brand of &amp;quot;free [[atonality]].&amp;quot;{{Citequote|date=August 2011}}

Her students include [[C. P. First]].
