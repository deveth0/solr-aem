{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shimabara&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|島原市|Shimabara-shi}} is a [[cities of Japan|city]] located on the north-eastern tip of the [[Shimabara Peninsula]], facing [[Ariake Bay]] in the east and [[Mount Unzen]] (including [[Fugendake]]) in the west, in [[Nagasaki Prefecture]], [[Kyūshū]], [[Japan]].

==History==
Shimabara is a [[Shimabara Castle|castle town]], and was the capital of [[Shimabara Domain]] during the [[Edo period]]. It was the site of considerable foreign trade and missionary activity during the late [[Muromachi period]], and in the early Edo period, a large percentage of the population were &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Kirishitan]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Due to misgovernment, high taxes and persecution of Christianity, the population rose in the [[Shimabara Rebellion]] of 1637, which was suppressed with extreme severity by the [[Tokugawa Bakufu]]. Shimabara was ruled by a branch of the [[Matsudaira clan]] from 1668-1774 and from 1774-1871.

Modern Shimabara city was founded on April 1, 1940 by the merger of former Shimabara Town with several surrounding villages.

On January 1, 2006 the town of [[Ariake, Nagasaki|Ariake]], from [[Minamitakaki District, Nagasaki|Minamitakaki District]], was merged into Shimabara.

Throughout its history, Shimabara has been dominated by the seismic activity of Mount Unzen. A major [[volcanic eruption]] in 1792 resulted in a [[tsunami]] which destroyed most of the town, and killed over 15,000 people in one of Japan&amp;apos;s worst volcanic disasters. In more recent history, major eruptions in 1990-1991 resulted in [[pyroclastic flow]]s, which killed 43 people and forced the temporary evacuation of hundreds of others. The 5th International Conference of Cities on Volcanoes was held in Shimabara November 19&amp;amp;ndash;23, 2007.

==Economy==
Shimabara is a popular tourist destination, due to its historical associations, location in [[Unzen-Amakusa National Park]], and numerous &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[onsen]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The most popular tourist destination within the urban area is [[Shimabara Castle]] and the nearby “&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Samurai&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Street”. The city has so much natural spring water, both hot and cold, that it runs through the streets. One picturesque spot, “Carp Street”, has colorful &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[koi]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; swimming in the canals.

Principal agricultural products include [[mandarin orange]]s, [[tea]], and [[tobacco]].
