Internationally today he is especially noted for his work in the &amp;quot;[[mail art]]&amp;quot; genre, of which he was a pioneer.

She names Shimamoto as among the most daring experimentalists on the international art scene:

::&amp;quot;Perhaps driven by the exhilarating mixture of relief, freedom and despair that followed the end of World War II, artists around the world had been experimenting with newly physical, sometimes violent, cathartic ways of making paintings and sculptures. Others were also staging what they called events, or actions or performances that sometimes were as destructive as they were creative....

::&amp;quot;Some of these artists were doubtlessly influenced by Pollock&amp;apos;s example... But the same year brought independent experiments: [[Lucio Fontana]], for example, was in Argentina (or Italy), making images by repeatedly puncturing or slashing painted canvases with knives. And in Japan, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shozo Shimamoto&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was symbolically penetrating the sacrosanct picture plane of painting by throwing himself through several layers of rice paper, leaving traces of the event -- the hole surrounded by jagged shards of paper -- as the work of art.&amp;quot;
