&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shabbir Banoobhai&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 23 October 1949) is a [[South Africa]]n poet.

==Biography==

He was born in [[Durban]] and, after school wanted to study at University. The costs were prohibitive, and instead he studied to become a teacher at Springfield College. He was elected President of the Student&amp;apos;s Representative Council in 1970, and became assistant editor of the College newspaper, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aspect&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was occasionally banned for its protests against the [[apartheid]] state.

At college, he met [[Fatima Meer]], who, after finding out he wrote poetry, suggested he meet with the prominent poet [[Douglas Livingstone (poet)|Douglas Livingstone]].

While still at college, he successfully studied for a Bachelor of Commerce Degree through Unisa, the correspondence university, and after a short stint of teaching, he began work as an accountant.

In his own words, his work aims &amp;quot;to promote a vision of a more humane society â€“ a society that not only respects all its members as human beings but which considers them as spiritual beings and essentially divine&amp;quot;.
