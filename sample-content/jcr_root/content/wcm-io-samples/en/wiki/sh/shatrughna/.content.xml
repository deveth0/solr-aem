{{IndicText}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shatrughna&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Sanskrit]]: शत्रुघ्न &amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{IAST|Śatrughna}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Indonesia language|Indonesian]]: Satrugna, [[Thai language|Thai]]: พระสัตรุด, [[Burmese language|Burmese]]: Tharugana, [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: சத்துருகனன், [[Malay language|Malay]]: Citradan) was the youngest brother of Lord [[Rama]] in the [[Hindu]] epic &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ramayana]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; . He is the twin brother of [[Lakshmana]].

==Birth and family==
Shatrughna was born to the virtuous king of [[Ayodhya]], [[Dasaratha]], and his third wife, Queen [[Sumitra]]. Dasharatha&amp;apos;s other two wives, [[Kaushalya]] and [[Kaikeyi]], had sons as well. Kaushalya had [[Rama]] and Kaikeyi had [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharat]] who were Shatrughna&amp;apos;s half-brothers. Shatrughna also had a blood-brother called [[Lakshmana]]. Shatrughna&amp;apos;s name means &amp;quot;destroyer of enemies&amp;quot;. Shatrughna was married to [[Shrutakirti|Shrutakeerti]], the daughter of King [[Kushadhwaja]] and his wife. Shrutakeerti was the cousin of [[Sita]], daughter of King [[Janaka]]. He is supposed to be the reincarnation of Vishnu&amp;apos;s sacred conch.Shatrughna has two sons-Chitraketu and Subahu.

==Rama&amp;apos;s exile==
[[Image:Dasharatha four sons.jpg|thumb|left|Bharata and Shatrughna leave for Kaikeya, taking leave from Dasharatha, Rama and Lakshmana|200px]]
When Rama is exiled, Shatrughna drags Kaikeyī&amp;apos;s old nurse [[Manthara|Mantharā]] (who was responsible for poisoning the queen&amp;apos;s mind against Rāma) and makes an attack to kill her, but he is restrained by [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] who feels that Rāma would not approve.

Bharata goes to Rama and asks him to come back to Ayodhya but Rama refuses. Bharata rules Ayodhya from Nandigramam and is an excellent leader, often referred to as the avatar of dharma. Though Bharata was the king designate of Ayodhya during Rama&amp;apos;s exile, it was Shatrughna who took care of the administration of the whole kingdom, during Rama&amp;apos;s absence. Shatrughna also was the only solace for the three Queen mothers during the absence of Rama, Lakshman and Bharata from Ayodhya.

==The slaying of Lavanasura==

Although he plays a relatively minor role in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ramayana|Rāmāyaṇa]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Shatrughna is important to the main story and goal of the epic. His chief exploit is the killing of [[Lavanasura]] the demon King of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], who was a nephew of [[Ravana]] the King of [[Lanka]] slain by Rama.

Lavanasura was the son of Madhu, the pious demon-king after whom the city of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] was named. Madhu&amp;apos;s wife and Lavanusara&amp;apos;s mother was Kumbhini, a sister of [[Ravana]]. Lavanasura was the holder of the divine &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Trishula&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Trident) of Lord [[Shiva]], and nobody was able to kill him or prevent him from committing sinful activities.

Shatrughna begged Rama and his elder brothers to allow him the opportunity to serve them by killing Lavnasura. Shatrughna killed the great demon with an arrow imbibed with the power of [[Vishnu]].

==Retirement==

After Rama, the seventh [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] completes 10,000 years of perfectly pious rule upon earth, he walks into the river &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sarayu]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to return to his true and eternal [[Mahavishnu]] form. [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] and Shatrughna follow him into the river, and merge into [[Mahavishnu]].
