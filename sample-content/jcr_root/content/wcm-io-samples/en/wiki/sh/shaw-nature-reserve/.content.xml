&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shaw Nature Reserve&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, formerly known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shaw Arboretum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a {{convert|2,400|acre|km2}} private [[nature reserve]] located in [[Gray Summit, Missouri]], that is run by the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]] as an extension.

The area was opened in 1925 when pollution from coal smoke in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] threatened the garden&amp;apos;s live plant collection, especially the [[orchid]] collection. The orchids were moved in 1926, but the pollution in St. Louis decreased with waning use of coal for heat, making it unnecessary to move the rest of the live plant collection.  It is currently dedicated to environmental education, to the maintenance and restoration of the region&amp;apos;s native flora and fauna, and to public enjoyment of the natural world.

The nature reserve has several historic homes (including the Joseph H. Bascom House), a large [[prairie]], and a large wetland blind from which [[heron]]s can be observed. Over 14 miles (23 km) of [[hiking]] trails run through the reserve.  In addition, wheelchair-accessible trails and [[scenic route]]s run through the reserve.

Shaw Nature Reserve is open year round from 7a.m. till sunset.  Visitor Center hours are 8 to 4:30 on weekdays and 9 to 5 on weekends. Shaw Nature Reserve is open to hikers every day, but the Visitor Center is closed on some major holidays.  No pets are allowed on the grounds.  No reservations are required except in the case of an [[guided tour|organized tour]] and for those wishing to participate in an education program.
