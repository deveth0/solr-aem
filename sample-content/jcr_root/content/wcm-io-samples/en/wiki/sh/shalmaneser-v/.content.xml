        text="&lt;p&gt;[[File:Shalmaneser V.jpg|thumb|200px|Shalmaneser V from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Guillaume Rouillé|Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shalmaneser V&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{lang|akk|Šulmanu-ašarid}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; {{Hebrew name|שַׁלְמַנְאֶסֶר|Shalman&amp;apos;eser|Šalmanʼéser}}; {{lang-el|Σαλαμανασσαρ}} &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Salamanassar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; {{lang-la|Salmanasar}}) was [[king of Assyria]] from 727 to 722 BC. He first appears as governor of [[Zimirra]] in [[Phoenicia]] in the reign of his father, [[Tiglath-Pileser III]].

On the death of Tiglath-Pileser, he succeeded to the throne of [[Assyria]] on the 25th day of Tebet 727 BC, and changed his original name of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ululayu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to &amp;quot;Shalmaneser&amp;quot;. While it has been suggested that he continued to use &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ululayu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for his throne name as king of [[Babylonia]], this has not been found in any authentic official sources.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;G. Frame, Babylonia 689-627 B.C., p. 303-304.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The revolt of [[Samaria]] ([[Israel]]) took place during his reign, and while he was besieging the rebel city, he died on the 12th of Tebet 722 BC and the crown was seized by his brother [[Sargon II]]. According to the Bible, King of Israel [[Hoshea]] was captured in the 9th year of his reign after conspiring against Shalmaneser V by sending messages to [[So (Pharaoh)|So]], king of Egypt.

The name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shalmaneser&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is used for him in the [[Bible]], which attributes to him and his father the deportation of the &amp;quot;[[Ten Lost Tribes]]&amp;quot; of Israel. In the 17th and 18th chapters of [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] he is described as the conqueror of [[Samaria]] and as sending its inhabitants into exile. In the [[book of Tobit]], chapter 1, the exiled Tobit is shown finding favor in Shalmaneser&amp;apos;s court, only to lose influence under [[Sennacherib]].
