The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shanghai clique&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shanghai faction&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the name given to an informal group of officials in the [[Communist Party of China]], especially those who serve in the central government of the People&amp;apos;s Republic of China or the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]], who rose to prominence in connection to the Shanghai municipal administration under former CPC General secretary, President [[Jiang Zemin]]. It also includes other former subordinates of Jiang.

This popular phrase was used somewhat pejoratively to describe Jiang&amp;apos;s efforts to promote people who previously worked, or were associated with, his administration in Shanghai.

==Membership==
Important people who have been identified as belonging to the clique include incumbent [[Politburo Standing Committee|standing members]] of the powerful [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Central Committee]].

*[[Jiang Zemin]] (江泽民)
*[[Wu Bangguo]] (吴邦国)
*[[Jia Qinglin]] (贾庆林)
*[[Zeng Qinghong]] (曾庆红)
*[[Wu Guanzheng]] (吴官正)
*[[Li Changchun]] (李长春)
*[[Liu Qi (Communist)|Liu Qi]] (刘琪)
*[[Zeng Peiyan]] (曾培炎)
*[[Zhang Dejiang]] (张德江)
*[[Zhou Yongkang]] (周永康)
*[[Hui Liangyu]] (回良玉)
*[[Hua Jianmin]] (华建敏)
*[[Chen Zhili]] (陈至立)
*[[Chen Liangyu]] (陈良宇), expelled from Communist Party due to scandal
Before his death, [[Huang Ju]] (黄菊) was also a key member of the clique.

[[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|CPC General secretary]], [[President of the People&amp;apos;s Republic of China|President]] [[Hu Jintao]] and [[Premier of the People&amp;apos;s Republic of China|Premier]] [[Wen Jiabao]] are not members of the clique.

Upon Jiang&amp;apos;s retirement in 2004, it is widely believed that he stuffed the cabinet with all his men, and is said to be making it difficult for Hu and Wen to carry out their own policies. The best evidence of this is in the recently concluded 5th [[Plenary meeting|Plenary Meeting]] of [[16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China]], when Hu&amp;apos;s efforts to reshuffle the [[politburo]] was blocked by members of the Shanghai Clique. Wen&amp;apos;s [[macro-economics|macro-economic]] measures aimed at slowing down infrastructure growth and nationwide overheating in the property sector received great resistance from alleged members of this clique.

However, as Jiang had retired from all of his positions at the 4th Plenary Meeting of 16th [[National Congress]] of the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]], Hu became the legitimate [[paramount leader]] of the CPC. There are signs of important members of the Shanghai Clique defecting to Hu&amp;apos;s camp, thereby strengthening Hu&amp;apos;s position. In addition, in a bold move in September 2006, Hu acted to purge prominent rival [[Chen Liangyu]], former [[Mayor of Shanghai]], for alleged corruption, thus strengthening his position both within the [[Communist Party of China|party]] and in China.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/5376858.stm BBC] article &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Top China leader fired for graft&amp;apos;&amp;apos; published 25 September 2006&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
