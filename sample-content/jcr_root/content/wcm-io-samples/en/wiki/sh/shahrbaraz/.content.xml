&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shahrbaraz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shahrwaraz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-fa|شهربراز}}) (died June 9, 630) was a general, with the rank of [[Eran Spahbod]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Commander of the Army of Iran&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) under [[Khosrau II]] (590&amp;amp;ndash;628).  His name was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Farrokhan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and Shahrbaraz was his title. It means &amp;quot;the Boar of the Empire&amp;quot;, attesting to his dexterity in military command and his warlike persona, as the boar was the animal associated with the Zoroastrian [[Yazata|Izad]] [[Vahram]], the epitome of victory.

Shahrbaraz took [[Damascus]] and [[Jerusalem]] from the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 613 and 614 respectively, and the [[True Cross|Holy Cross]] was carried away in triumph.  However, during [[Heraclius]]&amp;apos; (610&amp;amp;ndash;641) [[Heraclius&amp;apos; campaign of 622|campaign in the Persian Empire]] in the 620s, mutual suspicion arose between Khosrau II and Shahrbaraz.  Byzantine agents showed Shahrbaraz letters indicating that Khosrau II was planning the general&amp;apos;s execution.  This kept one of the main Persian armies and its best general neutral during this crucial period, speeding the end of the war and the [[Battle of Nineveh (627)|Byzantine victory]].

Following the Persian surrender, Shahrbaraz was heavily involved in the intrigues of the [[Sassanian]] court.  On April 27, 630, he killed [[Ardashir III of Persia]] (628&amp;amp;ndash;630) and became the twenty-fifth ruler of the Sassanian Empire.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Parvaneh Pourshariati, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Decline and Fall of the Sasanian Empire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (I.B.Tauris, 2008), 181, 183.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  He made peace with Heraclius and returned to him a relic that was accepted as the [[True Cross]]. In April 630 he failed to deal with the invasion of [[Armenia]] by a [[Khazar]]-[[Gokturk]] force under [[Chorpan Tarkhan]]. On June 9, 630 Shahrbaraz was slain, and [[Purandokht]] succeeded him.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Parvaneh Pourshariati, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Decline and Fall of the Sasanian Empire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 184.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
