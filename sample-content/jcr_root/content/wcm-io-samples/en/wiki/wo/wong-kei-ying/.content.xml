&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wong Kei-ying&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ca. 1815 – 1886), also known as Wong Leung-ying, was a Chinese martial artist and physician who lived during the late [[Qing Dynasty]]. He was one of the [[Ten Tigers of Canton]]. His son [[Wong Fei-hung]] inherited his martial arts and medical skills and was also commonly featured as a folk hero in Chinese popular culture.

==Biography==
Wong was born in the village of Xiqiao, [[Nanhai District|Nanhai]], [[Guangdong]]. His date of birth is not specified. His son [[Wong Fei-hung]] lived from 1847 to 1924, so it is possible that he was born in the 1810s or 1820s, but there is no documentation of his birth.

As a young man, Wong performed as a street artist, using martial arts and acrobatics. During one of these performances in Guangdong, he was noticed by Luk Ah-choi, a practitioner of [[Hung Ga]] style who is known as the first and best disciple of [[Jee Sin Sim See]] and as a classmate of [[Hung Hei-gun]], for whom Hung Gar is named. Based on the young acrobat&amp;apos;s talent, Luk accepted Wong as a student.

A different story, which reflects the sense of history and lineage in Hung Ga, says that Luk Ah-choi learned Taming the Tiger Fist, a southern [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolin]] form, from Abbot Chan, who was staying in the Hoi-tong Monastery in Guangdong. Luk passed it on to Wong Tai, who lived in Saichiu, who passed it on to his son Wong Kei-ying.

Wong spent ten years training and mastering all of Luk&amp;apos;s skills, including Single Hard Fist, Double Hard Fist, Taming the Tiger Fist, Mother and Son [[Butterfly sword|Butterfly Knives]], Angry Tiger Fist, Fifth Brother Eight Trigram Pole, Flying Hook, and Black Tiger Fist. Once this training was complete, Wong became a martial arts instructor and member of the [[Black Flag Army]]. His wages were so low that he had to sell herbal medicine to support his family. He had a herbal medicine dispensary on Jingyan Street in Guangdong.

Wong became so famous that he was named one of the [[Ten Tigers of Canton]], the top ten martial arts masters in Guangdong (Canton) in the late [[Qing Dynasty]]. Wong&amp;apos;s skills were inherited by his son [[Wong Fei-hung]].

==Cultural references==
In the many films about [[Wong Fei-hung]], especially the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Once Upon a Time in China]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; series, Wong Kei-ying appears as a supporting character with little screen time. However the 1993 film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Iron Monkey (1993 film)|Iron Monkey]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a fictional depiction of the relationship between Wong Kei-ying and a ten-year-old Wong Fei-hung. It hints at how the younger Wong is shaped by the example of his father.
