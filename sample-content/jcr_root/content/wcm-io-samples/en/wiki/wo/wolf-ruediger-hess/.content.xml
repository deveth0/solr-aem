        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wolf Rüdiger Hess&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Heß&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in German; 18 November 1937&amp;amp;nbsp;– 24 October 2001) was the son of [[Rudolf Hess]]. He was also an outspoken critic of the investigation into his father&amp;apos;s death, which he believed was a cover-up. He maintained that the British [[Secret Intelligence Service|Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)]] had murdered his father in order to prevent his [[parole]]&amp;amp;mdash;which he believed to be imminent&amp;amp;mdash;because the British government were afraid that his father, if allowed to speak freely, would reveal embarrassing information about British actions during [[World War II]]. In 2007, however, documents demonstrating British support for Hess&amp;apos; release on humanitarian grounds and their campaign against steadfast [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] opposition to his release were published.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7017191.stm British Sympathy for Jailed Nazi on the BBC]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Hess was deeply embittered by his father&amp;apos;s long [[Solitary confinement|solitary imprisonment]].

Hess wrote three books: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;My Father Rudolf Hess&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1986), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Who Murdered My Father, Rudolf Hess?&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1989) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rudolf Heß: Ich bereue nichts&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rudolf Hess: I do not repent anything&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (1994/1998).

Hess was head of the &amp;quot;Rudolf-Heß-Gesellschaft e.V.&amp;quot; until his death. He left behind a widow and three children.
