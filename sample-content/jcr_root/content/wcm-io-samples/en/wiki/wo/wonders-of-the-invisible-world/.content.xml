&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wonders of the Invisible World&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a book that was published in 1693 by [[Cotton Mather]], Mather was born in 1663. After graduating from [[Harvard College]], he followed in his father&amp;apos;s footsteps to become a pastor of the [[Second Church of Boston]]. He continued in this role from 1685 until his death in 1728.&amp;lt;ref name=norton/&amp;gt;{{rp|307}} His book contained information about the [[Salem Witch Trials]], which had taken place in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. [[Robert Calef]] published a response to Mather&amp;apos;s book in 1700.

Its discussion of Swedish witch trials may have come from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Saducismus Triumphatus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Joseph Glanvill]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ankarloo, Bengt and Henningsen, Gustav (editors) Early Modern European Witchcraft: Centres and Peripheries (1990). Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 431-3.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Summary==
While narrator and preacher of the Second Church of Boston, he began with an explanation of how the people of God were living in the devil&amp;apos;s territories. He discussed the devil&amp;apos;s plan to overturn the plantation and churches with the help of witches.

&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;...An army of devils is horribly broke in upon the place which is the center, and after a sort, the first-born of our English settlements...&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref name=norton&amp;gt;{{cite book |editor-first1=Nina |editor-last1=Baym, |editor-first2=Wayne |editor-last2=Franklin |editor-first3=Philip F. |editor-last3=Gura |editor-first4=Arnold |editor-last4=Krupat |editor-first5=Robert S. |editor-last5=Levine|title=The Norton Anthology: American Literature |volume=A. |edition =7 |p=309 |ISBN=0393929930}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Mather prefaced the trials, by saying he would recount the trials as a historian.  One of the trials included was Martha Carrier&amp;apos;s, who was &amp;quot;[t]he person of whom the confessions of the witches, and of her own children among the rest, agreed that the devil had promised her she should be Queen of the Hebrews.&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=norton/&amp;gt;{{rp|313}} Mather gave testimonies against Martha Carrier, all of which presumed her to be guilty.

==Analysis==

===Point of view===
Mather presented himself as an unbiased informer to the reader.&amp;lt;ref name=norton/&amp;gt;{{rp|310}} He received his information from court records.  He did not present defenses against the testimonies given.

===Language===
Matherâ€™s background as a minister&amp;lt;ref name=norton/&amp;gt;{{rp|307}} showed in his references to religion.  Mather went into details on the traditional religious view of the Devil and witchcraft.&amp;lt;ref name=norton/&amp;gt;{{rp|308}}

Puritan colonists feared the perceived witches among them, &amp;quot;and the houses of the good people are filled with the doleful shrieks of their children and servants, tormented by invisible hands.&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=norton/&amp;gt;{{rp|309}}
