        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;World Fellowship of Buddhists&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (WFB) is an international [[Buddhist]] organization. It was founded in 1950 in [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]] by representatives from 27 nations. Although [[Theravada]] Buddhists are most influential in the organization, (its headquarters are in [[Thailand]] and all of its presidents have been from Sri Lanka or southeast Asia), members of all Buddhist schools are active in the WFB. It now has regional centers in 35 countries, including India, the United States, Australia, and several nations of Africa and Europe, in addition to traditional Buddhist countries.

The aims and objectives of the World Fellowship of Buddhists are:
#To promote among the members strict observance and practice of the teachings of the Buddha
#To secure unity, solidarity, and brotherhood amongst Buddhists
#To propagate the sublime doctrine of the Buddha
#To organize and carry on activities in the field of social, educational, cultural and other humanitarian services
#To work for happiness, harmony and peace on earth and to collaborate with other organizations working for the same ends.

The current president is [[Phan Wannamethee]] of Thailand serving since 1999, while Venerable [[Hsing Yun]] of the [[Republic of China]] serves as honorary president.
