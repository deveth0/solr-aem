The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wolf Prize&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an international [[List of prizes, medals, and awards|award]] granted in [[Israel]], that has been presented most years since 1978 to living scientists and artists for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;achievements in the interest of mankind and friendly relations among peoples ... irrespective of nationality, race, colour, religion, sex or political views.&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

==Prizes==

The prize is awarded in [[Israel]] by the [[Wolf Foundation]], founded by [[Ricardo Wolf|Dr. Ricardo Wolf]], a German-born inventor and former [[Cuba]]n ambassador to Israel. It is awarded in six fields: [[Wolf Prize in Agriculture|Agriculture]], [[Wolf Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]], [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics|Mathematics]], [[Wolf Prize in Medicine|Medicine]], [[Wolf Prize in Physics|Physics]], and an [[Wolf Prize in Arts|Arts]] prize that rotates between architecture, music, painting, and sculpture. Each prize consists of a diploma and US$100,000. The prize is described by the Foundation as being &amp;quot;awarded annually&amp;quot;, but is not in fact awarded every year: only six prizes were awarded in the 2000s (decade) in most fields, and four in Physics.

==Prestige==

The Wolf Prizes in physics and chemistry are often considered the most prestigious awards in those fields after the Nobel Prize.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/18884 Physicsworld.com: Wolf prize goes to particle theorists]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=gongs_away/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Basolo, F: &amp;quot;From Coello to Inorganic Chemistry: A Lifetime of Reactions&amp;quot;, page 65, Springer, 2002&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The prize in physics has gained a reputation for identifying future winners of the Nobel Prize – from the 26 prizes awarded between 1978 and 2010, fourteen winners have gone on to win the Nobel Prize, five of those in the following year.&amp;lt;ref name=gongs_away/&amp;gt;

In medicine, the prize is probably the third most prestigious, after the Nobel Prize and the [[Lasker Award]]. Until the establishment of the [[Abel Prize]], the Wolf Prize was probably the closest equivalent of a &amp;quot;Nobel Prize in Mathematics&amp;quot;, since the more prestigious [[Fields Medal]] was only awarded every four years to mathematicians under forty years old. The Prize in Agriculture has likewise been equated to a &amp;quot;Nobel Prize in Agriculture&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;National Research
Council: &amp;quot;National Research Initiative: A Vital Competitive Grants Program in Food, Fiber and Natural-resources Research&amp;quot;, page 155, National Academies Press, 2000&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;For past Wolf Prize laureates, see the separate lists for [[Wolf Prize in Agriculture|Agriculture]], [[Wolf Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]], [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics|Mathematics]], [[Wolf Prize in Medicine|Medicine]], [[Wolf Prize in Physics|Physics]] and [[Wolf Prize in Arts|Arts]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
