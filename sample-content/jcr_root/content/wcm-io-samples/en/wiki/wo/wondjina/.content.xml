In [[Aboriginal mythology]], the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wondjina&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wandjina&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) were [[cloud]] and [[rain]] spirits who, during the [[Dream time]], created or influenced the landscape and its inhabitants.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;This site contains some examples of Wondjina folklore:
[http://www.australianstamp.com/Coin-web/feature/history/abdream.htm www. australianstamp. com/Coin-web/feature/history/abdream.htm]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  When they found the place they would die, they painted their images on [[cave]] walls and entered a nearby waterhole.  The Wondjina style dates from around 3800 [[Before Present|B.P.]], following the end of a millennium long drought that gave way to a wetter climate characterised by regular monsoons.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;McGowan H, Marx S, Moss P, Hammond A. Evidence of ENSO mega-drought triggered collapse of prehistory Aboriginal society in northwest Australia. GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 39, L22702, 5 PP., 2012 doi:10.1029/2012GL053916 [http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2012GL053916.shtml]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Today, certain Aboriginal people of the [[Mowanjum Community|Mowanjum]] tribes repaint the images to ensure the continuity of the Wondjina&amp;apos;s presence.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

Annual repainting in December or January also ensures the arrival of the monsoon rains, according to [[Mowanjum Community|Mowanjum]] belief.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

}} p.12&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Repainting has occurred so often that at one site the paint is over 40 layers deep.  The painting style evolves during this process: the figures of recent years are stockier and some now possess eyelashes.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

The Wondjina paintings have common colors of black, red and yellow on a white background.  They appear alone or in groups, vertically or horizontally depending on the dimensions of the rock, and can be depicted with figures and objects like the [[Rainbow Serpent]] or [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]].  Common composition is with large upper bodies and heads that show eyes and nose, but typically no mouth.  Two explanations have been given for this: they are so powerful they do not require speech&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and if they had mouths, the rain would never cease.  Around the heads of Wondjina are lines or blocks of color, depicting lightning, clouds or rain.  The Wondjina can punish those who break the law with floods, lightning and cyclones.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

In 2007, [[graffiti]] depictions of Wandjina appeared in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]].  Styles ranged from stencil-work to a spray painted Wondjina driving a pink car.  Using [[flickr]] and [[blogs]], several people engaged in &amp;apos;Wondjina watching&amp;apos;, documenting the Wondjina graffiti they found.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;
