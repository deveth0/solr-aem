The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Worshipful Company of Actuaries&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]] of the [[City of London]]. The Company was founded and became a Livery Company in 1979, on the same day as the [[Insurers&amp;apos; Company]]. The Company supports the actuarial profession by awarding scholarships in the field.

The Actuaries&amp;apos; Company ranks ninety-first in the [[order of precedence]] for Livery Companies.

Like the medieval Liveries of the City of London, the company plays a full role in the governance of the City, including the election and support of the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs.

Most importantly, through its Charitable Trust, it gives help and support to those who are less fortunate, with an emphasis on making a difference in improving education, particularly in the area of mathematics.
