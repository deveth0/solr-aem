        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]] of the [[City of London]], [[England]]. An organisation of Wheelwrights and [[Coachmakers&amp;apos; and Coach Harness Makers&amp;apos; Company|Coachmakers]] petitioned for incorporation in 1630. The petition was granted forty years later, in 1670, when a [[Royal Charter]] was granted to the Wheelwrights. (The Coachmakers were separately incorporated in 1677.) The Wheelwrights&amp;apos; Company was granted the status of a Livery Company in 1763. Over the years, wheel making has changed from being made by craftsmen to being made by machines. Thus, the Company is no longer a trade association for wheelwrights. Instead, it functions as a charitable body.

The Wheelwrights&amp;apos; Company ranks sixty-eighth in the [[order of precedence]] for Livery Companies. Its motto is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;God Grant Unity&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
