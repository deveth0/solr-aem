&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Woman on top&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also called the, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;cowboy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;cowgirl&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;riding&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; position, is a group of [[sex position]]s in which the man lies on his back or sits, the woman straddles him and they face each other, and the [[vagina]] or [[anus]] of the receiving partner is aligned with the [[phallus]] of the inserting partner to achieve [[sexual penetration|penetration]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;discovery&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://healthguide.howstuffworks.com/sexual-positions-dictionary2.htm &amp;quot;Discovery Health Sexual Positions&amp;quot;]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;healthguide.howstuffworks.com&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The cowgirl name derives from the image of the receiving partner &amp;quot;riding&amp;quot; the partner as a [[cowboy]] rides a bucking horse. It is one of a number of receptive-partner-superior sexual positions, another being the [[#Reverse cowgirl|reverse cowgirl]] position. It is fairly simple to achieve and maintain and pleasures both partners. This position is also used as a precursor to the [[lateral coital position]] described by [[Masters and Johnson]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

This position is commonly cited as one of the more popular sex positions.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.the-clitoris.com/f_html/sexual_positions_1.htm &amp;quot;Positions for Sexual Intercourse&amp;quot;]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the-clitoris.com&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Reverse cowgirl==
[[Image:Carracci05.jpg|thumb|Reverse cowgirl position]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
In reverse cowgirl variation, also known as crab sex, the woman faces away from the man. She can either be in a [[kneeling]] or [[squatting position|squatting]] position and can have her torso upright, or she can have it aligned with the inserting man&amp;apos;s body. The woman has greater control over the extent and duration of the penetration.

This position can be used for vaginal or anal sex, with penetration achieved by a [[penis]] or a [[strap-on dildo]].

It serves to stimulate the most sensitive parts of the man&amp;apos;s penis as a result of the way it is forced to bend while at the same time rubbing on the female G-spot and [[clitoris]] simultaneously.

This position is widely depicted in male-female [[pornography]], because it enables the viewer to have a full frontal view of the woman, with the view of the man (except for his genitals) being of secondary consideration.

==Disabilities==
The reverse missionary position is one of a number of positions sometimes recommended for experimentation by partners in which the inserting partner has some form of disability. [[Ruth Westheimer|Dr. Ruth Westheimer]] wrote to the wife of a [[stroke]] victim that:&amp;lt;ref name = &amp;quot;Westheimer&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.ivillagehealth.com/experts/sexual/qas/0,,230550_588743,00.html  iVillage Health].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;Another area that you could explore would be a change of positions. The [[Spoons sex position|side by side position]] is sometimes helpful in these situations, as long as you make sure that the stroke victim is positioned so that the &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; side is uppermost. You could also try [[mutual masturbation]], [[oral genital stimulation]], the female superior position or the use of a [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrator]].&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

The female superior position is used a great deal in the film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Caterpillar (film)|Caterpillar]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, about a Japanese war vet whose loss of limbs has rendered this the only possible position that allows copulation with his long-suffering wife.
