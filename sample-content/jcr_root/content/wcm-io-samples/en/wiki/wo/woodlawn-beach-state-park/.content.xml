        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Woodlawn Beach State Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is located in [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], [[New York]], [[United States|U.S.]].  After a period of closure due to state budget constraints, since 2011 the park has been operated by the [[Hamburg (town), New York|Town of Hamburg]] through a ten year partnership agreement with [[New York State]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.buffalonews.com/city/article46406.ece&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.buffalonews.com/city/communities/hamburg/article876604.ece&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The &amp;quot;2010 Woodlawn Beach Sanitary Survey Report&amp;quot; completed by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation notes several potential bacteria sources which may affect the beach, including: sewage overflows, stormwater outfalls, urban runoff, contaminated stream drainage, and algae and leafy debris.  Woodlawn Beach has been identified as the third most polluted swimming beach in New York State after failing 32% of water sample tests in 2011.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.nrdc.org/water/oceans/ttw/ny.asp&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
