[[Image:Nicholas Pocock - Woolwich Dockyard.jpg|thumb|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Woolwich Dockyard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Nicholas Pocock]], 1790, [[National Maritime Museum]]]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Woolwich Dockyard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[England|English]] naval [[shipyard|dockyard]] founded by King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1512 to build his [[flagship]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Henri Grâce à Dieu]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Great Harry&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), the largest ship of its day.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;eb&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9077452 Woolwich], Encyclopædia Britannica Online Library Edition, 2010&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Like its counterpart [[Deptford Dockyard]], it was probably chosen for its position - on the south bank of the tidal [[River Thames]] conveniently close to Henry&amp;apos;s palace at [[Greenwich, London|Greenwich]].

Its facilities ultimately included two large [[dry dock]]s, a substantial basin (now used by local anglers), [[masting sheer]]s, numerous storehouses, a gatehouse and clockhouse, gun bastions, and, in later years, a large metal-working factory used to produce [[anchors]] and other iron items used in shipbuilding.

[[Engineer]] [[Samuel Bentham]] was an [[apprentice]] [[shipwright]] at the dockyard during the 1770s.

As ships grew bigger and the Thames began to silt up, the dockyard eventually closed in 1869.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/sea-and-ships/facts/ships-and-seafarers/the-royal-dockyards-of-deptford-and-woolwich|title=The Royal Dockyards of Deptford and Woolwich|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; These days all that remains are a couple of closed off docks. Less than half a [[mile]] to the south there is a [[railway station]] called [[Woolwich Dockyard railway station|Woolwich Dockyard]].
