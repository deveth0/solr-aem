        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Worshipful Company of Paviors&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]] of the [[City of London]]. The Paviors were formed at some point prior to 1276; they were responsible for the paving and maintenance of London&amp;apos;s streets. It received a [[Royal Charter]] in 1672. The Company is no longer a trade association for, and a regulator of, London&amp;apos;s road constructors, instead acting as a charitable institution; for example, it has sponsored a road making display at [[Amberley Working Museum]].

The Paviors&amp;apos; Company ranks fifty-sixth in the [[order of precedence]] for Livery Companies. Its motto is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;God Can Raise to Abraham Children of Stone&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
