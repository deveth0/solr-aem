        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Worshipful Company of Tobacco Pipe Makers and Tobacco Blenders&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]] of the [[City of London]]. The Company ranks 82nd in the [[order of precedence]] of the Companies. It does not have its own livery hall but meets instead at various halls of other Livery Companies.

The Company&amp;apos;s motto is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Producat Terra&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Latin]] for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Out of the Earth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Its church is [[St Lawrence Jewry|St. Lawrence Jewry next Guildhall]], the official Church of the Corporation of London, located on [[Gresham Street]].

==History==
The Company was first incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] granted by [[James VI and I|King James I]] in 1619, with responsibility for regulating the manufacture of clay [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)|tobacco pipe]]s. In 1643, following the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] in 1642, the Company forfeited its Charter through non-payment of its annual rent to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The Company was restored by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1663, but was declared bankrupt in 1868 after its powers of regulation over tobacco pipe makers were abolished and its income from its members had declined significantly. The Company was reincorporated as the Company of Tobacco Pipe Makers and Tobacco Blenders in 1954 by members of the Briar Pipe and Tobacco Trades, and in 1960 became a Livery Company once more.

==Modern activities==
In common with many of the other Livery Companies, the Company is no longer a [[trade association]] and is primarily concerned with raising funds for distribution to various charities through its benevolent fund, formed in 2010, as well as supporting educational institutions and providing support for members of the tobacco trade and their families.

Amongst a wide range of charitable activities, the Company sponsors an under-15s trophy at [[Arundel Castle Cricket Ground]], for which the Company&amp;apos;s funds also help to maintain coaching programmes and infrastructure, and it supports a [[Equestrianism|horse riding]] school for the disabled based in Essex.

The Master of the Company for 2012-13 is Michael C. T. Prideaux. [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lt Col]] Peter Swanson is the Clerk.

==References==
The Company&amp;apos;s history which provides the references for the information on this page was published in 1969 in [http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001L9O6YK/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;me=&amp;amp;seller= a limited edition book] of 500 copies entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A History of the Worshipful Company of Tobacco Pipe Makers and Tobacco Blenders&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, commissioned for distribution to members of the Livery Company at the time.
