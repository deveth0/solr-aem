        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Worshipful Company of Tin Plate Workers &amp;apos;&amp;apos;alias&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Wire Workers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]] of the [[City of London]]. Tin craftsmen were originally part of the [[Worshipful Company of Ironmongers|Ironmongers&amp;apos; Company]], while the wire workers, who made wire objects such as cages, animal traps and fishhooks, were part of the [[Worshipful Company of Girdlers|Girdlers&amp;apos; Company]]. The two groups combined, and were incorporated by a [[Royal Charter]] in 1670. Now, the use of tin plate and steel wire does not remain work done by craftsmen, instead being performed by machines. Thus, the Company is no longer a trade association for craftsmen. Instead, it supports the industry through grants, as it does charities.

The Tin Plate Workers&amp;apos; Company ranks sixty-seventh in the [[order of precedence]] for Livery Companies. Its motto is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Amore Sitis Uniti&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Latin for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Be United in Love&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
