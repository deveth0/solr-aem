The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Worshipful Company of Glovers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]] of the [[City of London]]. Glovers were originally classified as [[Worshipful Company of Cordwainers|Cordwainers]], but eventually separated to form their own organization in 1349. They received a [[Royal Charter]] of incorporation in 1639. The Company is now, as are most other Livery Companies, a charitable body, instead of a body that retains links to its original trade. A ceremonial link, though, is still maintained; the Company formally presents the [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|Sovereign]] with gloves upon his or her coronation.

The Company ranks sixty-second in the [[order of precedence]] of Livery Companies. The Company&amp;apos;s motto is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;True Hearts and Warm Hands&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
