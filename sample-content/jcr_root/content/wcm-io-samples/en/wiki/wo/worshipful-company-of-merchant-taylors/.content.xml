        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of the 108 [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]] of the [[City of London]].

The Company, originally known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Guild and Fraternity of St. John the Baptist in the City of London&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was first incorporated under a [[Royal Charter]] in 1327, confirmed by later charters in 1408, 1503 and 1719.

Its seat is the [[Merchant Taylors&amp;apos; Hall, London|Merchant Taylors&amp;apos; Hall]] between [[Threadneedle Street]] and [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]], a site it has occupied since 1347. The Company&amp;apos;s [[motto]] is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Concordia Parvae Res Crescunt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historian [[Sallust]] meaning &amp;apos;&amp;apos;In Harmony Small Things Grow&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==History==

The Company was at first an association of [[tailor]]s. By the end of the 17th century, its connection with the tailoring trade had virtually ceased and it became what it is today, a philanthropic and social association.  As a result it owns, supports or is associated with several schools, almhouses and other [[Charitable organization|charitable institutions]]. It owns [[Merchant Taylors&amp;apos; School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors&amp;apos; School]] in Sandy Lodge and St. John&amp;apos;s Preparatory School in Northwood, both in Hertfordshire, and is associated with [[Merchant Taylors&amp;apos; School, Crosby]], [[Merchant Taylors&amp;apos; Girls&amp;apos; School]] in Crosby, [[Wolverhampton Grammar School]], [[Foyle and Londonderry College]], [[Wallingford School]], and [[The King&amp;apos;s School, Macclesfield]]. It is also associated with [[St John&amp;apos;s College, Oxford]], founded by [[Thomas White (merchant)|Sir Thomas White]] (a Master of the Company) in 1555, and with [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]].

It donates prizes to [[St. Helen&amp;apos;s School]] in Northwood. It gives support to the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]], the [[London College of Fashion]], the Textile Conservation Centre and the [[Royal Society of Arts]]. It also supports Treloar School in Hampshire, a school and college for children with physical disabilities.

==Ranking==

Under an order issued by mayor Robert Billesden in 1484, the Company ranks in sixth or seventh place (making it one of the Great Twelve City Livery Companies) in the [[order of precedence]] of the Livery Companies, alternating with the [[Worshipful Company of Skinners|Skinners&amp;apos; Company]]. The annual switch occurs at [[Easter]]. The Merchant Taylors are normally sixth in the order of precedence in odd numbered years, and at seven in even numbered years.
