        text="&lt;p&gt;On November 19, 2003, the [[Lower Manhattan Development Corporation]] unveiled 8 finalist designs for the [[World Trade Center Memorial]]. The memorial is intended to be the focus of [[Daniel Libeskind]]&amp;apos;s [[Memory Foundations]] master plan for the redevelopment of the [[World Trade Center]] site.

The [[World Trade Center Memorial]] is to be located within the [[slurry wall]] that once framed the Twin Towers, and is also framed by a museum and cultural facilities along the periphery of the site. (Some of the finalists suggest changes to Libeskind&amp;apos;s plan, which continues to evolve as reconstruction progresses).

The eight selected finalists were mostly young, unknown designers from the [[United States]], [[France]], and [[Israel]]. They are:

* [[Votives in Suspension]] by Norman Lee and Michael Lewis - Houston TX
* [[Lower Waters]] by Bradley Campbell and Matthias Neumann - Brooklyn NY
* [[Passages of Light]] : Memorial Cloud by Gisela Baurmann, [[Sawad Brooks]] and [[Jonas Coersmeier]] - New York NY
* [[Suspending Memory]] by Joseph Karadin with Hsin-Yi Wu - New York NY
* [[Garden of Lights]] by Pierre David with Sean Corriel and Jessica Kmetovic - Paris, France
* [[Reflecting Absence]] by Michael Arad - New York NY
* [[Dual Memory]] by Brian Strawn and Karla Sierralta - Chicago IL
* [[Inversion of Light]] by Toshio Sasaki - Brooklyn NY
