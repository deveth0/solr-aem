        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wolfgang Iser&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (22 July 1926 – 24 January 2007) was a German literary scholar.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Marienberg, Saxony|Marienberg]], [[Weimar Germany|Germany]].  His parents were Paul and Else (Steinbach) Iser. He studied literature in the universities of [[Leipzig]] and [[Tübingen]] before receiving his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in English at [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] with a dissertation on the world view of [[Henry Fielding]] (1950). A year later he was appointed an instructor at Heidelberg and in 1952 an assistant lecturer at the [[University of Glasgow]], where he started to explore contemporary philosophy and literature, which deepened his interest in inter-cultural exchange. He subsequently lectured in many other parts of the world, including Asia and Israel. He was married to Lore Iser.

==Hermeneutics==
He is known for his [[Reader-response criticism|reader-response]] theory in [[literary theory]]. This theory began to evolve in 1967, while he was working in the [[University of Konstanz]], which he helped to found in the 1960s. Together with [[Hans Robert Jauss]], he is considered to be the founder of the [[Constance School]] of [[reception aesthetics]]. Reader-response theory shares many goals and insights with [[hermeneutics]]; both aim to describe the reader&amp;apos;s contact with text and the author. Iser describes the process of first reading, the subsequent development of the text into a &amp;apos;whole&amp;apos;, and how the dialogue between the reader and text takes place.  In his study of Shakespeare&amp;apos;s histories, in particular &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Iser interprets Richard&amp;apos;s continually changing legal policy as expression of the desire for self-assertion.  Here he follows [[Hans Blumenberg]], and attempts to apply his theory of modernity to Shakespeare. In this theory of modernity is self-assertion, which responds to the destruction of scholastic rationalism in the nominalist revolution (with [[William of Ockham]]).
