        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ideation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the [[creativity | creative]] process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an [[idea]] is understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Jonson, 2005, page 613&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Ideation comprises all stages of a thought cycle, from [[innovation]], to development, to actualization.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Graham and Bachmann, 2004, pg 54&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  As such, it is an essential part of the [[design process]], both in education and practice.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Broadbent, in Fowles, 1979, page 15&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Methods of innovation==

Methods of innovation include:&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Graham and Bachmann, 2004, Chapter 3&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

;Problem solution:  This is the most simple method of progress, where someone has found a problem and as a result, solves it.
;Evolutionary idea:  Evolutionary ideas derive from somewhere else, taking something that already exists and improving on it.
;Symbiotic idea:  A symbiotic method of idea creation is when multiple ideas are combined, using different elements of each to make a whole.
;Revolutionary idea:  A revolutionary idea breaks away from traditional thought and creates a brand new perspective.  For example, [[Marxism]] (an evolutionary form of [[Hegel]]ianism), or the writings of [[Copernicus]] (a development of classical Greek thought).
;Serendipitous discovery:  [[Serendipitous]] solutions are ideas which have been coincidentally developed without the intention of the inventor. For example, the discovery of [[penicillin]].
;Targeted innovation:  Creating a targeted innovation deals with a direct path of discovery.  This is often accompanied by intensive research in order to have a distinct and almost expected resolution.  For example, [[linear programming]].
;Artistic innovation:  Artistic innovation disregards the necessity for practicality and holds no constraints.
;Philosophical idea:  The philosophical idea lives in the mind of the creator and can never{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} be proven.  This type of idea however can still have vast residual effects.  For example, the idea of [[eternal recurrence]].
;Computer-assisted discovery:  This uses a computer in order to widen possibilities of research and numeric possibilities.
