&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Idu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (이두; ) is an archaic [[writing system]] that represents the [[Korean language]] using [[hanja]]. The term &amp;quot;idu&amp;quot; is used in two senses.  It may refer to various systems of representing [[Korean phonology]] through [[Chinese character]]s called [[hanja]], which were used from the early [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] to [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] periods.  In this sense it includes &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[hyangchal]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[gugyeol]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; writing, as well as the narrower sense of &amp;quot;idu&amp;quot;.  The narrower sense refers solely to the system developed in the [[Goryeo]] period (918–1392), and first referred to by name in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Jewang Ungi]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;idu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; script used [[hanja]], along with special symbols to indicate Korean verb endings and other grammatical markers that were different in Korean from Chinese. This made both the meaning and pronunciation difficult to parse, and was one reason why the system was gradually abandoned, to be replaced with [[hangul]], after the 15th century.  In this respect, it faced problems analogous to those that confronted early efforts to represent the [[Japanese language]] with [[kanji]], due to grammatical differences between these languages and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

Characters were selected for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;idu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; based on their Korean sound, their adapted Korean sound, or their meaning, and some were given a completely new sound and meaning. At the same time, 150 new Korean characters were invented, mainly for names of people and places. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Idu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; system was used mainly by members of the [[Jungin]] class.
