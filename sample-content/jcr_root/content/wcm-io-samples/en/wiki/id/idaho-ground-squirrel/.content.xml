The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Idaho ground squirrel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Urocitellus brunneus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)  is a [[species]] of the largest genus of [[ground squirrel]]s.  There are two subspecies, both in [[Idaho]]. They are also known as Idaho Spotted Ground Squirrel.

==Description==
The species has sexual dimorphism, with males being normally larger than females. Their weight ranges from 120 to 290 grams and are on average 233mm in length, though their range is 209mm to 258mm.

==Behavior==
They hibernate eight to nine months of the year.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yensen |first1=E. |last2=Sherman |first2=P.W. |year=1997 |title=Spermophilus brunneus |journal=[[Mammalian Species]] |volume=560 |publisher=[[American Society of Mammalogists]]}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Northern Idaho ground squirrel (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;U. brunneus brunneus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)==
The northern Idaho ground squirrel subspecies, hereafter referred to as NIDGS, is found in [[Valley County, Idaho|Valley]] and [[Adams County, Idaho|Adams]] counties, in about two dozen isolated [[deme]]s (population groups) thought to  occur only at an elevations between 1150–1550 meters (3775–5075&amp;amp;nbsp;feet).  Recently, demes of NIDGS were discovered at elevations up to 2290 meters (7500&amp;amp;nbsp;feet).{{citation needed|date=May 2007}}  The most recent numbers from the [[Fish and Wildlife Service]] suggest that 500 or less of these squirrels are in existence, however the recent discovery of squirrels at higher elevations may mean that there are indeed many more squirrels than we know of.  Many areas of suitable squirrel habitat remain to be surveyed by Payette National Forest and [[Idaho Department of Fish and Game]] employees.  The squirrel is currently protected by an agreement between the US Fish and Wildlife Service and private landowners, who, in exchange for federal funding, have agreed to allow the Fish and Wildlife Service to conduct conservation efforts on their land.  Timber thinning and prescribed fire projects on the [[Payette National Forest]] have proven to expand some of the existing populations of Northern Idaho ground squirrels.

==Southern Idaho ground squirrel (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;U. brunneus endemicus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)==
[[Image:Southern Idaho ground squirrel (Spermophilus brunneus endemicus), candidate.jpg|thumb|Southern Idaho ground squirrel]]
The southern Idaho ground squirrel can be found in an area about 30 by 70 kilometers (48 by 113 miles) extending from [[Emmett, Idaho]], northwest to [[Weiser, Idaho]] and the surrounding area of Squaw Butte, Midvale Hill, and Henley Basin in [[Gem County, Idaho|Gem]], [[Payette County, Idaho|Payette]], and [[Washington County, Idaho|Washington]] counties.

Its range is bounded on the south by the [[Payette River]], on the west by the [[Snake River]] and on the northeast by [[lava flow]]s. Their habitat is typified by rolling hills, basins, and flats at an altitude of between 670–975 meters (2,200-3,200 feet).

{{As of|2004}}, the Southern subspecies is a candidate [[endangered species]].
