&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Abydos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Greek: Άβυδος), an ancient city of [[Mysia]], in [[Asia Minor]], situated at Nara Burnu or [[Nagara Point]] on the best harbor on the Asiatic shore of the [[Hellespont]]. Across Abydos lies [[Sestus]] on the European side, marking one of the narrowest points of the [[Dardanelles]], slightly more than a nautical mile broad (the narrrowest point is at [[Çanakkale]]). The strategic site has been a prohibited zone in the 20th century. [[Hero and Leander]]&amp;apos;s story took place near Abydos.

Abydos was first mentioned in the catalogue of Trojan allies (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Iliad]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ii.836). It probably was  a [[Thracians|Thracian]] town, as [[Strabo]] has it, but was afterwards colonized by [[Miletus|Milesians]], with the consent of [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges, king of Lydia]], around 700 BC.  It was occupied by the Persians in 514 BC, and [[Darius the Great|Darius]] burnt it in 512 BC.  Here [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] built two [[pontoon bridge]]s later known as [[Xerxes&amp;apos; Pontoon Bridges]] and crossed the strait in 480 BC when he [[Greco-Persian Wars|invaded Greece]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Herodotus]].  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 7.34.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Abydos thereafter became a member of the [[Delian League]], until it revolted from Athenian rule in 411 BC.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Thucydides]].  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/thucydides/jthucbk8rv2.htm 8.61-2].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  It allied itself to [[History of Sparta|Sparta]], until 394 BC; King [[Agesilaus]] of Sparta crossed here while returning to Greece.  Abydos then passed under [[Achaemenid]] rule, until 334 BC.  [[Alexander the Great]] threw a spear to Abydos while crossing the strait and claimed Asia as his own.

Abydos is celebrated for the vigorous resistance it made against [[Philip V of Macedon]] in 200 BC.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Polybius]].  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/16*.html 16.29-34]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is famed in myth as the home of [[Hero and Leander|Leander]].  In literature, it is memorable from [[Byron]] having adopted its name in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Bride of Abydos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite Collier&amp;apos;s|Abydos}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It minted coins from the early 5th century BC to the mid-3rd century AD.

The town remained until late Byzantine times an important toll and customs station of the Hellespont, its importance thereafter being transferred to the [[Dardanelles]], after the building of the &amp;quot;Old Castles&amp;quot; by Sultan [[Mehmet II]] (c. 1456).
