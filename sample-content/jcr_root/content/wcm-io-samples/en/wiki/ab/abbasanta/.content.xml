&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Abbasanta&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-la|Ad Medias}}, {{lang-sc|Abbasànta}}) is a [[town]] and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[comune]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the [[province of Oristano]], [[Sardinia]] ([[Italy]]), and is located on the main road between [[Macomer]] and [[Oristano]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citebook|title=Coping with Tourists: European Reactions to Mass Tourism|author=Jeremy Boissevain|year=1996|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=1-57181-878-2}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Description==
Abbasanta sits on a [[lava]] [[plateau]] rich in [[cork oak]]s, [[olive]] trees and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;lentischi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The plateau arose from the lava flow of the Montiferru [[volcano]].
The [[landscape]] of the lava plateau is characterised by [[pasture]]s that are enclosed by dry-[[Rock (geology)|stone]] [[wall]]s which surround the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;tancas&amp;apos;&amp;apos; built in the 18th century. In the surrounding countryside, there are still some typical shelters (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;pinnete&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) made of stones and boughs by the [[shepherd]]s.

In the village the stone houses are characteristic. They are low and with few floors, without [[shed]]s, but usually with a back [[courtyard]] where some space is reserved for the domestic animals. This is a quite common [[architectural]] [[dwelling]] in an area traditionally involved  [[sheep]] farming rather than [[agriculture]].

The front room of the house is often a courtyard for [[chicken]]s, in the centre of which there is the [[hearth]] (in [[Sardinian language]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;su foghile&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), used for hanging and drying cured [[pork]] meat. Later, [[fireplaces]] replaced the hearths.

==History==
In [[ancient Rome|Roman]] times, the town, called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ad Medias&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was in the territory of the [[Æchilenenses]] or [[Cornenses]].

The village was built all around the two [[Church (building)|churches]] of Santa Amada and Santa Caterina (dedicated to [[Catherine of Alexandria]]). There was a clear separation between [[social classes]].

Until the 1950s the use of [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Sardinian language]] had distinct and complementary functions. Italian was the [[official]] language, used by the [[public administration]], while Sardinian was the language spoken home and among friends. The characteristic expressions of the [[dialect]] are usually inspired by the [[peasant]] and [[pastoral]] world. Many [[proverb]]s refer to the values of honesty, friendship, fidelity (of the woman), loyalty, parsimony and obedience to the divine will.

==Abbasanta&amp;apos;s plateau==
The whole Abbasanta&amp;apos;s plateau is rich in [[archaeology|archaeological]] [[monument]]s. Very close to the village is the [[nuraghe Losa]].
The most important country church is set on the site of Sant&amp;apos;Agostino (dedicated to [[Augustine of Hippo]]). Around the rural church, there are some characteristic small houses (in Sardinian language &amp;apos;&amp;apos;muristenes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;cumbessias&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) that host the [[pilgrim]]s during the religious feasts.
