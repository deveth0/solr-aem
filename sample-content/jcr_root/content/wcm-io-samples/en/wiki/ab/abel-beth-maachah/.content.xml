[[File:Morgan-bible-fl-46.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Illustration from the [[Morgan Bible]] of [[Joab]] approaching Abel-beth-maachah and [[Sheba (person)|Sheba&amp;apos;s]] head being thrown down (2 Samuel 20).]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Abel-beth-maachah&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (trans. &amp;quot;meadow (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Abel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) of the house (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Beth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) of [[Maacah]]&amp;quot;) was a city in the north of [[Israel]], in the neighbourhood of [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]] and [[Ijon]], in the [[tribe of Naphtali]].

It was a place of considerable strength and importance. It is called a &amp;quot;mother in Israel&amp;quot;, i.e., a
metropolis (2 Samuel 20:19). It was [[siege|besieged]] by [[Joab]] in his pursuit of [[Sheba (person)|Sheba]] (2 [[Books of Samuel|Sam.]] 20:14). An [[Wise woman of Abel|unnamed wise woman]] from Abel-beth-maachah convinced Joab not to destroy the city, since the people did not want to shelter Sheba. She told the people of the city to kill Sheba, and his head was thrown over the wall to Joab.

The city was also besieged by Benhadad (1 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 15:20) and by [[Tiglath-Pileser III|Tiglath-pileser]] (2 Kings 15:29) about 734 BC. It is elsewhere called Abel-maim, meadow of the waters, ([[2 Chronicles]] 16:4).

Its site is occupied by the modern Abil or Abil-el-kamh, on a rising ground to the east of the brook Derdarah, which flows through [[Hula Valley|the plain of Huleh]] into the [[River Jordan|Jordan]], about 6 miles to the west-north-west of Dan.
