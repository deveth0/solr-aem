&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Abrams Battle Tank&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, aka &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;M-1 Abrams Battle Tank&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for the [[Sega]] version, is a [[computer game]] developed by [[Dynamix]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] in 1988 for [[DOS]]. It was later ported to [[Mega Drive]] in 1991 by [[Realtime Games Software]]. Designed by [[Damon Slye]], the game is a 3D [[Vehicle simulation game|vehicle simulation]] of the [[M1 Abrams]] [[tank]], one of the first on the market.

The port from DOS to [[Sega Genesis]] was performed by [[Realtime Games|Realtime Games Software Ltd]] in the UK using their own 3D games engine that was earlier used in [[Carrier Command]] with some tweaks to adapt it to the Genesis and the needs of the tank scenario.

Although the simulation depicts the four crew positions, and is advertised as a simulation, gameplay is not actually very realistic; the missions are [[arcade game]]-like with a fixed sequence of actions to perform.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;CGW&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; The graphics were very good for their time, but reviews are mixed, with many players enjoying the &amp;quot;fun factor&amp;quot; introduced by the lack of realism, and others decrying it for the same reason.

==Reception==
The MS-DOS version of the game was reviewed in 1989 in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; #147 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &amp;quot;The Role of Computers&amp;quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Dragon147&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal

In particular, the commanding officer&amp;apos;s briefings, at one point threatening failure with execution, were derided as unprofessional and offensive to military personnel.&amp;lt;ref name = &amp;quot;CGW&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{citation | date = June 1989 | last = Brooks | first = M.
