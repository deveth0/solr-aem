        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Abacaenum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-grc|Ἀβάκαινον}};&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;so in [[Diodorus|Diod.]] and [[Stephanus of Byzantium|Steph. Byz.]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; {{lang|grc|Ἀβάκαινα}}&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;so in [[Ptolemy|Ptol.]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) was an ancient city of [[Sicily]], situated about 6.5&amp;amp;nbsp;km from the north coast, between [[Tyndaris]] (modern [[Tindari]]) and Mylae (modern [[Milazzo]]), and 13&amp;amp;nbsp;km from the former city.

==History==
Abacaenum was a city of the [[Siculi]], and does not appear to have ever received a [[ancient Greece|Greek]] colony, though it partook largely of the influence of Greek art and civilization. Its territory originally included that of Tyndaris, which was separated from it by the [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|elder Dionysius]] when he founded that city in [[396 BC|396 BCE]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bibliotheca historica]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; xiv. 78 § 5&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Dionysius defeated the Carthaginian general [[Mago (fleet commander)|Mago]] in the [[battle of Abacaenum]] in [[393 BC|393 BCE]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Diodorus Siculus, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bibliotheca historica&amp;apos;&amp;apos; xiv. 90. §§ 3-4&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; From the way in which it is mentioned in the wars of Dionysius, [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]], and [[Hiero II|Hieron]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Diodorus Siculus, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bibliotheca historica&amp;apos;&amp;apos; xiv. 90 § 3, xix. 65 § 6, xix. 110 § 4, xxii. 13 § 2&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; it is clear that it was a place of power and importance: but from the time of Hieron it disappears from history, and no mention is found of it in the [[In Verrem|Verrine orations]] of [[Cicero]]. Its name is, however, found in [[Ptolemy]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ptolemy iii. 4. § 12&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; so that it appears to have still continued to exist in his day. Its decline was probably owing to the increasing prosperity of the neighbouring city of Tyndaris.

There can be little doubt that the ruins visible in the time of [[Tommaso Fazello]], at the foot of the hill on which the modern town of [[Tripi]] is situated, were those of Abacaenum. He speaks of fragments of masonry, prostrate columns, and the vestiges of walls, indicating the site of a large city, but which had been destroyed to its foundations.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Tommaso Fazello]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;de Rebus Siculis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ix. 7; [[Cluverius]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sicil. Ant.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; p. 386.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Coinage==
[[File:Coin of Abacaenum.png|right|thumb|Coin of Abacaenum.]]There are found coins of Abacaenum, both in silver and copper. The boar and acorn, which are the common type of the former, evidently refer to the great forests of oak which still cover the neighboring mountains, and afford pasture to large herds of swine.
