&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Abbey Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a public park in [[Leicester]], [[England]], owned and managed by [[Leicester City Council]], through which the [[River Soar]] flows.

The park contains the remains of the 12th century [[Leicester Abbey]] and the ruins of Cavendish House (built in the 17th century by [[William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire]] using stone from the abbey).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The house was used by Charles I after the siege of Leicester during the [[English civil war]] in 1645; after he left, his soldiers set fire to it leaving the house gutted.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The charred stone window frame is still visible today.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The abbey ruins contain a memorial to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Thomas Wolsey]], who was laid to rest in the grounds.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} He died while en route from York to London on 29 November 1530; a statue of him stands next to the Park&amp;apos;s cafe.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The park has regularly{{when|date=May 2013}} won the [[Green Flag award]], a national award made annually to parks which reach a high standard.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It has formal [[garden]]s, a sensory garden, a boating lake and model boat lake, a [[miniature railway]], visitor centre, cafe, children&amp;apos;s play area with paddling pool, pets corner, [[tennis courts]], a bowling green, and a [[bandstand]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Abbey Park now also houses the offices and studios of [[Takeover Radio]] within one of its Gatehouse Lodges.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The Abbey has been the site of Archaeological training excavations by the University of Leicester Archaeological Services for Archaeology, for students at [[Leicester University]].&amp;lt;ref name=UoL&amp;gt;{{cite web|last=University of Leicester Archaeological Services|title=Leicester Abbey training excavation|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ulas/projects/leicesterabbeytraining.html|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
