The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;S1G reactor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[United States Naval reactor|naval reactor]] used by the [[United States Navy]] to provide [[electricity generation]] and [[Nuclear marine propulsion|propulsion]] on [[warship]]s.  The S1G designation stands for:

* S = [[Submarine]] platform
* 1 = First generation [[Nuclear reactor core|core]] designed by the contractor
* G = [[General Electric]] was the contracted designer

This [[nuclear reactor]] was constructed by General Electric as a prototype for the [[USS Seawolf (SSN-575)|USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Seawolf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SSN-575)]] submarine.  It was a [[liquid metal cooled reactor]] using pure [[sodium]] to cool the core instead of water, because the higher temperature of liquid sodium (compared to pressurized water) enabled the production of more superheated [[steam]] in the [[Steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generators]].  This resulted in a more efficient thermal cycle, yielding more [[Horsepower#Shaft horsepower|shaft horsepower]] for a given reactor size.  The reactor design had problems because of limited [[operating temperature]] constraints.  The major disadvantage of this concept was the ignition of sodium when exposed to air.

S1G was used for testing and training.  Eventually a sodium leak resulted in a fire, and the facility was shut down.  In the meantime, the [[S1W reactor|S1W]] and [[S2W reactor|S2W]] [[pressurized water reactor]]s, conceived for the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nautilus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (SSN-571)]], had demonstrated their superior reliability.  The S1G reactor facility and its [[Horton Sphere]] were later reused for the [[D1G reactor|D1G]] prototype destroyer reactor.
