&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;KBS-3&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (an abbreviation of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;kärnbränslesäkerhet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, nuclear fuel safety) is a technology for disposal of high-level [[radioactive waste]] developed in [[Sweden]] by [[Svensk Kärnbränslehantering AB]] (SKB) by appointment from Statens Strålskyddsinstitut (the government&amp;apos;s radiation protection agency).  The technology was developed by studying different natural storage facilities such as the [[natural nuclear fission reactor|natural reactor]] in [[Oklo]], [[Gabon]], and the uranium mine in [[Cigar Lake]], [[Canada]].  KBS-3 is also to be used in Finland at the [[Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository]], being built by [[Posiva]].

== General ==

The disposal method consists of the following steps:&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

* The waste is first stored in intermediate storage for 30 years.
* The waste is encapsulated in boron steel canisters.
* The boron steel canisters are encapsulated in [[copper]] ([[CuOFP]] alloy) capsules.
* The capsules are deposited in a layer of [[bentonite]] clay, in a circular hole, eight meters deep and with a diameter of two meters, drilled in a cave 500 metres down into [[crystalline rock]].
* After the storage facility is full, the drill hole is sealed and the site marked.
* After 100,000 years of storage, the radioactivity level of the waste is at the same level as that of [[uranium]] [[ore]] mined to make the fuel.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Manson Benedict, Thomas H. Pigford, Hans Levi (1981). &amp;quot;Nuclear Chemical Engineering&amp;quot;, McGraw-Hill, Toronto, 1981.  ISBN 0-07-004531-3. This work shows data (Figure 11.2) indicating that enriched fuel from a light water reactor, subjected to a typical burnup regime will be no more radioactive than the ore from which it was mined, after a period of about six hundred years.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

If the holes into the rock from the cave are drilled vertically, the method is called KBS-3V and if they are drilled horizontally it is called KBS-3H. The only method considered so far is KBS-3V.

== Facilities ==

The first facilities using this method will be located in [[Östhammar]], [[Sweden]], next to the [[Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant]], and in [[Eurajoki]], [[Finland]], at the [[Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository]] next to the [[Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

The Östhammar facility will have space for 6,000 capsules and the plan is to deposit 200 capsules in the storage annually.

In 2012, a research group at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm, Sweden, published research that suggests that that the copper capsules of KBS-3 are not as corrosion safe as SKB and Posiva claim.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.stralsakerhetsmyndigheten.se/Global/Publikationer/Rapport/Technical%20Note/2012/SSM-Rapport-2012-17.pdf
 | title = Technical Note 2012:17: Corrosion of copper canister
 | author = Peter Szakálos and Seshadri Seetharaman
 | publisher = [[Strålsäkerhetsmyndigheten]]
 | ISSN = 2000-0456
 | date = 2012
 | accessdate = 2012-12-30
 | format=PDF}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
The research group led by Peter Szakálos found that copper capsules would last only about 1,000 years, instead of the 100,000 years claimed by the companies. According to the research results, corrosion in pure copper advances at about one [[micrometre]] a year, whereas KBS-3 depends on a rate of corrosion that is a thousand times slower. In response, [[STUK]] (the Finnish nuclear safety official) has asked Posiva for further explanation, and independent research conducted in Finland has supported the results of Szakálos&amp;apos;s group. However, in public, Posiva dismissed the independent research in Sweden and Finland, referring to its own safety studies.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;
