&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;You Got the Right One, Baby, Uh Huh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; was a popular slogan for [[Pepsico]]&amp;apos;s [[Diet Pepsi]] brand in the United States and Canada from 1990 to 1993. A series of television ads featured singer [[Ray Charles]], surrounded by models, singing a song about Diet Pepsi, entitled &amp;quot;You Got the Right One Baby, Uh Huh&amp;quot;. The tag-phrase of the song included the words &amp;quot;Uh Huh!&amp;quot;, which, as part of the ad campaign, were featured on Diet Pepsi packaging. Later, after Diet Pepsi phased out the [[aspartame]] / [[saccharin]] mix in favor of a 100% aspartame formula, many commercials ended with an announcer saying, &amp;quot;With 100% Uh Huh&amp;quot; replacing the earlier &amp;quot;With 100% NutraSweet&amp;quot;.

The advertising campaign was created for Pepsi by BBD&amp;amp;O, a major New York advertising agency, and the song used in the commercials, entitled &amp;quot;Ray&amp;apos;s Song&amp;quot; was penned by the team at Sunday Productions, also of New York City.

Another songwriter penned a composition with the same tag-line, and unsuccessfully attempted to receive credit for the commercial.

According to him: The song was written (as a love song) 1989 by Arthur Takeall of [[Annapolis, Maryland]], first performed over radio station [[WEBB]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]. Takeall has a registered copyright on the song and owner of the Federal Registered Trademark, &amp;quot;You Got the Right One, Baby, Uh Huh&amp;quot;.

==Version==
The [[India]]n version of the slogan, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yehi hai right choice, Baby&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (This is the Right Choice, Baby) in [[Hinglish]], by Pepsi became immense popular in the 1990s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/features/brand-equity/Pepsi-ads-From-Yehi-hai-right-choice-to-catering-youngistaan/articleshow/7103067.cms|title=Pepsi ads: From &amp;apos;Yehi hai right choice&amp;apos; to catering youngistaan|date=15 Dec, 2010|work=[[The Economic Times]]}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The TV commercial directed the [[Mukul Anand]], featured singer [[Remo Fernandes]] and actress [[Juhi Chawla]], while its sequel saw actor [[Aamir Khan]] and [[Aishwariya Rai]], then a model.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2kMLasc1jI Yeh hi hai right choice baby - classic Pepsi TVC 1]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and has since become a [[catchphrase]] in Indian [[popular culture]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/Yehi-hai-right-choice-baby/Article1-443435.aspx Yehi hai right choice, baby] [[Hindustan Times]], New Delhi, August 15, 2009.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==In popular culture==
The song&amp;apos;s title quickly became a [[catchphrase]] across North America, and was referenced in various television shows and movies of the time, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Cosby Show]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Foofur]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Rookie of the Year (film)|Rookie of the Year]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The commercials themselves played on the parodies. One series of commercials showed people who opened cans of Diet Pepsi being thanked by Ray Charles and his backup singers with an &amp;quot;uh huh&amp;quot; (or the occasion &amp;quot;nuh uh&amp;quot; for people who drank diet sodas from rival companies). Another commercial showed unsuccessful auditions with gangsta rappers, heavy metal bands and opera singers all singing &amp;quot;you got the right one baby&amp;quot;, before Diet Pepsi &amp;quot;cast&amp;quot; Ray Charles.
