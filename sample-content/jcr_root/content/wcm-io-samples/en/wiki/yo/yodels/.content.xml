&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yodels&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were frosted, cream-filled cakes made by the [[Drake&amp;apos;s]] company, which was owned by the [[Hostess Brands]]. Yodels were distributed on the east coast of the [[United States]]. They were similar to [[HoHos]], which were made by [[Hostess (brand)|Hostess]].

Production of Yodels ceased on Nov. 16, 2012, when Hostess Brands, owner of the iconic pastry, ceased operations following a strike by a bakery union

Each plastic package of Yodels contains three cakes, totaling 440 calories and three grams of saturated fat. Yodels are also sold in boxes containing five or eight individually wrapped pairs of cakes (a total of ten or 16). Formerly Yodels used a different formula, with thicker, denser cake and came packaged in foil. This was changed by the late 80s to the current recipe and packaging.

The snacks were featured in the movie &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in which the main character (played by [[Adam Sandler]]) becomes extremely fat after eating Yodels for ten years.

They are often named as a favorite snack food by [[Fox News Channel]] vice president and anchor, [[Neil Cavuto]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,133708,00.html FOXNews.com - No More Yodels? - Neil Cavuto | Your World&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,24740,00.html FOXNews.com - Common Sense: Butt Out, Washington! - Neil Cavuto | Your World&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,140811,00.html FOXNews.com - Losing Our Guts? - Neil Cavuto | Your World&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,242452,00.html FOXNews.com - Free Tip for Democrats - Neil Cavuto | Your World&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,132262,00.html FOXNews.com - Look Who&amp;apos;s Coming to Dinner - Neil Cavuto | Your World&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,34590,00.html FOXNews.com - Trying to Make Sense of It All - Neil Cavuto | Your World&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,80243,00.html FOXNews.com - Tips for CEOs - Neil Cavuto | Your World&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

They are also shared by the characters [[Ray Barone]] and [[Robert Barone]] in Ray&amp;apos;s childhood bedroom after Robert was gored by a bull in the line of duty on the sitcom &amp;quot;[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]&amp;quot; and are a favorite of character [[Doug Heffernan]] on the &amp;quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&amp;quot; spinoff &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[King of Queens]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.tv.com/the-king-of-queens/lush-life/episode/129607/summary.html The King of Queens: Lush Life - TV.com&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.tv.com/the-king-of-queens/offensive-fowl/episode/1013220/summary.html The King of Queens: Offensive Fowl - TV.com&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

They are named as the preferred food source of the character Jeri in the comic strip &amp;apos;&amp;apos;PreTeena&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; [http://news.yahoo.com/comics/preteena Oct. 24, 2010]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
In the episode &amp;quot;[[The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons]]&amp;quot; of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Simpsons]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Homer Simpson is forced to choose between buying a Yodel or a winning lottery ticket.  He ultimately chooses the Yodel.
