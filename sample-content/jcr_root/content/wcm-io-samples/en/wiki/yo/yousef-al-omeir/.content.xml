Yousef Bin Omeir comes from one of the wealthiest families of Abu Dhabi. His family has extensive business interests in the country. Their businesses include licenses awarded to them to import choice goods into the country, real estate, construction, petroleum services and supply, military equipment supply and is also a large player in the service sector. Omeir Travels &amp;amp; Omeir Holidays are the biggest [[travel agency]] in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and Omeir Automobiles is the sole importer of Peugeot cars into the UAE.

Al Omeir also sits on the UAE&amp;apos;s Supreme Petroleum Council, a powerful body that is responsible for the vast [[oil reserves]]  of the country and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.
