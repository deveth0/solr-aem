&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Young Virgin Auto-Sodomized by the Horns of Her Own Chastity&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 1954 painting by [[Salvador Dalí]]. During the 1950s, Dalí painted many of his subjects as composed of [[rhinoceros]] horns. Here, the Young Virgin&amp;apos;s buttocks consist of four converging horns; &amp;quot;as the horns simultaneously comprise and threaten to sodomise the callipygian figure, she is effectively (auto) sodomised by her own constitution.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;King, Elliott in Dawn Ades (ed.), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dalí&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Milan: Bompiani Arte, 2004), 378-379&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Dalí&amp;apos;s inspiration for the image appears to have come from [[Vermeer]], one of a handful of artists regarded by Dalí as masters. Specifically, Vermeer&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The_Lacemaker_(Vermeer)|The Lacemaker]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; seems to have been the galvanising element, with its convergent curves which focus on the subject&amp;apos;s fingers and so to the penetration point of her needle - which as Dalí has pointed out is merely implied and not actually painted. In a stunt, Dalí set up his easel before Vermeer&amp;apos;s original with the expressed intent of making a copy.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} The result however was this painting, which consciously uses Vermeer&amp;apos;s focal-point arrangement, albeit to entirely different effect.

The painting, formerly in the collection of [[The Playboy Mansion]] (Playboy Enterprises sold the painting in [[London]] in 2003 for 1.35 million pounds&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://observer.com/2003/02/blackandwhite-night/ Black-and-White Night] - &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The New York Observer]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 17 February 2003&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;), recalls his depiction of his sister Ana María in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Figure at a Window&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1925), and has therefore been read by some critics  as a nasty jab at his sister, punishing her for publishing a biography on Dalí that presented a quite negative point of view;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Bradbury, Kirsten, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dalí(Essential Art)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Bath: Paragon Publishing, 2001), p. 30&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; it has also been interpreted as a painting of Gala, though in fact the figure is based on a photograph from a 1930s sex magazine.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Robert Descharnes, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dalí, L&amp;apos;héritage infernal&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Paris: Éditions Ramsay/La Marge, 2002), 72.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1958, Dalí wrote, &amp;quot;Paradoxically, this painting, which has an erotic appearance, is the most chaste of all.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Morse, A. Reynolds, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dalí: A Study of His Life and Work&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Greenwich: New York Graphic Society, 1958), 81.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
