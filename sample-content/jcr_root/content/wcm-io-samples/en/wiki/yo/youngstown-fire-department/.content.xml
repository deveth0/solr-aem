The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Youngstown Fire Department&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; provides essential fire and allied public safety services for the City of [[Youngstown, Ohio]].

The Youngstown Fire Department operates nine [[fire station]]s. The 134 firefighters that are employed by the department operate on one of three turns (A, B, &amp;amp; C) and work 24 hours on, 48 hours off. The department also has 1 Arson Investigator, 3 Inspectors, a Chief&amp;apos;s Secretary and a Mechanic.

==History==
[[Image:YoungstownFire.jpg|thumb|left|The Youngstown Fire Department fighting one of the many arson fires that broke out in late 2005 and early 2006 on the city&amp;apos;s North Side.]]
Established in 1868 as the all-volunteer [[David Tod|Governor Tod Engine Company]], the department has grown over the years. In 1891, the [[Volunteer fire department|volunteer department]] was disbanded as the city grew and the need for a full-time force of career firefighters became evident. By 1955, the department had grown to operate from 15 fire stations, but this would last only 15 years. By the early 1970s, with the steel industry on its way out of Youngstown, the department began to close companies. First were fire stations #4 and #11. Others would follow including several on the city&amp;apos;s North and South Sides.

==Mission statement==

The men and women of the Department are committed to eliminating threats to the lives, safety and property of the Youngstown community. They provide services through a combination of education, prevention and effective response to fire, medical and environmental emergencies.
