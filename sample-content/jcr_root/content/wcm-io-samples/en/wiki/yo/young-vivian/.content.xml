&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mititaiagimene Young Vivian&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 12 November 1935) is a [[Niue]]an politician who has twice been the [[Premier of Niue|premier]] of his country. Representing the [[Niue People&amp;apos;s Action Party]], he defeated sitting premier [[Sani Lakatani]] in May 2002 elections. Vivian had previously served as premier for a brief period from 12 December 1992 to 9 March 1993 following the death of Sir [[Robert Rex]]. He had also previously been the secretary general of the [[Pacific Community]] from 1979 until 1982. He was re-elected to the [[Niue Assembly]] (national Parliament) unopposed in [[Niuean general election, 2005|elections that were held in April 2005]]. He was again re-elected unopposed to Parliament in the [[Niuean general election, 2008|2008 elections]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;amp;id=39950 &amp;quot;Niue Premier and Cabinet returned un-opposed as nominations close&amp;quot;], Radio New Zealand International, 23 May 2008&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; However, he lost his position as premier when he was successfully challenged by fellow MP [[Toke Talagi]] after that election. Talagi was elected premier by the Assembly, with fourteen votes to Vivian&amp;apos;s five, and one abstaining.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200806/s2279886.htm?tab=latest &amp;quot;Talagi declared new Niue premier&amp;quot;], ABC Radio Australia, 19 June 2008&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He has also been Niue&amp;apos;s Minister of Health and Minister of Tourism.

In his political career, which has spanned over 30 years, Young Vivian has held most (if not all) ministerial portfolios in Niue&amp;apos;s government – mostly during his many years as a Cabinet Minister in the governments of Sir Robert Rex (in office 1974–1992) and of [[Frank Lui]] (in office 1993–1999).
