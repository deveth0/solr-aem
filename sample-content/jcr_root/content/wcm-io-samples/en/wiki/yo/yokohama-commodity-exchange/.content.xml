&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yokohama Commodity Exchange&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Y-COM) was a [[futures exchange]] based in [[Yokohama]], [[Japan]] which operated from 1998 to 2006.

== History ==

The exchange was formed in 1998 from the merger of the [[Yokohama Raw Silk Exchange]] ([[:ja:横浜生絲取引所|横浜生絲取引所]]) and the [[Maebashi Dried Cocoon Exchange]] ([[:ja:前橋繭糸取引所|前橋繭糸取引所]]).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ycom&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.y-com.or.jp Yokohama Commodity Exchange web site], as at 2005 (site now gone)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

As of 1 April 2006 the exchange merged into the [[Tokyo Grain Exchange]] ([[:ja:東京穀物商品取引所|東京穀物商品取引所]]),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.tge.or.jp/english/about/about_02.shtml Exchange History page] at the [[Tokyo Grain Exchange]] (as at May 2006)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; with [[silk]] and vegetables contracts moved there.  The exchange&amp;apos;s closure was due to declining trading volumes.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000080&amp;amp;refer=asia&amp;amp;sid=aVvZpCczT0Uc Japan&amp;apos;s Commodities Exchanges Falter as Internet Trades Surge] by Hector Forster and Fumishige Asanogold, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] news, 27 April 2006&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Although 2005 and 2006 were boom times in commodity speculation in other areas like oil and metals, that action didn&amp;apos;t extend to Yokohama.

Y-COM&amp;apos;s end as a separate organisation was another in an ongoing consolidation of exchanges in Japan.  In 1983 for instance there were 19 regional exchanges, with the closure of Y-COM there remained only 6.

== Operations ==

Trading was conducted in an &amp;quot;[[Itayose]]&amp;quot; auction-like system.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ycom&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  There were four sessions each day, in which a single price was established for each contract month for each commodity.

Commodities traded were
* [[Potatoes]] &amp;amp;mdash; Japanese produced [[Dansyaku]] size &amp;quot;L&amp;quot;
* Japanese raw [[silk]] &amp;amp;mdash; 27 [[denier (measure)|denier]] 3A produced in Japan
* [[Vegetable]]s &amp;amp;mdash; cash settled average of several vegetable prices

In the past dried [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoons]] were traded.
