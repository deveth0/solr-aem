&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;You Want It, You Got It&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is [[Bryan Adams]]&amp;apos;s second solo album, and was released in 1981 (see [[1981 in music]]). This was the album that established the sound that Adams has retained throughout his recording career. Unlike the debut album where Adams and Vallance played most of the instruments themselves, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;You Want It You Got It&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was recorded live in the studio. It was recorded and mixed in NYC over a two-week period during the spring of 1981. The album was originally to be titled &amp;quot;Bryan Adams Hasn&amp;apos;t Heard Of You Either&amp;quot; (due to critics&amp;apos; indifference to his first album and singles) but Adams&amp;apos;s sense of humour didn&amp;apos;t make it past the gate keepers at the record company, who opted for the safer title.

== Overview ==
The first single &amp;quot;Lonely Nights&amp;quot; broke out of the Northeast of America long before it broke anywhere else, partially due to a couple of late night DJs working in Rochester, Albany and Syracuse. Within a few months the album had been picked up across the country and Adams was soon on tour doing clubs and noon hour concerts for radio stations, as well as support to such acts as The Kinks and Foreigner. Two further singles &amp;apos;Coming Home&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;Fits Ya Good&amp;apos; were very well received, the latter becoming Adams&amp;apos; debut Top 40 hit in Canada.

It was the shape of things to come, for as momentum increased, so did the touring. Although the album was only marginally successful, it laid down the groundwork for the forthcoming album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cuts Like a Knife&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In later years, many of the songs were recorded by other artists. Some examples are &amp;quot;Jealousy&amp;quot; by Prism, &amp;quot;Tonight&amp;quot; by Randy Meisner, and &amp;quot;Fits Ya Good&amp;quot; by Tove Naess, to name a few.
