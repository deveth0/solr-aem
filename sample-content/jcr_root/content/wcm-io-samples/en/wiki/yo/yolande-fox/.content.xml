&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yolande Betbeze Fox&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1929 in [[Mobile, Alabama]]) was [[Miss America]] in 1951.

Fox (then Betbeze) entered [[Miss Alabama]] for the scholarship opportunities the pageant presented.  Having been educated in a [[convent school]], she was reluctant to pose in a [[swimsuit]] and refused to do so after she won Miss America.

That led the swim suit company, [[Catalina swimwear|Catalina]], to withdraw their [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship of the Miss America pageant and eventually brought about the creation of the rival [[Miss USA]] pageant.

The Miss America Organization has claimed that Fox&amp;apos;s (then Betbeze&amp;apos;s) actions were pivotal in directing pageant progress towards recognizing intellect, values, and leadership abilities, rather than focusing on beauty alone.  From then on the Miss America pageant concentrated more on scholarship than beauty.

Fox was an [[opera]] singer and did gain a reputation in that area. She was occasionally seen &amp;quot;dating&amp;quot; baseballer [[Joe Dimaggio]], although it was later revealed they were only close friends.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/dimaggiobook1.html ESPN.com - Major League Baseball - DiMaggio book: Business and pleasure&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  She married Matthew Fox and they had one daughter.  After her husband&amp;apos;s death, she moved to [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.]] where she was part of a fun-loving and elite crowd called &amp;quot;The Swing Set.&amp;quot;{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} She had a relationship with [[Cherif Guellal]] until his death.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Cherif Guellal dies at 76; Algerian resistance fighter and diplomat|first=Adam|last=Bernstein|date=April 13, 2009|accessdate=April 13, 2009|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-cherif-guellal13-2009apr13,0,5184367.story}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Fox has been active in the [[feminist movement]].
