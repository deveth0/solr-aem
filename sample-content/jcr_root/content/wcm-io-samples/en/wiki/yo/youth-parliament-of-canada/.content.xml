The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Youth Parliament of Canada/Parlement jeunesse du Canada&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;YPJ Canada&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was a [[youth]] [[Model parliament|model]] [[parliament]] that met bi-annually, and later annually, in the 1980s. The delegates to YPJ Canada were drawn mostly from the eight provincial youth parliaments then operating in [[Canada]].

In 1977, representatives from seven of the eight youth parliaments met to discuss the organization of a national youth parliament. This meeting resulted in the creation of the National Youth Parliament Association (NYPA). The NYPA was a federally incorporated [[non-profit organization]]. Two representatives from each provincial youth parliament were appointed as directors of the NYPA, who in turn appointed a six-member executive.

The first session of YPJ Canada met during August 16–23, 1980. The 110 delegates,  met in the [[Canadian Senate|Senate]] chambers of the [[Parliament Hill|Canadian Parliament Buildings]] in [[Ottawa]]. YPJ Canada modeled itself on the [[Westminster system|Westminster Parliamentary system]], adopting its own rules based upon [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] procedures. While YPJ Canada had a [[Prime Minister]], [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Leader of the Opposition]], [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], [[shadow cabinet]], and committee system similar to a real parliament, the members of YPJ Canada did not represent any [[Political party|political parties]]. At all times, each member, including cabinet ministers, was entitled to vote according to conscience.

YPJ Canada usually had eight cabinet ministers, one from each of the provincial youth parliaments. Each minister would introduce &amp;quot;[[legislation]]&amp;quot; for debate. Unlike some of the provincial youth parliaments, YPJ Canada legislation was never for the establishment of any form of ongoing project. The [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] would be limited to the consideration of local, national and international issues of the day. Debates occurred in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], with simultaneous translation available for all delegates.

By the late 1980s, the NYPA was unable to raise the funds necessary to sponsor the annual YPJ Canada sessions. This, among other reasons, led to the collapse of YPJ Canada. The 8th session held in the summer of 1990 was billed as the &amp;quot;10th anniversary session&amp;quot;. The following session was the last.
