&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;You Suffer&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a song by the British [[grindcore]] band [[Napalm Death]], from their debut album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Scum (Napalm Death album)|Scum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The song has earned a place in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Guinness Book of Records]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as the shortest recorded song ever.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;OCW&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.ocweekly.com/music/music/extreme-extremeness/24665/ Orange County Weekly article]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  It is precisely 1.316 seconds long.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;OCW&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

The song was written by band members [[Nicholas Bullen]] and [[Justin Broadrick]] during the sessions for the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[From Enslavement to Obliteration]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; demo recording in March 1986, and is featured on the album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Scum (Napalm Death album)|Scum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, released in 1987.

According to Broadrick: {{cquote|&amp;quot;You Suffer&amp;quot; was largely a comedy thing, one-second song. Utterly retarded. It&amp;apos;s ridiculous, but it was hilarious. We played that song in front of 30 local kids, like, every weekend. We played that song 30 times. It was a laugh.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Kory Grow, &amp;quot;Slaves to the Grind,&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Precious Metal: Decibel Presents the Stories Behind 25 Extreme Metal Masterpieces&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Albert Mudrian, ed., Da Capo Press, p. 61.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;}}

Nic Bullen said that the brevity of the song was inspired by [[Wehrmacht (band)|Wehrmacht]]&amp;apos;s 1985 song &amp;quot;E!&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Grow, p. 62.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Zak Smith]] quotes the lyrics to the song, which he describes as the &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;shortest&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[punk rock|punk]] song on the subject of suffering (or any subject)&amp;quot; at the conclusion of his memoir &amp;apos;&amp;apos;We Did Porn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Zak Smith, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;We Did Porn: Memoir and Drawings&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Tin House Books, p. 475.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Single release==
In 1989 the song appeared on one side of a 7&amp;quot; single given away free with copies of a compilation album entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grindcrusher&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The song on the other side, &amp;quot;Mega-Armageddon Death Part 3&amp;quot; by the [[Electro Hippies]], also lasts approximately one second, making the disc the shortest single ever released. Each side features one groove at the outer edge of the disc containing the music (with the rest of the surface containing etched writing and cartoons).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.earache.com/catalog/mosh012.html Grindcrusher page on the Earache Records website]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Video==
To coincide with the release of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Scum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[DualDisc]] in March 2007, a music video produced by Earache records was released for the song.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;amp;newsitemID=68684 Roadrunner Records news story]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
