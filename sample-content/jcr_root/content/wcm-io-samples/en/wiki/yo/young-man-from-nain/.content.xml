The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;young man from Nain&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the widow&amp;apos;s son whom [[Christ]] raised from the dead. He did so during the young man&amp;apos;s burial in the village of [[Nain, Israel]], two miles south of [[Mount Tabor]]. This is told in the [[Gospel of Luke]] 7:11-17.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Luke&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Fred Craddock]] 2009 ISBN 0664234356 page 98&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This is the first of three [[miracles of Jesus ]] in the [[canonical gospels]] in which he raises the dead, the other two being [[Daughter of Jairus]] and [[Raising of Lazarus]].

The miracle is described thus:

{{Quotation|11 Soon afterward Jesus went to a town named Nain, accompanied by His disciples and a large crowd. 12 And when He arrived at the gate of the town, a funeral procession was coming out.  A young man had died, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.  And a large crowd from the town was with her. 13 And when the Lord saw her, His heart was filled with pity for her, and He said to her, “Do not weep”. 14 Then He walked over and touched the coffin, while the pallbearers stood still.  Jesus said to the dead man, “Young man, I say to thee, arise!” And he who was dead, sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.

16 Then they all were filled with awe and praised God.  And they said, “A great prophet has risen among us”, and “God has visited His people”.

17 This news about Jesus went out through all the country and the surrounding territory.
