&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;You&amp;apos;re All Worthless And Weak&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the first live album by heavy metal band [[Gwar]]. It was recorded at the 9:30 Club in [[Washington, DC]], on [[Halloween]]. It features the return of Sexecutioner and Sleazy P. Martini, as well as Techno Destructo and his brother Bozo Destructo. The show was also one of the last appearances of [[Slymenstra Hymen]], though she isn&amp;apos;t heard. At first, it was exclusively available to members of the Total Slavery Fan Club but it was later made available to the general public through the band&amp;apos;s official website. The album has since gone out of print. [[The Gwarnage Campaign]] is made up of videos taken from this show, with only a few tracks taken from other concerts of the tour. The title taken from a line in the film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Animal House]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
