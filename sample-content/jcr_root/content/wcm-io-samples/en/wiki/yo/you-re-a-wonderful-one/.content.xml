&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;You&amp;apos;re a Wonderful One&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a popular recording written by [[Holland–Dozier–Holland]] and recorded and released as a single by [[Marvin Gaye]], released in 1964 on the [[Motown|Tamla]] label.

The song had the narrator praising his &amp;quot;wonderful one&amp;quot; for loving him and for &amp;quot;always (being) around&amp;quot; him. Gaye is helped along on this song by [[The Supremes]] on background. The group had earlier backed him on &amp;quot;[[Can I Get a Witness]]&amp;quot;. Musically, [[The Funk Brothers]] took elements of Chuck Berry&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Memphis&amp;quot; single and incorporated it into the intro of this song. The song eventually charted at number fifteen on the pop charts and number three on the R&amp;amp;B singles chart.

It was produced by [[Holland–Dozier–Holland]], who worked with Gaye on &amp;quot;Witness&amp;quot; and later &amp;quot;[[How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)]]&amp;quot; by Gaye a few months later giving him his biggest success as a solo artist until &amp;quot;[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]&amp;quot; in 1968.
