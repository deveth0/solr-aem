==History==
[[Yogi Bhajan]], an Indian spiritual teacher who brought the Sikh religion to the West, began teaching [[Kundalini Yoga]] in America in 1969. After each yoga class, he served a special spice tea to his students, which they affectionately named &amp;quot;Yogi Tea&amp;quot;. The tea was a blend of five traditional [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] spices: [[cardamom]] seed, [[cinnamon]] bark, [[clove]] bud, [[ginger|ginger root]] and [[black pepper]]. Ayurvedic medicine holds that this combination of spices has unique, healthful properties, so they are still included in many current Yogi Tea formulas.

In the 1970s, students of Yogi Bhajan opened Golden Temple Vegetarian Restaurants in the United States, Canada and Europe. Through these restaurants, the first batches of Yogi Tea were sold to the public, and by 1984, the Yogi Tea Company was born. Over the next couple of years, the business grew to nationwide distribution, with three flavors of finely ground spices packaged in teabags. Then in 1988, Yogi Teaâ€™s team of herbalists expanded the line to include a number of formulas developed to address specific health needs.

In 2010 Yogi Tea was sued by Yogi Bhajan&amp;apos;s widow Bibiji Inderjit Kaur Puri,&amp;lt;ref name=eurg/&amp;gt; and the State of Oregon.&amp;lt;ref name=orgstate&amp;gt;{{Citation| last = McDonald| first = Sherri Buri| title = State targets Golden Temple| newspaper = The Eugene Register Guard| date = November 10, 2010| url = | archiveurl =| archivedate =| accessdate = }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The suits allege that trusted advisers of the Yogi had forged documents regarding to their take-over of the company, exclusion of the family from the board, excessive compensation for the executives, and the abandonment of what Bibiji describes as orthodox Sikh practices.&amp;lt;ref name=eurg/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Records in lawsuit claim Golden Temple executives drew excessive compensation|url=http://www.statesmanjournal.com/article/20110513/BUSINESS/105130316/Records-lawsuit-claim-Golden-Temple-executives-drew-excessive-compensation?odyssey=mod{{!}}newswell|text|Home|p|accessdate=14 May 2011|newspaper=[[Statesman Journal]]|date=May. 12, 2011|agency=The Associated Press}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The 2007 sale spurred numerous other lawsuits, including one against law firm [[Schwabe, Williamson &amp;amp; Wyatt]], as well as the parent company filing for bankruptcy protection.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|last=Culverwell|first=Wendy|title=Schwabe Williamson sued for $230M in Yogi Bhajan-related suit|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/2012/02/suits-fly-when-100m-company-sold-for.html|accessdate=February 24, 2012|newspaper=Portland Business Journal|date=February 24, 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
