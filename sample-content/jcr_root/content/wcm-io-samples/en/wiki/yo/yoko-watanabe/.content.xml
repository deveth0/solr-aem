        text="&lt;p&gt;{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yoko Watanabe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|渡辺 葉子|Watanabe Yōko|extra=1953 &amp;amp;ndash; July 15, 2004}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[opera]]tic [[soprano]] who spent much of her career singing the title role of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Madame Butterfly]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; all over [[Europe]].

She was also known for her large repertoire including such works as Micaela in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Carmen]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Donna Elvira in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Don Giovanni]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Marguerite in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and Amelia in [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Simon Boccanegra]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Watanabe died after a long battle with [[cancer]] in her [[Milan]] home at the age of 51.

== Career ==
Yoko graduated from the [[Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]] in 1976 then she left for Italy to study opera. She spent two years at an institute tied to [[La Scala]], Milan&amp;apos;s opera house.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040804/news_1m4watanabe.htmlphp&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1978, the 25-year-old Ms. Watanabe made her debut in Europe, then mostly performed in Italy. She returned to Japan in 1985 for her much-celebrated first performance at home with the [[Fujiwara Opera troupe]], as Butterfly in Puccini&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;[[Madama Butterfly]].&amp;quot; It was to be her signature role.
