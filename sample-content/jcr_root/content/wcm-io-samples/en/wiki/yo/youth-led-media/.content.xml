        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Youth-led media&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is any effort created, planned, implemented, and reflected upon by young people in the form of [[Mass media|media]], including websites, newspapers, television shows and publications.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.freechild.org/youthmedia.htm Youth Media Info Center], [[Freechild Project]]. Retrieved 11/2/08.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Caudhurī, A. (2003) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Media in Times of Crisis: National and International Issues&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Movement==
These efforts form the basis of an international movement born in the early 1970s in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], [[United States|U.S.]] by the publishing arm of a [[left-wing]], teen-led organization called [[Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor]], which existed from 1970 to 1980. One of its founders went on to form the New York City-based Youth Communication, a youth-led media program for young people in foster care. Another organization in the early movement was [[Children&amp;apos;s Express]], which operates programs around the world.

In the early 1990s this movement gained new expression in the United States in response to growing [[media bias]] against youth, i.e. the hyper-sensationalization of youth violence ala &amp;quot;[[superpredators]]&amp;quot;, and continued to grow due to the &amp;quot;Columbine&amp;quot; shootings. The first online, teen-written newspaper, [http://readthetattoo.com/ The Tattoo], began in 1994 with a promise of giving voice to teens. This movement features hundreds of individuals and organizations working across the United States to promote the roles of young people in society and in the media.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Coryat, D. (n.d.) &amp;quot;Challenging the silences and omissions of dominant media: Youth-led media collectives in Colombia,&amp;quot; Youth Media Reporter. Retrieved 11/2/08.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Demonstrating the wide reach of youth-led media a program in [[Oakland, California]] called [[Youth Radio]] has been featured across national media outlets in the U.S., including NPR and PBS. Other examples include the [[Blunt Youth Radio Project]] provides an hour-long, weekly, youth-produced public affairs radio show on [[WMPG]] in [[Portland, Maine]]. A general interest magazine called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Nang!]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is produced and distributed on a quarterly basis to 14-21 year olds in [[London]]. [[Speak Africa]] is a Pan-African youth-produced multi-media communication initiative that works in print, radio, TV, the Internet and community theatre, and the [[Vera Project]] is an all-ages, non-profit youth music organization in [[Seattle, Washington]].

There are currently youth-led media programs and organizations around the world, including Central and South America,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;White, T.
