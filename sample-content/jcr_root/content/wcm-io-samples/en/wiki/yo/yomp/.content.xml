[[File:Heading into Port Stanley.jpg|thumb|250px|Heading into [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] June 1982, The &amp;quot;Yomper,&amp;quot; an iconic image of the [[Falklands War]].]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yomp&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is [[Royal Marines]] [[slang]] describing a long-distance march carrying full kit.
The origin of the word is unclear. It was popularized by journalistic coverage in 1982 during the  [[Falklands War]].
It has been compared to the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;yump&amp;apos;&amp;apos; used in rally-driving in the sense of &amp;quot;to leave the ground when taking a crest at speed&amp;quot;, apparently a variant of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[:wikt:jump|jump]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;John Ayto, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Movers And Shakers: A Chronology of Words That Shaped Our Age&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 225.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[British Army]] slang for the same thing is &amp;apos;tab&amp;apos;, of equally unknown origin (one suggestion would interpret it as an [[acronym]] of Tactical Advance to Battle{{cn|date=June 2013}}).

The most famous yomp of recent times was during the 1982 [[Falklands War]]. After disembarking from ships at [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]] on [[East Falkland]], on 21 May 1982, Royal Marines and members of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] yomped (and tabbed) with their equipment across the islands, covering {{convert|56|mi|km}}&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Chapter 21 The Bridgehead and Beyond: &amp;quot;There were two considerations. First, the distance between Stanley and San Carlos was some &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;56&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; miles and given the problems posed by the terrain it would take at least eight days to cover the ground. Movement would be &amp;apos;under constant enemy fire from the air, in an area without cover, wood, drinking water or means of subsistence&amp;apos;. When his men arrived, worn out by the long trek, they would have to go into immediate action against an enemy well prepared and supported by field artillery.&amp;quot; - [[Lawrence Freedman]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Signals of War, The Falklands Conflict of 1982&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1990, Faber and Faber-London, ISBN 978-0-571-14116-6&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  in three days carrying {{convert|80|lb|kg}}&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Modern Land Combat&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1987, editor Bernard Fitzsimons, Salamander Books Ltd., ISBN 978-1-85501-165-6&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; loads.

Media coverage of this war saw the term &amp;apos;yomp&amp;apos; become well known and in general use. A computer game called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Yomp (video game)|Yomp]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was produced by Virgin Games shortly after the Falklands conflict. However, the term has since faded somewhat from general use in the decades since the end of the Falklands war.

After landing with 40 Commando at [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]], Holdgate accompanied British forces across the Falklands War zone taking hundreds of photographs.  The photograph of 24 year old Corporal Peter Robinson was taken in June 1982 as the Royal Marines proceeded along the Moody Brook track towards [[Port Stanley, Falkland Islands|Port Stanley]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web

When news of the [[Falklands War Argentine surrender|surrender of Argentine forces]] was received, Corporal Robinson produced a [[Union Flag]] from his pack and attached it to the aerial of his radio with masking tape.
