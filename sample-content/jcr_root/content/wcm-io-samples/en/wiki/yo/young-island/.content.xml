&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Young Island&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{coord|66|17|S|162|25|E|}}) is the northernmost and westernmost of the three main islands in the uninhabited [[Balleny Islands]] group located in the [[Southern Ocean]]. It lies {{convert|8|km|mi}} northwest of [[Buckle Island]], some {{convert|115|km|mi}} north-northeast of [[Belousov Point]] on the Antarctic mainland.

The island is roughly semi-oval in shape, with a long straight east coast and a curved west coast meeting at Cape Scoresby in the south and Cape Ellsworth in the north. The distance between these two capes is {{convert|11|km|mi}}, and at its widest the island is {{convert|3.5|km|mi}} across. The island is volcanic, with active [[fumarole]]s, and a height of {{convert|1340|m|ft|abbr=off}}. It is entirely covered with snow.

Several small islets lie in the channel separating Cape Scoresby and Buckle Island, the largest of which is [[Borradaile Island]]. Several [[sea stack]]s lie off the island&amp;apos;s northern tip. These are known as the Seal Rocks.

The island forms part of the [[Ross Dependency]], claimed by [[New Zealand]] (see [[Antarctic territorial claims]]).
