{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yone Minagawa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|皆川 ヨ子|Minagawa Yone|4 January 1893 – 13 August 2007}} was a Japanese [[supercentenarian]] who was [[oldest people|the world&amp;apos;s oldest living person]] from 29 January 2007 until her death of old age, [[list of the oldest people|aged 114 years 221 days]]. Although the previous holder of the title, [[Emma Tillman]], died on 28 January 2007 around 10:10 PM EST, it was already well into 29 January in Japan at that time.

After her husband died, she raised her five children by selling flowers and vegetables at a [[coal mine]].

Minagawa lived alone in the Momochi apartment building in Nishijin, [[Sawara-ku, Fukuoka]], near [[Seinan Gakuin University]], until 2005, when she moved to Keijuen, a special nursing home in her native Akaike. Minagawa enjoyed playing the [[shamisen]]. Even at 114, she participated in club activities in a wheelchair and &amp;quot;danced&amp;quot; along to music.

Minagawa became the oldest living person in Japan when then 114-year-old [[Ura Koyama]] died in April 2005. With the death of 114-year-old American [[Emma Tillman]] on 28 January 2007, Minagawa became the oldest living person in the world. Minagawa was 114 years 25 days at the time.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.japannewsreview.com/society/kyushu/kyushu/20070814page_id=1438 World’s oldest person, Yone Minagawa, dies at 114 – Japan News Review]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

At the time of her ascension, Minagawa was the youngest person to hold this title since [[Carrie C. White]] was the same age on December 13, 1988, or (for those who doubt the authenticity of White&amp;apos;s claim) since [[Jeanne Calment]] was 114 years and 25 days old on March 18, 1989.

Minagawa died on 13 August 2007 at the age of 114 years 221 days. All but one of her children died before her, but she left six grandchildren, twelve great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren. With her death, another 114-year-old, [[Edna Parker]] of the United States, became the oldest living person.
