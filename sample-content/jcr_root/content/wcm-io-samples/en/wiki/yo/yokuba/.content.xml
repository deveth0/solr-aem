        text="&lt;p&gt;{{dablink|This article is for the [[Sokoto]]n town. For the character of the same name, see [[Mother 3#Yokuba]].}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yokuba&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is listed in [[the Nuttall Encyclopaedia]] as the largest town in [[Sokoto]], in the Lower [[Soudan]], with a large trade in [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], and [[indigo plant]]. It states that, at the time of writing, the town had a [[population]] of 150,000.

Sokoto is now a province in [[Nigeria]] but was at one time a much larger [[Monarchy|kingdom]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;see [[Sokoto]] for details&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). In the 19th century both Sokoto and Soudan referred to larger geographic areas than they do today, so it uncertain what, if any, modern town Nuttall was referring to.

Oddly, the eleventh edition of the [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]], published just four years after the Nuttall Encyclopedia (and shortly after the federation of Nigeria), makes no mention of the town and does not show it on its map of the new nation, despite a considerable number of towns being shown in the Sokoto region.
