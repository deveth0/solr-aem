&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;You&amp;apos;re Just in Love&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; is a [[popular music|popular]] [[song]] by [[Irving Berlin]]. It was published in [[1950 in music|1950]] and was first performed by [[Ethel Merman]] and [[Russell Nype]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Call Me Madam]],&amp;apos;&amp;apos; a musical comedy that debuted at the Imperial Theatre in [[New York City]] on October 12 that year. The show ran for 644 performances. Ethel Merman also later starred in the 1953 film version.  Theatre lore has it that Berlin wrote the song one night after Call Me Madam was not doing well in tryouts.  The second act of the show was lacking.  &amp;quot;What I&amp;apos;d like to do is a song with the kid (Russell Nype),&amp;quot; Merman said.  So, Berlin went to his room and later produced the counterpoint song.  When Berlin played the song for Merman, she said, &amp;quot;We&amp;apos;ll never get off the stage.&amp;quot;  According to Berlin&amp;apos;s biographer though, Berlin played the song for Russell Nype first, but admonished him not to admit he did so because it would infuriate Merman.

Several recorded versions made the charts in 1950-51: [[Perry Como]] and [[The Fontane Sisters]] with [[Mitchell Ayres]]&amp;apos; and His Orchestra, [[Rosemary Clooney]] and [[Guy Mitchell]], and [[Ethel Merman]] and [[Dick Haymes]].

The [[Perry Como]]/[[Fontane Sisters]] version was recorded on September 26, 1950 and released by [[RCA Victor Records]] as [[Catalog numbering systems for single records|catalog number]] 20-3945 (in USA)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.78discography.com/RCA203500.htm RCA Victor Records in the 20-3500 to 20-3999 series]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and by [[EMI]] on the [[His Master&amp;apos;s Voice]] label as catalog number B&amp;amp;nbsp;10221. The record first reached the [[Billboard magazine]] charts on December 22, 1950 and lasted 17 weeks on the chart, peaking at #5.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://tsort.info/music/19cb1n.htm Perry Como chart entries]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The [[Rosemary Clooney]]/[[Guy Mitchell]] version was recorded on October 21, 1950 and released by [[Columbia Records]] as catalog number 39052. The record first reached the [[Billboard magazine]] charts on February 23, 1951 and lasted 2 weeks on the chart, peaking at #29.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://tsort.info/music/rwsp4m.htm Guy Mitchell chart entries]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The [[Ethel Merman]]/[[Dick Haymes]] version was recorded on October 17, 1950 and released by [[Decca Records]] as catalog number 27317. The record first reached the [[Billboard magazine]] charts on March 30, 1951 and lasted 1 week on the chart, at #30.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://tsort.info/music/pg54qc.htm Dick Haymes chart entries]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Although the lowest charting of the three, it got a considerable amount of airplay in subsequent years.

[[Semprini]], piano with Rhythm accompaniment recorded it in [[London]] on January 25, 1951 as the first song of the medley &amp;quot;Dancing to the Piano (No. 12) - Part 2. Hit Medley of Foxtrots from &amp;apos;Call Me Madam&amp;apos;&amp;quot; along with &amp;quot;[[The Best Thing for You]]&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;It&amp;apos;s Lovely Day Today.&amp;quot; The medley was released by [[EMI]] on the [[His Master&amp;apos;s Voice]] label as catalog number B&amp;amp;nbsp;10231.

Musically, the song is one of [[Irving Berlin]]&amp;apos;s three well-known songs that use true [[counterpoint]]â€”a main melody with a secondary melody running at the same time, both with independent lyrics - his two other best-known counterpoint songs being [[Play a Simple Melody]] and &amp;quot;[[Old Fashioned Wedding|An Old-Fashioned Wedding]]&amp;quot; (see the 1966 revival of [[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]). Berlin also made brilliant use of counterpoint in &amp;quot;Pack Up Your Sins (And Go To The Devil),&amp;quot; a song composed for the Music Box Revue of 1922.

This song was also covered by [[Chet Atkins]] in 1957, [[Jimmy Clanton]] in 1960, [[Louis Prima]], [[Kay Starr]], [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Louis Armstrong]].  [[Ewan McGregor]]/[[Jane Horrocks]] also covered the song in a 2007 released album of further [[Little Voice (film)|Little Voice]] songs.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;test&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/further-adventures-of-little-voice-jane-horrocks-r842864 Album listing on AllMusic.Com]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
