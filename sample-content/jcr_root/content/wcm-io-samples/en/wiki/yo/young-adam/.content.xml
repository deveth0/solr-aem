&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Young Adam&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[1954 in literature|1954]] novel by [[Alexander Trocchi]] which tells the story of Joe, a young man who labors on the [[barge|river barges]] of [[Glasgow]], and who discovers the body of a young woman floating in the canal. The novel focuses on the relationship between Joe and his companions on the barge&amp;amp;nbsp;– a husband and wife&amp;amp;nbsp;– and it becomes clearer as the novel progresses that Joe is connected to the dead woman he found. From this comes the saying, &amp;quot;I&amp;apos;ve shed my own skin and merged into the fog.&amp;quot;

This story was adapted to [[film]] as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Young Adam (film)|Young Adam]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[2003 in film|2003]].
