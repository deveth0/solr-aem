&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yolanda  Montes &amp;quot;Tongolele&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (b. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yolanda Ivonne Montes Farrington&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, January 3, 1932, [[Spokane, Washington]]) is an [[exotic dancer]] and actress of the [[Cinema of Mexico]]. In Mexico she is considered the principal exotic dancer along KalantÃ¡n, Bongala and [[Su Muy Key]].

Tongolele became a professional dancer when she was only 15 years old. Her father was [[Spain|Spanish]]/[[Sweden|Swedish]], her mother [[France|French]]/[[England|English]] and her maternal grandmother was of [[Tahiti]]an descent.

She starred in several films from the 1940s through the 1980s but most people remember her from the classic 1971 film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Isle of the Snake People]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; starring [[Boris Karloff]] in one of his last roles. Tongolele is still active in television, theatre, and nightclubs.  She is still well known in [[Spain]] and [[Latin America]].
