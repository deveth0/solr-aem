{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yoshio Nishina&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|仁科 芳雄|Nishina Yoshio|extra= December 6, 1890 – January 10, 1951}} was the founding father of modern physics research in Japan. He co-authored the well-known [[Klein–Nishina formula]]. He was a principal investigator of [[RIKEN]] and mentored generations
of physicists, including two Nobel Laureates: [[Hideki Yukawa]] and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]]. During [[World War II]] he was the head of the [[Japanese nuclear weapon program]]. The crater [[Nishina (crater)|Nishina]] on the Moon is named in his honor.

Nishina was born in [[Satoshō, Okayama|Satoshō]], [[Okayama Prefecture|Okayama]] and graduated from [[Tokyo Imperial University]] in 1918. After graduation, he became a staff member at the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (now RIKEN). In 1921 he was sent to Europe for research. He visited some European universities and institutions, including [[Cavendish Laboratory]], [[Georg August University of Göttingen]], and [[University of Copenhagen]]. In [[Copenhagen]] he did research with [[Niels Bohr]] and they became good friends. In 1928 he wrote a paper on incoherent or [[Compton scattering]] with [[Oskar Klein]] in Copenhagen, from which the [[Klein–Nishina formula]] derives.&amp;lt;ref name=r1/&amp;gt;

In 1929 he returned to Japan, where he endeavored to foster an environment for the study of [[quantum mechanics]]. He established Nishina Laboratory at the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research in 1931 and invited some Western scholars to Japan including [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] and [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] to stimulate Japanese physicists. His research was concerned with [[cosmic ray]]s and [[particle accelerator]] development for which he constructed a few [[cyclotron]]s at RIKEN. In particular, he detected what turned out to be the [[muon]] in cosmic rays, independently of Anderson &amp;apos;&amp;apos;et al&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref name=r1/&amp;gt; He also discovered the [[uranium-237]] [[isotope]] and pioneered the studies of [[symmetric fission]] phenomena occurring upon fast neutron irradiation of uranium (1939–1940). His laboratory was severely damaged during World War II and most equipment had to be discarded and rebuilt after the war.&amp;lt;ref name=r2&amp;gt;[http://www.nishina-mf.or.jp/english/NishinaMemorialFoundation2008.pdf Yoshio Nishina – Father of Modern Physics in Japan]. Nishima Foundation&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1946 Nishina was awarded the [[Order of Culture]] by the [[Hirohito|Emperor of Japan]].
Nishima died from liver cancer in 1951.&amp;lt;ref name=r1&amp;gt;Sin-Itiro Tomonaga [http://ptp.ipap.jp/journal/pdf/05-6-preface.pdf Yoshio Nishina, His Sixtieth Birthday], November 20, 1950 (updated January 11, 1951)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
