&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;You Sure Love to Ball&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a song released by American recording artist [[Marvin Gaye]]. Released on January 2, [[1974 in music|1974]], it was the third and final single to be released from Gaye&amp;apos;s acclaimed album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Let&amp;apos;s Get It On]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Song overview==
Unlike most of the material on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Let&amp;apos;s Get It On&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which focused more on [[romance (music)|romance]] music including a brief social plea (&amp;quot;Keep Gettin&amp;apos; It On&amp;quot;), this song focused entirely on the sexual portion of its subject. The song starts off with a rhythm section including guitars, a bass and drums and a saxophone solo. In the middle of the solo, induced moans can be heard from a couple before Gaye finally begins singing the lyrics. The term &amp;quot;ball&amp;quot; was [[sexual slang|slang]] for having sex.{{sfn|Dyson|2004|pp=152-154}}

==Chart performance==
The song was issued as a single on January 2, 1974. Initial radio airplay was good enough for the song to peak at thirteen on the [[Hot R&amp;amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Soul Singles]] chart and fifty on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] but soon peaked out allegedly due to the controversial nature of the track, making the song the least successful of the three tracks released on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Let&amp;apos;s Get It On&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Its b-side included the solemn ballad closer of the album, &amp;quot;[[Just to Keep You Satisfied]]&amp;quot;.

==Covers and samples==
In 1976, singer [[Sylvia Robinson|Sylvia]] covered the song. Singer [[Will Downing]] later covered the song for the Marvin tribute album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Marvin Is 60: A Tribute Album]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as did [[Keith Washington]] on his 1998 album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;KW&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]&amp;apos;s 2001 song, &amp;quot;Twork It Out&amp;quot; from his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[8701]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; album, featured heavy sampling of &amp;quot;You Sure Love to Ball&amp;quot;.
