&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yodheya&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (alias Yaudheya or Yauddheya) was a kingdom that lay close to the [[Kuru Kingdom|kingdom of the Pandavas]]. They have taken part in the [[Kurukshetra War]], siding with the [[Kauravas]]. [[Pandava]] king [[Yudhisthira]] had a son named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yaudheya&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It is not clear if he belonged to the Yaudheya tribe. There is some speculation that the Yaudheyas were linked to the [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri|Yadava]] chief Yuyudhana, otherwise known as [[Satyaki]] and thus were a Yadava tribe, whereas other evidence links them to [[Rajput]]s (See [[Yaudheya]]).
