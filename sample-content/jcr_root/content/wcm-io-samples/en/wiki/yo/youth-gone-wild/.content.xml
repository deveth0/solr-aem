&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Youth Gone Wild&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; is the debut [[single]] from [[Skid Row]]&amp;apos;s [[eponymous]] [[debut]] [[album]].

Its [[music video]] received heavy airplay on [[MTV]]; however, while the album itself was a major hit and went [[multi-platinum]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] and other countries, &amp;quot;Youth Gone Wild&amp;quot; as a single only reached #99 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100]] and reached #20 on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5444/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title = Allmusic (Skid Row charts and awards) Billboard singles|publisher=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The song was re-released in 1992 on the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[B-Side Ourselves]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; album with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Delivering the Goods&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; single and charted again at #22 on the [[UK Singles chart]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=5641|title = Skid Row chart stats|publisher=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The song is played at many sports arenas including at the [[United Center]] when the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] hit the ice.
