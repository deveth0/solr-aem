        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Youth Leagues&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were societies of young people, mainly intellectuals, who wanted independence for [[Sri Lanka]].

The first of these organisations was the [[Jaffna]] Students’ Congress, founded in 1924 and renamed the [[Jaffna Youth Congress]] (JYC) in 1926. It had its base amongst educated middle-class [[Tamil people|Tamil]] youth, especially and young graduates from [[India]]n Universities and from the newly founded  [[University College, Colombo]]. It drew enthusiasm and morale boosts from visits of leading Indian personalities, such as [[Gandhi]] and [[Nehru]].

In 1931 [[Kamaladevi Chattopadyaya]] addressed the opening session of the All-Ceylon Youth Congress, which brought together the Youth Leagues in the All-Ceylon Youth Congress.

A group of young intellectuals who had returned to the island in the early thirties, having completed their studies abroad where they had been influenced by the [[Marxist]] and labour movements, enthusiastically participated in the radical activities of the newly formed Youth Leagues, which became a focus of [[anti-imperialist]] agitation among the youth.

In February 1933 they  became involved in a strike at the Wellawatte Spinning and Weaving mills, the island’s largest [[textile]] factory at that time with 1,400 workers (two-thirds of Indian origin and one-third Sinhalese). This gave the Youth Leaguers a chance for leadership as well as experience in trade union agitation. The South Colombo Youth League published an irregular journal in [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kamkaruwa&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (The Worker).

In November 1933 the Youth League radicals initiated a dynamic revival of the [[Suriya-Mal Movement]]. In opposition to the official [[Poppy Day]] sponsored by the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial administration (which sent the funds it raised to [[United Kingdom|Britain]]) the Youth Leagues sold the local &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Suriya&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Portia tree]]) flower, with the proceeds going to Ceylonese [[ex-servicemen]]. During the malaria epidemic in 1934-5 these activists did relief work in the disease-stricken areas where over 100,000 people died.

The Ministers of the [[Ceylon National Congress]] petitioned the colonial government to increase their powers, instead of demanding full independence, or even [[dominion]] status. They were forced to withdraw their &amp;apos;Ministers&amp;apos; Memorandum&amp;apos; after a vigorous campaign by the Youth Leagues.
