&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yolanda Hughes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a professional [[female bodybuilding|female bodybuilder]] from the [[United States]].

==Biography==

Yolanda was born in [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]] on October 30, 1963. At a height of 5&amp;apos;6Â½&amp;quot;, she competed as a heavyweight as an amateur. She earned her pro card by winning the World Amateur championship in 1992. She spent several years living in Germany, where she met her husband, Thomas Heying. After moving back to the US in the mid-1990s, they settled in Bellingham, Wa., where they still live. As a professional, her greatest success was winning consecutive [[Ms. International]] titles in 1997 and 1998. She competed in six [[Ms. Olympia]] contests, placing second to Kim Chizevsky at the 1998 Ms O, which was held in Prague in the Czech Republic that year (the only time it has been held outside North America).

Yolanda also had a cameo in the 2002 movie &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rollerball&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Recently Hughes opened a special training studio called Fitness Exotica in which she offers training and dance lessons to customers.
