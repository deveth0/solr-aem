        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yotaro Kobayashi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, born April 1933 in [[England]], is former chairman of the [[Fuji Xerox]] company, a joint venture between [[Fujifilm]] (75%) and [[Xerox]] (25%). He serves Pacific Asia chairman of the [[Trilateral Commission]].

He was educated at [[Keio University]] and the [[Wharton School]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], graduating in 1956 and 1958 respectively. His father, [[Setsutaro Kobayashi]], was the third president of Fujifilm and the first president of the Fuji Xerox company. He was Chair of the Board of the [[International University of Japan]], succeeding founder Sohei Nakayama, formerly of the [[Industrial Bank of Japan]].

In September, 2004, Kobayashi, who  is the Chief Japanese Committee Member of the [[First China-Japan Friendship 21st Century Committee]], criticized Japanese prime minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] over his repeated visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which had caused anger in the [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China]] as well as in [[Korea]].  Subsequently, [[Molotov cocktails]] were thrown into the grounds of Kobayashi&amp;apos;s home in [[Meguro, Tokyo]], an act police suspect was carried out by nationalist groups who are hostile to his views.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news
