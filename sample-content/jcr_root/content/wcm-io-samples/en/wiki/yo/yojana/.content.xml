        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yojana&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Sanskrit : योजन ) is a [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] measure of distance used in ancient [[India]]. The exact measurement is disputed amongst scholars with distances being given between 6 to 15 [[kilometer]]s (4 to 9 [[mile]]s).

In modern [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Hindi]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;yojana&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Hindi : योजना ) also means &amp;quot;plan&amp;quot; or blueprint and has an interesting connection with the Cartesian notion of distance. However &amp;quot;Yojana&amp;apos;&amp;quot; (याेजन) and &amp;quot;Yojanaa&amp;quot; (याेजना - meaning &amp;quot;Plan&amp;quot;) are different. They are pronounced differently. Difference is &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;aa&amp;quot; at the end, the second one pronounced &amp;quot;aa&amp;quot; as in arm [ārm].

==Variations on length==
The length of the Yojana varied depending on the different standards adopted by different [[Indian astronomy|Indian
astronomers]]. It was taken to be the distance covered by an ox cart in one day. In the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Surya Siddhanta]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the 5th century, for example, a Yojana was equivalent to 5 miles,&amp;lt;ref name=Thompson&amp;gt;{{citation|title=Planetary Diameters in the Surya-Siddhanta|author=[[Richard Thompson]]|journal=[[Journal of Scientific Exploration]]|volume=11|issue=2|pages=193–200 [196]|year=1997}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and the same was true for [[Aryabhata]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Aryabhatiya]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (499).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Aryabhata_I|title=Aryabhata I}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; By the time of [[Paramesvara]] in the 14th century, the Yojana was more than 1.5 times larger than it was in Aryabhata&amp;apos;s time, thus a Yojana was equivalent to at least 8 miles by Paramesvara&amp;apos;s time.&amp;lt;ref name=Thompson/&amp;gt;

Religious leader [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] gives the equivalent length of a yojana as 8 miles (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;12,8 km&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://vedabase.net/sb/10/57/18/en1 Srimad Bhagavatam 10.57.18 (translation)] &amp;quot;one yojana measures about eight miles&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; throughout his translations of the [[Bhagavata Purana]]. Some traditional Indian scholars give measurements between 13 km and 16 km (8-10 miles) or thereabouts.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Alexander Cunningham, in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Ancient Geography of India&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, takes a yojana to mean 8 miles.

==Usage==
Height of meru parvat is estimated to be 1,00,000 yojan in jain cosmology where 1 yojan is given as 4000 miles.
If the length of a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yojana&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is taken to be approximately 8 to 10 miles (13-16 km), like it was in later times, then its subsidiary measurements are as follows:

*1 angula = 16 mm to 21 mm
*4 angulas = one dhanu graha (bow grip) = 62 mm to 83 mm;
*8 angulas = one dhanu musti (fist with thumb raised) = 125 mm to 167 mm;
*12 angulas = 1 vitasti ([[Span_(unit)|handspan]]: distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched) = 188 mm to 250 mm
*2 vitastis = 1 aratni (cubit) = 375 mm to 500 mm
*4 aratnis = 1 danda = 1.5 to 2.0 m
*2 dandas = 1 dhanu = 3 to 4 m
*5 dhanus = 1 rajju = 15 m to 20 m
*2 rajjus = 1 paridesha = 30 m to 40 m
*100 parideshas = 1 krosha (or gorata) = 3 km to 4 km
*4 kroshas = 1 yojana = 13 km to 16 km
*1,000 yojanas = 1 Mahayojan = 13 Mm to 16 Mm
