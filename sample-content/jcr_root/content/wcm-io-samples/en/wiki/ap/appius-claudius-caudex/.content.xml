        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Appius Claudius Caudex&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (f. 264 BC) was a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] member of the [[Claudius (gens)|Claudii]]. He was the grandson&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Lindsay 1995&amp;quot;&amp;gt; H. Lindsay, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Suetonius: Tiberius&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (London: Bristol Classical Press, 1995), 58.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; of [[Appius Claudius Caecus]] through his father [[Gaius Claudius]], and served as [[consul]] in 264 BC.

In that year, he drew [[Roman Republic|Rome]] into conflict with [[Carthage]] over possession of [[Sicily]]. In 265 BC, [[Hiero II of Syracuse]] had attacked [[Messina, Italy|Messina]] in an attempt to capture it from the [[Mamertines]], mercenaries from [[Campania]] who had taken it some years before. The Mamertines allied with a nearby Carthaginian fleet and held off the [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracusans]], but when the Carthaginians did not leave, the Mamertines appealed to Rome in 264 BC.

Some [[Roman Senate|senators]] were opposed to helping them, but Appius Claudius persuaded the citizens to support them. He led a force to Messina and, as the Mamertines had convinced the Carthaginians to withdraw, he met with only a symbolic resistance. The Mamertines handed the city over to Appius Claudius, but the Carthaginians returned and laid siege to Messana. The Syracusans, meanwhile, were also stationed outside the city. Claudius tried to send ambassadors to both the Carthaginians and the Syracusans, but he was ignored. He then led his troops outside the city, defeated the Syracusans in battle, and Hiero retreated back to Syracuse. The next day Claudius also defeated the Carthaginians. Following these victories Appius laid siege to [[Echetla]] but after the loss of many troops returned to Messana.&amp;lt;ref name=diodorus1&amp;gt;Diodorus Siculus, Biblioteca Historica, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/23*.html#3 23.3]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

This dispute was one of the immediate causes of the [[First Punic War]].

Interestingly enough his name &amp;quot;Caudex&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;blockhead&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;idiot&amp;quot; in Latin.

His brother was [[Publius_Claudius_Pulcher_(consul_249_BC)|Publius Claudius Pulcher]], consul in 249 BC.
