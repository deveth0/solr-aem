&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Apros&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-grc|Ἄπρος}}) was an [[ancient Greek]] city in [[Thrace]], now in modern [[Turkey]]. Its exact location seems to be Kermeyan as mentioned in tr.wikepedia &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kermeyan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; entry, near Rodosto (modern [[Tekirdağ]], Turkey), west of [[Istanbul]].

In the fourth century, Apros was the principal city of the region southwest of [[Perinthus|Heraclea]].

Apros was a metropolitan see of the [[Roman Catholic]] Church from the time of Emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus]] (ruled 1143 - 1180) called Theodosiopolis. Either [[Theodosius I]] or [[Theodosius II]] had attempted to rename Apros to Theodosiopolis, but only the Catholic Church seems to have adopted the name for any length of time.

After the capture of [[Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]] the city of Apros was alternately held by Tsar [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]] and the [[The Crusades|Crusaders]]. The Crusaders referred to Apros as Naples or Napoli. The Crusaders made [[Theodosius Branas]] (who [[Geoffroi de Villehardouin]] refers to as Vemas) the Lord of Apros.

In 1206, Tsar Kaloyan destroyed Apros, but it was later rebuilt and continued to be ruled by Branas. In July 1305, in the [[Battle of Apros]], the [[Catalan Company]] annihilated the Byzantine imperial army under [[Michael IX Palaiologos]].
