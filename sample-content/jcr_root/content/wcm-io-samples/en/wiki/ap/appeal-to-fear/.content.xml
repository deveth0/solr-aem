An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;appeal to fear&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;argumentum ad metum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;!-- or ad metum? yes metum is the correct form in latin--&amp;gt; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;argumentum in terrorem&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[fallacy]] in which a person attempts to create support for an idea by using [[deception]] and [[propaganda]] in attempts to increase fear and prejudice toward a competitor. The appeal to fear is common in [[marketing]] and [[politics]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/fallacies/fallacies_alpha.htm Fallacies: alphabetic list (full list)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Logic==
This fallacy has the following [[argument form]]:

:Either P or Q is true.
:Q is frightening.
:Therefore, P is true.

The argument is invalid. The [[appeal to emotion]] is used in exploiting existing fears to create support for the speaker&amp;apos;s proposal, namely P.  Also, often the [[false dilemma]] fallacy is involved, suggesting Q is the proposed idea&amp;apos;s sole alternative.

==Example==
*&amp;quot;If you continue to drink, you will die early as your father did.&amp;quot;
*&amp;quot;If you cannot graduate from high school, you will live in poverty for the rest of your life.&amp;quot;
*&amp;quot;Voting for him is the same as voting for the terrorists.&amp;quot;
*&amp;quot;If you tell a lie, then no one will ever believe what you say again.&amp;quot; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/fallacies/appeal_fear.htm Changing Minds Appeal to Fear&amp;quot;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
*&amp;quot;If you hold your breath for a long time, you will die&amp;quot;

==Fear, uncertainty and doubt==
[[Fear, uncertainty and doubt]] (FUD) is the appeal to fear in [[sales]] or [[marketing]]; in which a company disseminates negative (and vague) information on a competitor&amp;apos;s product. The term originated to describe misinformation tactics in the [[computer hardware]] industry and has since been used more broadly. FUD is &amp;quot;implicit coercion&amp;quot; by &amp;quot;any kind of [[disinformation]] used as a competitive weapon.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |author=Raymond, Eric S |authorlink=Eric S. Raymond |url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/F/FUD.html |work=The Jargon File |title=FUD}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; FUD creates a situation in which buyers are encouraged to purchase by [[brand recognition|brand]], regardless of the relative technical merits. Opponents of certain large computer corporations{{who|date=November 2011}} state that the spreading of fear, uncertainty, and doubt is an [[unethical]] marketing technique that these corporations consciously employ.

==As persuasion==
Fear appeals are often used in [[marketing]] and [[social policy]], as a method of [[persuasion]]. Fear is an effective tool to change attitudes,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://issuu.com/martijnboermans/docs/boermans_2009_-_thesis_fear_appeals]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; which are moderated by the motivation and ability to process the fear message. Examples of fear appeal include reference to social exclusion, and getting laid-off from one&amp;apos;s job,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;cons&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Solomon. Zaichkowsky, Polegato. Consumer Behaviour Pearson, Toronto. 2005&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; getting cancer from smoking or involvement in car accidents and driving.

Fear appeals are &amp;apos;&amp;apos;nonmonotonic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, meaning that the level of persuasion does not increase in proportion to the amount of fear that is used. A study of public service messages on AIDS found that if the messages were too aggressive or fearful, they were rejected by the subject; a moderate amount of fear is the most effective [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] changer.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;cons&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

Others argue that it is not the level of fear that is decisive changing attitudes via the persuasion process. Rather, as long as a scare-tactics message includes a recommendation to cope with the fear, it can work.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/dissertations/1975035/inhoud.htm]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
