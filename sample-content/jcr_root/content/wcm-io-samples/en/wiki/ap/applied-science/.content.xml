&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Applied science&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a discipline that applies existing scientific knowledge to develop more practical applications, such as technology or inventions.

Within [[natural science]], disciplines that are [[basic science]], also called pure science, develop &amp;apos;&amp;apos;information&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to predict and perhaps explain—thus somehow understand—phenomena in the natural world.  Applied science applies the basic science toward practical endeavors.  Applied science is typically [[engineering]], which develops [[technology]], although there might be feedback between basic science and applied science: [[research and development]] (R&amp;amp;D).

[[Medical sciences]], for instance [[medical microbiology]] and its [[clinical virology]], are applied sciences that apply [[biology]] toward medical knowledge and inventions, but not necessary medical technology, whose development is more specifically [[biomedicine]] or [[biomedical engineering]].  Applied science can also apply [[formal science]], such as [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]], as in [[epidemiology]].  [[Genetic epidemiology]] is an applied science applying both biological and statistical methods.

==In education==
In [[Education in the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom&amp;apos;s educational system]], Applied Science refers to a suite of &amp;quot;vocational&amp;quot; science qualifications that run alongside &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; GCSE or A Level Sciences
.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/applied-science-invisible-revolution Applied Science - an invisible revolution? | Nuffield Foundation&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
Level 2 Courses (GCSE Equivalent): BTEC Applied Science, OCR Nationals, GCSE Applied Science, GCSE Additional Applied Science.
Level 3 Courses (A Level Equivalent): GCE Applied Science, BTEC Applied Science, OCR Nationals.
Applied Science courses generally contain more coursework (also known as portfolio or internally assessed work) compared to their traditional counterparts. These are an evolution of the GNVQ qualifications that were offered up to 2005
These courses regularly come under scrutiny and are due for review following the Wolf Report 2011
&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/DFE-00031-2011 Review of Vocational Education - The Wolf Report : The Department for Education&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
however their merits are argued elsewhere

In the United States, [[The College of William &amp;amp; Mary]] offers an [[Minor (academic)|undergraduate minor]] as well as [[Master of Science]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degrees in &amp;quot;applied science.&amp;quot; Courses and research cover varied fields including [[neuroscience]], [[optics]], [[materials science and engineering]], [[nondestructive testing]], and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.wm.edu/as/appliedscience/ William &amp;amp; Mary - Applied Science&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In New York City, the Bloomberg administration awarded the consortium of Cornell-Technion $100 million in City capital to construct the universities&amp;apos; proposed Applied Sciences campus on Roosevelt Island.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nycedc.com/project/applied-sciences-nyc Applied Sciences NYC | NYCEDC&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
