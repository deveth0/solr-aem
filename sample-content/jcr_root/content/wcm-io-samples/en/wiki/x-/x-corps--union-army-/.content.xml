        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;X Corps&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[corps]] of the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. It served during operations in [[South Carolina]] in the Department of the South, and later in [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]]&amp;apos;s [[Army of the James]], during the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign | Bermuda Hundred]] and [[Petersburg Campaign | Petersburg]] Campaigns.[[Image:Xcorpsbadge1.png|thumb|Union Army 1st Division Badge, X Corps]]

==History==
The corps was officially created on September 13, 1862, to consist of the majority of Union troops operating in South Carolina and eastern Georgia. (Other troops in Florida were officially under its command but were not effectively.) The corps was initially commanded by [[Ormsby M. Mitchel]], who died in October 1862. He was succeeded by [[John Milton Brannan]], [[David Hunter]], [[Quincy Adams Gillmore]], [[David B. Birney]] and [[Alfred H. Terry]].

The corps took part in most of the operations against [[Charleston, South Carolina | Charleston]] from 1862&amp;amp;ndash;63, including attacks on [[James Island (South Carolina)|James Island]] and [[Morris Island]] and the [[Battle of Fort Wagner]]. Other elements of the corps based in Florida took part in the disastrous [[Battle of Olustee]].

In early 1864, the corps, now commanded by Gillmore, was transferred to the [[Army of the James]]. It took part in the Bermuda Hundred operations and played a principal role in the disastrous [[Battle of Proctor&amp;apos;s Creek|Drewry&amp;apos;s Bluff]] action. It also took part in the attack on [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]] in conjunction with units of the [[Army of the Potomac]], and the corps played a major role in the early stages of the [[Petersburg Campaign]].

In December 1864, the corps was disbanded; its white contingent went to the new [[XXIV Corps (ACW)|XXIV Corps]], while its black units went to the [[XXV Corps (ACW)|XXV Corps]]. A detachment of former X Corps troops took part in the successful attack on [[Second Battle of Fort Fisher|Fort Fisher]], North Carolina, in early 1865. The X Corps was &amp;quot;revived&amp;quot;, under the command of [[Alfred Terry]], in March 1865. It was attached to the [[Department of North Carolina]] under Schofield and was part of Sherman&amp;apos;s Army after Bentonville. After Johnston&amp;apos;s surrender, it served primarily on garrison duty in South Carolina and Georgia until it was discontinued in August 1865.
