&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;X-Wars&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[massively multiplayer online game|massively multiplayer]] [[browser game]], in which thousands of players interact in realtime. It contains elements of [[real-time strategy]] and [[construction and management simulation]].

The player colonizes and develops planets, designs, builds and commands starships as well as trades, allies and battles with other players.

The game has become popular in the early stages of massively multiplayer browser games from 2002 in [[Germany]], mainly for its complexity and innovative features. Later it has been released internationally in six languages.

X-Wars won the &amp;quot;Superbrowsergame Gold Award&amp;quot; of 2005 in the category of the largest games (more than 20,000 players).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.gdynamite.de/specials_245.html gdynamite.de] Feb 3, 2005, available online at Dec 28, 2009&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This prize had been the most prominent massively multiplayer browser specific game contest at the time and was awarded after several voting rounds including communities and an expert committee.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.gdynamite.de/specials_122.html gdynamite.de] May 11, 2005, available online at Dec 28, 2009&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The developers were then invited to the [[GIGA Television|Giga Games TV show]] ([[NBC]]).

The popular German mainstream computer magazine [[c&amp;apos;t]] awarded it the best free browsergame.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ct&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[[c&amp;apos;t]] 23/2003, online available at [http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Der-Feind-im-Fenster-289068.html heise.de]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The German gaming magazine PC Action rated it 90%, which has been the best rating.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;PC Action 10/2003, p. 38&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Details ==
The game offers a deep complexity with many fractions, technology dependencies and interaction possibilies which were considered genre innovation at the time of introduction.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ct&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

In particular, the possibility of designing own starship types with own names from a broad range of components contributed to the game&amp;apos;s complexity and popularity and the distinction in comparison to other games. As a result, the X-Wars universe is populated by thousands of different starship types which try to gain strategic advantages in battles.

== History ==
The game has been developed by Sebastian Lagemann and Nils Mitoussis from 2002 and has been published initially in German language. [[Gamigo]] published the game in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]. Later, it was licensed internationally to [[Gameforge]]. [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] versions have been released.
