        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;X. and Church of Scientology v. Sweden&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (7805/77) was a case decided by [[European Commission of Human Rights]] in 1979.

==Facts==

In 1973, the [[Church of Scientology]] of Sweden placed an advertisement for an [[E-meter]] in its periodical. The Consumer Ombudsman, acting upon complaints, requested Market Court an injunction prohibiting the use of certain passages in the advertisement, namely that is was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;an invaluable aid to measuring man&amp;apos;s mental state and changes in it&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The court granted the injunction, and the Church&amp;apos;s petition was rejected by the Supreme Court.

==Decision==

The commission declared the application inadmissible. Concerning Article 9 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention]] ([[freedom of religion]]), it mentioned that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the Market Court did not prevent the Church from selling the E-meter or even advertising it for sale as such&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and stated that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the concept, contained in the first paragraph of Article 9, concerning the manifestation of a belief in practice does not confer protection on statement of purported religious belief which appear as selling &amp;apos;arguments&amp;apos; in advertisements of a purely commercial nature by a religious group&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, therefore founding no interference with Church&amp;apos;s rights.

Concerning Article 10 ([[freedom of expression]]), the Commission found an interference with applicant&amp;apos;s rights. However, it found the interference necessary in a democratic society, stating that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the test of &amp;apos;necessity&amp;apos; in the second paragraph of Article 10 should therefore be a less strict one when applied to restraints imposed on commercial &amp;apos;ideas&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos; (compared with &amp;apos;political&amp;apos; ideas).

The case was also significant, since the Commission recognised in its decision the right of a church to petition on behalf of its members, changing the previous practice.
