&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;X-Out&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[video game]] released by [[Rainbow Arts]] in 1989 for the [[Commodore 64]] and in 1990 for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]].

==Gameplay==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;X-Out&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Shoot &amp;apos;em up#Horizontal scrolling shooter|horizontally scrolling]] [[Shoot &amp;apos;em up|shoot-em-up]] with eight levels and an underwater setting.

Between levels, the player visits a shop and use their game score to purchase new submarines and equipment. The submarines come in four different variants, and additional purchases act as additional &amp;quot;lives&amp;quot;. Each can be equipped with a one-way, two-way or three-way fire weapon of increasing power (and thus cost). Secondary weapons include sonic waves, powershots and target-seeking missiles. The player can also purchase auxiliary satellites and specify their movement pattern, which can be circular orbits, vertical and horizontal movements, or an intercepting action.

==Critical reception==
The ZX Spectrum version achieved good critical success. [[Your Sinclair]] awarded 84%, highlighting the comprehensive shop sequence and large, well-animated enemies. Criticisms included the monochrome graphics which were said to be a little confusing, and the lack of a sense of danger.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;YS&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal|journal=Your Sinclair|author=Bielby, Matt|issue=51|page=56|month=March|year=1990|title=X-Out review}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

During the time of release, there was some debate as to whether the game was actually pronounced &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;cross out&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;X out&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;ex out&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;YS&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; However the cassette version of the Commodore 64 release displays &amp;quot;Loading Crossout&amp;quot; at the beginning of the loading process. Also, in the Amiga version (as well in the C64 version), the synthesized voice in the intro says &amp;quot;Get ready for Crossout&amp;quot;. The sequel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Z-Out]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; abandons this pronunciation pattern.
