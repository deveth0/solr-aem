&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;X-ray scattering techniques&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are a family of non-destructive analytical [[scientific technique|techniques]] which reveal information about the [[crystal structure]], chemical composition, and physical properties of materials and thin films. These techniques are based on observing the [[scattering|scattered]] [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] of an [[X-ray]] beam hitting a sample as a function of incident and scattered angle, polarization, and wavelength or energy. Note that X-ray scattering is different from X-ray [[diffraction]], which is widely used for [[X-ray crystallography]].

==Scattering techniques==
===Elastic scattering===
Materials that do not have long range order may also be studied by scattering methods that rely on [[elastic collision|elastic]] scattering of monochromatic X-rays.
* [[Small-angle X-ray scattering]] (SAXS) probes structure in the nanometer to micrometer range by measuring scattering intensity at scattering angles 2θ close to 0°.
* [[X-ray reflectivity]] is an analytical technique for determining thickness, roughness, and density of single layer and multilayer thin films.
* [[Wide-angle X-ray scattering]] (WAXS), a technique concentrating on scattering angles 2θ larger than 5°.

===Inelastic scattering===
When the energy and angle of the [[inelastic collision|inelastically]] scattered X-rays are monitored, scattering techniques can be used to probe the [[electronic band structure]] of materials.  Inelastic scattering alters the phase of the diffracted x-rays, and as a result do not produce useful data for x-ray diffraction.  Rather, inelastically scattered x-rays contribute to the background noise in a diffraction pattern.

* [[Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering]] (RIXS)
* [[X-ray Raman scattering]]
