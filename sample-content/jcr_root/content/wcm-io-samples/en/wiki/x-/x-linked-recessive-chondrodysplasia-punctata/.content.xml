&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;X-linked recessive chondrodysplasia punctata&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a type of [[chondrodysplasia punctata]] that can involve the skin, hair, and cause short stature with skeletal abnormalities, cataracts, and deafness.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Fitz2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Freedberg, et al. (2003). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fitzpatrick&amp;apos;s Dermatology in General Medicine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. ISBN 0-07-138076-0.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;{{rp|500}}

It causes maxillary hypoplasia (flat nose / affected nasal bridge), stippling shown on x-ray on bones and cartlidge, and shorter ends of the finger tips or toes.

==Aetiology==

The only known cause of this condition is a mutation in the X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1 (CDPX1) gene. Mutations in this gene result in a deficiency of [[arylsulfatase E]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;pmid18348268&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal |author=Nino M, Matos-Miranda C, Maeda M, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;et al.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; |title=Clinical and molecular analysis of arylsulfatase E in patients with brachytelephalangic chondrodysplasia punctata |journal=Am. J. Med. Genet. A |volume=146A |issue=8 |pages=997â€“1008 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18348268 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.32159}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Only 50-60% of cases have been shown to have mutations in this gene and the cause of the remaining cases is not yet known.

The CDPX1 gene is located on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp22.3) on the Crick (minus) strand. It is 33,614 bases in length.

The mature protein has a molecular weight of 68 kiloDaltons. It is glycosylated and is located in the [[Golgi apparatus]]. Its activity may be inhibited by [[warfarin]].&amp;lt;ref name=Franco1995&amp;gt;Franco B, Meroni G, Parenti G, Levilliers J, Bernard L, Gebbia M, Cox L, Maroteaux P, Sheffield L, Rappold GA, Andria G, Petit C, Ballabio A (1995) A cluster of sulfatase genes on Xp22.3: mutations in chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX) and implications for warfarin embryopathy. Cell 81(1):15-25&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It seems likely that warfarin induced embryotoxicity may be due at least in part to this inhibition.

==Diagnosis==

This condition occurs almost exclusively in males. The mutation may be spontaneous or inherited from the mother. The typical clinical features are:

*flat nasal tip
*short columella
*maxillary hypoplasia
*involvement of terminal phalanges
*stippled chondrodystrophy

===Biochemical confirmation===

The activity of arylsulfatase E can be measured with the substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate.
