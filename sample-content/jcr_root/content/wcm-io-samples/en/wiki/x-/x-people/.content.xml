&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The X-People&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are a fictional [[comic book]] [[superhero]] team in the [[Marvel Universe]]. They exist in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, an alternate future timeline of the main Marvel continuity. The team has appeared in the MC2 series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[J2 (comics)|J2]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Spider-Girl]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. They are their future&amp;apos;s incarnation of the [[X-Men]].

==Fictional team biography==
The X-People were formed by [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], who was a former member of the X-Men, [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Due to the decrease in anti-[[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] sentiment (caused by the sacrifice of the X-Men to save the Earth), the now more mature and experienced Jubilee decided to start a new version of the X-Men (her &amp;quot;X-People&amp;quot;) and began taking on mutant heroes for training. Some of her first students were not very dedicated (such as the speedster [[Bluestreak (comics)|Bluestreak]], who left due to the lack of publicity the X-People garnered). However, Jubilee found four exceptional heroes (the high flying [[Angry Eagle]], the ape-like [[Simian (comics)|Simian]], the stretchable [[Spanner (comics)|Spanner]], and the superfast [[Torque (Marvel Comics)|Torque]]) to form her core team.

Like her mentor, [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], Jubilee sought out mutants in trouble as well, such as [[Nancy Lu]], a mutant who was being harassed by anti-mutant vandals. The X-People continue to carry out the heroic ideals set by the X-Men.

==Members==
;Jubilee (Jubilation Lee): Team leader of the X-People, has the power to fire blasts of pyrotechnic [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].
;Angry Eagle (Austin Whitlock): [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] youth with large bird-like wings on his back that allow him to fly. Angry Eagle carries stun-daggers, which he can throw with superb accuracy.
;Simian (Otto Jaynston): [[Australia]]n teenager with [[gorilla]]-like strength and agility.
;Torque (Matt Irvin): Moody, arrogant teen with superhuman speed and reflexes. He can spin so fast that he creates a miniature [[tornado]] around himself.
;Spanner (Alyssa Reid): A beautiful blonde with the ability to stretch her body like [[Mister Fantastic]].
;[[Push (Marvel Comics)|Push]] (Nancy Lu): A [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]]; formerly a classmate of May Parker ([[Spider-Girl]]), Lu was forced out of her town by anti-mutant protestors.

===Former and honorary members===
;[[Bluestreak (comics)|Bluestreak]] (Blue Kelso): Super speedster who left the team for more fame and recognition as a member of [[A-Next]].
;[[J2 (comics)|J2]] (Zane Yama): Son of the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], he was given honorary status after he saved the team from the mind control of the villainess Enthralla.
;[[Wild Thing (comics)|Wild Thing]] (Rina Logan): Daughter of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]. Wild Thing was made an honorary member after she defeated the entire team in a practice session.
