&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Krystyna M. Kuperberg&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Krystyna M. Trybulec&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; 17 July 1944) is a Polish-American [[mathematician]] who currently works at [[Auburn University]].

Her parents, Jan W. and Barbara H. Trybulec, were [[pharmacist]]s and owned a pharmacy in [[Tarnów]].  Her older brother is [[Andrzej Trybulec]].  Her husband [[Włodzimierz Kuperberg]] and her son [[Greg Kuperberg]] are also mathematicians, while her daughter Anna Kuperberg is a photographer.

After attending high school in [[Gdańsk]], she entered the [[University of Warsaw]] in 1962, where she studied  mathematics.  Her first mathematics course was taught by [[Andrzej Mostowski]]; later she attended [[topology]] lectures of [[Karol Borsuk]] and became fascinated by topology.

After obtaining her undergraduate degree, Kuperberg began graduate studies at Warsaw under Borsuk. For many years she worked primarily in topology, with some interest in [[Euclidean geometry]].  She left Poland in 1969 with her family to live in [[Sweden]], then moved to the United States in 1972.

In 1987 she solved a problem of [[Bronisław Knaster|Knaster]] concerning bi-homogeneity of [[Continuum (topology)|continua]]. In the 1980s she became interested in fixed points and topological aspects of [[dynamical system]]s. In 1993, she constructed a smooth counterexample to the [[Seifert conjecture]].  She has since continued to work in dynamical systems.

In 1995 Kuperberg received the [[Alfred Jurzykowski Award]] from the [[Kościuszko Foundation]]. Her major lectures include an [[American Mathematical Society|AMS]] Plenary Lecture in March 1995, an [[Mathematical Association of America|MAA]] Plenary Lecture in January 1996, and an [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] invited talk in 1998. In 2012 she became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-01-27.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
