The {{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;battle of Mimasetōge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|三増峠の戦い}} took place in 1569, as the forces of [[Takeda Shingen]] withdrew from repeated failed sieges of the [[Late Hōjō clan|Hōjō clan]]&amp;apos;s [[Odawara Castle]] in the [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] of [[Japan]]. The Hōjō forces, led by the brothers [[Hōjō Ujiteru|Ujiteru]] and [[Hōjō Ujikuni|Ujikuni]], lay in wait for him in the pass of Mimase. The Takeda vanguard, which included [[Baba Nobuharu]], was hard-pressed; Shingen himself led up the Takeda main body. The battle turned in favor of the Takeda when [[Yamagata Masakage]] launched a furious counterattack, inflicting heavy casualties on the Hôjô. The Hôjô were defeated and forced to retreat north, allowing the Takeda to return to Kai - though leaving behind some 900 dead.
