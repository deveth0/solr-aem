&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ballsbridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ball&amp;apos;s Bridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{irish place name|Droichead na Dothra|[[River Dodder|Dodder]] bridge}}) is a bridge in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Situated in &amp;quot;Pembroke&amp;quot; which spans the [[River Dodder]] on the south side of the city, it is a three-arch stone bridge and was built in 1791.

Pembroke is an exclusive and very affluent area and is known to contain very expensive property. However, this name is little known and the area is instead more commonly known as Ballsbridge, named after the bridge in the area. The sign on the bridge still proclaims it as &amp;quot;Ball&amp;apos;s Bridge&amp;quot; in recognition of the fact that the original bridge in this location was built and owned by a Mr. Ball.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstalk.ie/podcasts/library/hidden/hd2410a.mp3|title=Dublin historian Pat Lidddy on &amp;quot;Hidden Dublin&amp;quot; series|work=Newstalk 106}} (mp3 file)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Ballsbridge was once part of the [[Pembroke Township]].

==Buildings and structures==
The bridge itself forms the centre of the Ballsbridge suburb which extends northwards towards the Grand Canal along Northumberland Road up to Haddington Road and Shelbourne Road, extends southwards along the [[Merrion Road]] towards [[Merrion]] and along [[Anglesea Road]] towards [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook]], and westwards to encompass the area around [[Pembroke Road]], [[Clyde Road (Dublin)|Clyde Road]], [[Elgin Road]], and [[Herbert Park]]. The park also forms part of Ballsbridge&amp;apos;s nebulous border with [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook]].

The [[Royal Dublin Society|RDS]] has its grounds here, and the [[Lansdowne Road]] headquarters of the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]] (IRFU) is on the boundary between Ballsbridge and [[Irishtown, Dublin|Irishtown]]. The corporate headquarters of [[Allied Irish Banks]] (AIB) are also located in Ballsbridge.

Ailesbury Road, along with adjacent [[Shrewsbury Road]] comprise the blue (most expensive) properties in the [[Dublin]] edition of the board-game &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Shrewsbury Road was the sixth most expensive street in the world in 2007.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Clark|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/05/dublin-housing-market-crisis-bailout|title=The roof falls in on Ireland&amp;apos;s Millionaires Row|newspaper=The Observer|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=5 December 2010|accessdate=5 December 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The bulk of Dublin&amp;apos;s embassies and many diplomatic residences are located in the southern part of Ballsbridge on and around [[Ailesbury Road]]. The British, American, Spanish, Dutch and [[Israel]]i embassies are all located in the Ballsbridge area of Dublin.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0821/viable-explosive-made-safe-in-tallaght-dublin.html|title=Four call outs for Army Bomb Disposal Team|work=RTÉ News|publisher=RTÉ|date=21 August 2012|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Transport==
The [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]] train passes nearby, stopping at [[Lansdowne Road railway station|Lansdowne Road]] and [[Sandymount railway station|Sandymount stations]].
