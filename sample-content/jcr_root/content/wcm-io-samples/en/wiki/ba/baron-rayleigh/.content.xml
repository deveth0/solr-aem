&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Rayleigh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Terling Place in the County of Essex, is a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created in 1821 for [[Charlotte Strutt, 1st Baroness Rayleigh|Lady Charlotte Strutt]], wife of Colonel [[Joseph Strutt (MP)|Joseph Strutt]], [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Maldon (UK Parliament constituency)|Maldon]] and a member of an Essex family that had made its fortune in the milling business. Joseph Strutt had earlier declined the offer of a peerage, and instead proposed that the honour be given to his wife. Lady Rayleigh was the daughter of [[James FitzGerald, 1st Duke of Leinster]], and his wife [[Emily FitzGerald, Duchess of Leinster|Lady Emily Lennox]], the second of the famous Lennox sisters. Her elder brother was [[Charles FitzGerald, 1st Baron Lecale]] and her younger brother was [[Lord Edward FitzGerald]]. Lady Rayleigh&amp;apos;s grandson, the third Baron, was a noted physicist and [[Nobel Prize]] recipient. The latter&amp;apos;s son, the fourth Baron, was also a well-known physicist. {{As of|2010}} the title is held by the fourth Baron&amp;apos;s grandson, the sixth Baron, who succeeded his uncle in 1988.

The family seat is [[Terling Place]] in [[Terling]], [[Essex]].
