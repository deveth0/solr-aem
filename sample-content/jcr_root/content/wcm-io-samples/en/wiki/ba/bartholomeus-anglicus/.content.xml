        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bartholomeus Anglicus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bartholomew of England&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (born before 1203–died 1272)&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ReferenceA&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Bartholomaeus Anglicus&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was an early 13th-century [[scholasticism|scholastic]] scholar of Paris, a member of the [[Franciscan]] order. He was the author of the compendium &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De proprietatibus rerum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;On the Properties of Things&amp;quot;), dated at 1240, an early forerunner of the [[encyclopedia]]. Anglicus also held senior positions within the church and was appointed [[Bishop]] of [[Łuków]] although he wasn&amp;apos;t consecrated to that position.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ReferenceB&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;Bartholomaeus Anglicus&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Early life==

Little is known of his early life. Anglicus is believed to have been born around the turn of the 13th century, to unknown parents. The first record of him was in 1224 in Paris as a teacher, although he is believed to have studied at [[Oxford University]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ReferenceB&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Encyclopedia==

The work &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De proprietatibus rerum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was written at the school of [[Magdeburg]] in [[Saxonia]] and intended for the use of students and the general public.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ReferenceA&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; Bartholomew carefully notes the sources for the material included, although, at present, it is sometimes impossible to identify or locate some of them. His annotations give a good idea of the wide variety of works available to a medieval scholar.

The original Latin work was translated into French in 1372 and a number of manuscripts of the Latin and French versions survive. The work was later printed in numerous editions.

The work was organized in 19 books. The subjects of the books, in order, are [[God]], [[angel]]s (including [[demon]]s), the human [[mind]] or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], [[physiology]], of ages (family and domestic life), [[medicine]], the universe and celestial bodies, time, form and matter ([[classical element|element]]s), [[Earth&amp;apos;s atmosphere|air]] and its forms, water and its forms, earth and its forms including [[geography]], [[gemstone|gems]], [[mineral]]s and metals, animals, and color, odor, taste and liquids.

==Church positions==

He was elected as Minister of [[Austria]] in 1247 and was then elected as Minister of [[Bohemia]] in 1255. This appointment included  [[Poland]] where he resolved a dispute between Duke Boleslaw and the Cathedral Chapter at [[Kraków]]. [[Pope Alexander IV]] appointed him as [[Papal legate]] north of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] in 1256 and appointed him as the Bishop of Łuków. However, he was probably not consecrated in that position due to the [[Mongol]] invasion of Poland in 1259. Anglicus was appointed as Minister at [[Saxonia]] in 1262 and served in that position until his death in 1272.

He was at some point confused with [[Bartholomeus de Glanvilla]], another Franciscan monk who lived a century later.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Bartholomaeus Anglicus}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
