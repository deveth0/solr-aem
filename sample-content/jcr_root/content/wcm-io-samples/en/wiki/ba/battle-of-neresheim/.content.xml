The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Battle of Neresheim&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was fought on 11 August 1796 and resulted the victory of French under General Moreau against Austrians under Archduke Charles.

The Austrians had originally planned to draw Moreau&amp;apos;s eastwards into a trap, where they would surrounded and overwhelmed . However, because of poor coordination and disagreement between the Austrian commanders, only a small force of Austrians were in position to engage the French when they arrived. The defeat forced the Austrians to withdraw further into [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]].
