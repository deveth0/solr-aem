&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Barron Field (Camp Taliaferro Field #3)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a former [[World War I]] military airfield, located {{convert|1.0|mi|km}} West-southwest of [[Everman, Texas]].  It operated as a training field for the [[Air Service, United States Army]] between 1917 until 1921.  It was one of thirty-two Air Service training camps established after the United States entry into [[World War I]] in April 1917. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;William R. Evinger: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Directory of Military Bases in the U.S.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Oryx Press, Phoenix, Ariz., 1991, p. 147.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

After the United States&amp;apos; entry into World War I in April 1917, General John J. &amp;quot;Blackjack&amp;quot; Pershing invited the British Royal Flying Corps to establish training fields in Texas for the training of American and Canadians volunteers because of its mild weather. After looking at sites in Dallas, Fort Worth, Waco, Austin, Wichita Falls and Midland, three sites were established in 1917 in the Fort Worth vicinity (known as the &amp;quot;Flying Triangle.&amp;quot;), those being [[Hicks Field]] (#1), [[Benbrook Field]] (#2), and Barron Field (#3).

Canadians named the training complex &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Camp Taliaferro]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; after Walter Taliaferro, a US aviator who had been killed in an accident.  Camp Taliaferro was headquartered under the direction of the Air Service, United States Army,  which had and administration center near what is now the Will Rodgers Memorial Center in Fort Worth, Texas.

==History==
Construction on Taliaferro Field #3 began in September 1917, with the first trainees arriving in November to a very crude facility. Most structures were unfinished and personnel lived and worked in canvas tents. It was taken over by the United States Army in February 1918 and renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Barron Field&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in May for Cadet Robert J. Barron, on 1 May 1918 who was killed at another flying school.

The [[Curtiss JN-4]] &amp;quot;Jenny&amp;quot; became  the primary aircraft used for flight training after the Army takeover.  Eventually, the base expanded to 600 acres, housing as many as 150 officers and 900 enlisted men. Barron Field saw flight training and daredevil stunting by the likes of [[Ormer Locklear]], and other pioneer [[barnstorming]] pilots, sending six squadrons of pilots to France before the war ended in November 1918.

After the war ended, the base was used as an Army storage depot.  Military use ended in 1921, and the facility was eventually dismantled and returned to farmland.  Over the years, the southern suburbs of Fort Worth have expanded over the area, the airfield now is indistinguishable from the urbanized area.   Barron Field was located south of Everman Parkway and west of Oak Grove Road.  One small building, used for munitions, has survived, and today a Texas historical marker is located at the site on the west side of Oak Grove Road.
