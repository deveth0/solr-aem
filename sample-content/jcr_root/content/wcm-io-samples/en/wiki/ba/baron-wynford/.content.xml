&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Wynford&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Wynford Eagle in the County of Dorset, is a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created in 1829 for the politician and lawyer [[William Best, 1st Baron Wynford|Sir William Best]]. He served as [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]] from 1824 to 1829. His eldest son, the second Baron, represented [[Mitchell (UK Parliament constituency)|Mitchell]] (also known as St Michael&amp;apos;s) in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] from 1831 to 1832, when the constituency was abolished. On the death of his younger son, the fourth Baron, this line of the family failed. The late Baron was succeeded by his first cousin, the fifth Baron. He was the son of Reverend the Hon. Samuel Best, third son of the first Baron. {{As of|2010}} the title is held by his great-grandson, the ninth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2002.
