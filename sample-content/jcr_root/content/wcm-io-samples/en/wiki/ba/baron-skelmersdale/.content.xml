        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Skelmersdale&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of [[Skelmersdale]] in the County Palatine of Lancaster, is a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]].

==History==
The title was created in 1828 for the former [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Westbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Westbury]], [[Newcastle-under-Lyme (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle-under-Lyme]], [[Clitheroe (UK Parliament constituency)|Clitheroe]] and [[Dover (UK Parliament constituency)|Dover]], [[Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Baron Skelmersdale|Edward Bootle-Wilbraham]]. His grandson, the second Baron (the son of the Hon. [[Richard Bootle-Wilbraham]]), was a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician and served in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory]] administrations of [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] and [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. In 1880 he was created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earl of Lathom&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in the County Palatine of Lancaster, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. However, the earldom became extinct on the death of his grandson, the third Earl, in 1930. The barony passed to the late Earl&amp;apos;s second cousin, the fifth Baron. He was the grandson of a younger son of the first Baron. On his death the title was inherited by his cousin, the sixth Baron. {{As of|2010}} the title is held by the latter&amp;apos;s son, the seventh Baron, who succeeded on his father&amp;apos;s death in 1973. He served in junior ministerial positions in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] administrations of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Lord Skelmersdale is still a member of the [[British House of Lords|House of Lords]] as one of the ninety-two elected [[hereditary peer]]s allowed to remain after the passing of the [[House of Lords Act 1999|House of Lords Act]] of 1999.
