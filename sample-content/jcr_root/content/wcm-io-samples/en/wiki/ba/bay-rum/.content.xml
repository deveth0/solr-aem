It is a [[distillate]] that was originally made in [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]] &amp;quot;and probably other [[Caribbean|West Indian islands]]&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;John M. Maisch (Philadelphia), &amp;quot;On the Origin of Bay Rum&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;American Journal of Pharmacy&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;33&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1861:289).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; from [[rum]] and the leaves and/or berries of the West Indian bay tree, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pimenta racemosa]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Maisch identified the leaf in the herbarium at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, collected in [[St Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|St Croix]], &amp;quot;by the late Dr, Griffith&amp;quot;, which was identified as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Myrcia|Myrcia acris]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, now transferred to the genus &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pimenta (genus)|Pimenta]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; Maisch added &amp;quot;But it is very probable that various species are made use of for the same purpose.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Other ingredients may be [[citrus]] and [[spice]] oils, the most common being [[Lime (fruit)|lime oil]], [[oil of cloves]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;A drop of oil of cloves is added to two parts bay oil and one part pimento oil in one of two recipes for bay rum in &amp;quot;Practical notes and formulÃ¦&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Chemist &amp;amp; Druggist&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;34&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (27 April 1889:576); the aromatics are steeped in alcohol and as a last step an equal part of &amp;quot;good rum&amp;quot; is added.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and [[cinnamon]]. It was first made fashionable in [[New York City|New York]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Alice M. Coats, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Garden Shrubs and their Histories&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1964) 1992, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;s.v.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Laurus&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and other American cities before it was available in Europe.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;That it is little known in Europe may also be judged from the fact that it is not even mentioned in Piesse&amp;apos;s Art of Perfumery&amp;quot; (Maisch 1861); George William Septimus Piesse, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Art of Perfumery&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1857)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;A recipe for bay rum from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy was included in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Pharmaceutical Journal&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain) 23 February 1878:679&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Proprietary bay rum lotions are produced by labs in several West Indian republics, as well as American and European fragrance companies.

The [[bay laurel]], the &amp;quot;bay leaves&amp;quot; in common culinary use, are from a completely unrelated species, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Laurus nobilis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and not the West Indian bay tree. Bay laurel can be used to produce a similar, although not identical, product.
