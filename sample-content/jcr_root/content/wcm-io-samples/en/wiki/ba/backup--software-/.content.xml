&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Backup&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[backup]] utility made by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] for [[Mac OS X]]. It is available through Apple&amp;apos;s [[MobileMe]] (formerly [[.Mac]]) collection of [[Internet]] services. Backup can be used in connection with either a user&amp;apos;s online MobileMe [[iDisk]] or the [[Macintosh]]&amp;apos;s [[CD-RW]] or [[DVD-R]] drive to make safe, archival copies of critical files and folders.

==Versions==
===Backup 2===
The initial versions of Backup were regarded as feature-sparse and frequently unstable. However, on November 5, 2003 Apple released Backup 2.0, which added new features and offered greater reliability than its predecessors.

While Backup 2 allowed for the creation of archive copies of important data, overall it only had a basic feature set for [[backup software]].

===Backup 3===
Apple introduced Backup 3 at the Paris Expo on September 20, 2005 along with other upgrades to .Mac. This version offered more backup settings, such as the ability to back up your mail database.

==Time Machine==
At the 2006 [[Worldwide Developers Conference]], Apple announced the development of [[Time Machine (Apple software)|Time Machine]], a new backup application which is included in [[Mac OS X v10.5]] &amp;quot;Leopard&amp;quot;.

Time Machine is a complete backup solution, thus it has the ability to completely replace Backup as a general backup solution for most Mac users.

==MobileMe==
When [[MobileMe]] was released on July 11, 2008, [[.Mac]] was discontinued. Backup continued to be available to MobileMe users. The software was re-branded MobileMe Backup with the version 3.2 release..
