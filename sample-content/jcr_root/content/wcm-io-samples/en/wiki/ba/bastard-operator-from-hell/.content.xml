The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bastard Operator From Hell&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;BOFH&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), a [[fictional character]] created by [[Simon Travaglia]], is a rogue [[system administrator]] who takes out his anger on [[user (computing)|user]]s (often referred to as [[luser]]s), colleagues, bosses, and anyone else who pesters him with their pitiful user created &amp;quot;problems&amp;quot;.

The BOFH stories were originally posted in 1992 to [[Usenet]] by Travaglia, with some being reprinted in [[Datamation]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web

}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; They were published weekly from 1995 to 1999 in [[Network Week]] and since 2000 they have been published most weeks in [[The Register]].  They were also published in [[PC Plus]] magazine for a short time, and several books of the stories have also been released.

By extension, the term is also used to refer to any [[system administrator]] who displays (or wishes he could get away with) the qualities of the original.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|first=Eric S.|last=Raymond |title=The new hacker&amp;apos;s dictionary|isbn=978-0-262-68092-9|year=1996|publisher=The MIT Press|page=80}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The term has become common [[Internet slang]].

In the stories, the PFY (Pimply-Faced Youth) is the BOFH&amp;apos;s assistant; this too has become a general term for a junior or trainee system administrator.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=PFY|title=Urban Dictionary: PFY}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Early BOFH editions took place in a university, moving on to an office workplace over time (an exact transition is not given). BOFH 2k began with the BOFH and PFY moving to a new company.
