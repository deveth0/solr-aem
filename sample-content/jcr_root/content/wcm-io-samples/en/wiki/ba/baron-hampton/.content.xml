&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Hampton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of [[Hampton Lovett]] and of [[Westwood House, Worcestershire|Westwood]] in the [[Worcestershire|County of Worcester]], is a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created in 1874 for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[John Pakington, 1st Baron Hampton|Sir John Pakington, 1st Baronet]]. He had previously represented [[Droitwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Droitwich]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] served as [[Secretary of State for War]] and as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]. Pakington had already been created a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baronet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1846. Born John Somerset Russell, he had assumed by Royal license the surname of Pakington in lieu of Russell in 1830 on inherited the estates of his maternal uncle Sir John Pakington, 8th and last Baronet, of Ailesbury.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baronet. On his death in 1893 the title passed to his half-brother, the third Baron. The title then descended to his second but eldest surviving son, the fourth Baron, and then to the latter&amp;apos;s younger brother, the fifth Baron. The fifth Baron&amp;apos;s son, the sixth Baron, sat as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] member of the [[House of Lords]] and was the party&amp;apos;s Spokesman on [[Northern Ireland]] in the House of Lords from 1977 to 1987. {{As of|2010}} the titles are held by his son, the seventh Baron, who succeeded in 2003.

As of 30 June 2006 {{update inline|date=January 2013}}, the present holder of the barony has not successfully proven his succession to the baronetcy and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage. However, the case is under review by the Registrar of the Baronetage (for more information follow this [http://www.baronetage.org/succession-to-baronetcy/ link]).
