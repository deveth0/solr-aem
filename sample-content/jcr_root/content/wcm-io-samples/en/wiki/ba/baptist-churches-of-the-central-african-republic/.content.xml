The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baptist Churches of the Central African Republic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Églises Baptistes de la RCA&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an organization serving the [[Baptist]] churches in the [[Central African Republic]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Equatorial Africa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The General Council of Cooperating Baptists of North America, Inc.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was organized on October 15, 1920 in [[Elyria, Ohio]], under the leadership of Reverend William C. Haas. This independent mission agency sent six missionaries to [[French Equatorial Africa]] in the fall of 1920. Rev. Haas, Mr. and Mrs. Fred Rosenau, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Young, and Mrs. Rowena Becker reached [[Africa]] in January 1921 and journeyed inland to French Equatorial Africa. The first stations were established at Sibut, Crampel, and Bangassou, in what is now the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Central African Republic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Although Hass died in 1924, the mission continued to expand and by the 1960s had grown to over 100 churches. The [[Bible#Christian Bibles|Scriptures]] were translated into the native [[Sango language]], and a hospital, six dispensaries, two Bible schools, and a seminary were established by 1961. In 1960, both [[Chad]] and the Republic of Central Africa became independent states. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baptist Mid-Missions&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the name adopted by the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;General Council of Cooperating Baptists of North America&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1953) separated the two fields of labor, and the current association of Baptist churches was formed in 1963 with 191 churches.

Internal problems caused the dissolution of the association for a period of time in the 1970s. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eglises Baptistes de la RCA&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has also suffered two [[Schism (religion)|schisms]], resulting in the [[Fraternal Union of Baptist Churches]] (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Union Fraternelle des Églises Baptistes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, org. 1977) and the [[Association of Central African Baptist Churches]] (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Association des Églises Baptistes Centrafricaines&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). Another Baptist group, the [[Baptist Churches of Western RCA]], began from mission work of the Swedish Örebro Society in 1923. [[Protestantism]] (25%), [[Catholicism]] (16%), [[Islam]] (14%), and [[Animism]] (24%) provide a pluralistic religious makeup of the country.

In 1995 the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eglises Baptistes de la RCA&amp;apos;&amp;apos; had 375 churches with about 60,000 members. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baptist Mid-Missions&amp;apos;&amp;apos; still has a number of missionaries in the Republic of Central Africa.
