        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bart Howard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (June 1, 1915 â€“ February 21, 2004), born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Howard Joseph Gustafson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was the [[composer]] and writer of the famous [[jazz standard]] &amp;quot;[[Fly Me To The Moon]]&amp;quot;, which has been  performed by singers (among others)[[Bobby Womack]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Nancy Wilson (singer)|Nancy Wilson]], [[Della Reese]], [[Diana Krall]], [[June Christy]] and [[Astrud Gilberto]]. It is also played frequently by [[jazz]] and popular musicians around the world.

Howard was born in [[Burlington, Iowa]]. He began his career as an accompanist at the age of 16 and played for [[Mabel Mercer]], [[Johnny Mathis]] and [[Eartha Kitt]], among others.

&amp;quot;Fly Me To the Moon&amp;quot; was first sung in 1954 by [[Felicia Sanders]] at the &amp;quot;Blue Angel&amp;quot; club in Manhattan where the composer became M.C. and accompanist in 1951. The song received wide exposure when [[Peggy Lee]] sang it on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; several years later. Bart Howard &amp;quot;lived off&amp;quot; this song for the rest of his life, although he had 49 other songs to his credit.  These include &amp;quot;Let Me Love You&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;On The First Warm Day&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;One Love Affair&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Be My All&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Man In The Looking Glass&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;My Love Is A Wanderer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Who Wants To Fall In Love&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Don&amp;apos;t Dream of Anybody But Me&amp;quot;.

He died, aged 88, in [[Carmel, New York]]. He was survived by a sister Dorothy Lind of Burlington, Iowa and by his companion of 58 years, Thomas Fowler.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.jazzhouse.org/gone/lastpost2.php3?edit=1078245748 Todd S. Jenkins (2004)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Notes==
{{reflist}}
The original title was &amp;quot;In Other Words&amp;quot;, but so many people referred to it by the first lyric line, the publisher changed the title to &amp;quot;Fly Me To The Moon&amp;quot;.
