The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bachelor of Business Administration&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;BBA&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;B.B.A.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[bachelor&amp;apos;s degree]] in [[commerce]] and [[business administration]]. In most universities, the degree is conferred upon a student after four years of full-time study  in one or more areas of business concentrations; see below. The BBA program usually includes general business courses and advanced courses for specific [[Academic major|concentration]]s.

The  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;BSBA&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Bachelor of Science in Business Administration) - a variant on this degree {{cite source|date=January 2012}} - usually differs as regards to [[Curriculum#Distribution_requirements|General educational requirements]].

==Program content==
The degree&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;See for example BBA program outlines at: [http://www.uregina.ca/admin/academic/business_school/majors.htm uregina.ca]; [http://iitrade.ac.in/courses.asp?detail=bba Institute of International Trade]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; is designed to give a broad knowledge of the functional areas of a company, and their interconnection, while also allowing for specialization in a particular area. BBA programs thus expose students to a variety of &amp;quot;core subjects&amp;quot; and allow students to specialize in a specific academic area; see [[Masters of Business Administration#Program content|MBA program content]].  The degree also develops the student&amp;apos;s practical managerial skills, communication skills and business decision-making capability. Many programs thus incorporate [[training]] and practical experience, in the form of [[case study|case  projects]], presentations, [[internship]]s, industrial visits, and interaction with experts from the industry.

The [[core curriculum|core topics]] usually comprise:
{|
|-
| valign=&amp;quot;top&amp;quot; |
*[[Accounting]]
*[[Business law]] and [[Business ethics|Ethics]]
*[[Economics]]
| valign=&amp;quot;top&amp;quot; |
*[[Corporate finance|Financial management]]
*[[Human resource management]]
*[[Management Information Systems]]
| valign=&amp;quot;top&amp;quot; |
*[[Marketing]]
*[[Operations management]]
*[[Organizational behavior]]
| valign=&amp;quot;top&amp;quot; |
*Quantitative techniques ([[business statistics]], [[time value of money|financial mathematics]], [[operations research]])
*[[strategic management]]

|}

===BBA===
General educational requirements emphasize [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] (history, economics, and literature). Coverage of mathematics is generally business related, and is often limited to &amp;quot;Quantitative Applications for Business&amp;quot; or, alternatively, courses in [[business mathematics|Calculus for business]] / Calculus [[Course numbering in North America|101]], and [[business statistics]] / general statistics.

===BSBA===
The BSBA is a variant on the BBA. General educational requirements are relatively Math intensive; further, the general focus may also be more analytic, often allowing for additional quantitative optional coursework. Compare [[Bachelor of Business Science]].

==Accreditation==
Particularly in the United States, [[undergraduate]] Business Administration programs may be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]], thus indicating that the school&amp;apos;s educational curriculum meets specific quality standards; see [[Mba#Accreditation|Accreditation]] under MBA.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=AACSB accredited schools|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/AccreditedMembers.asp|publisher=AACSB}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
