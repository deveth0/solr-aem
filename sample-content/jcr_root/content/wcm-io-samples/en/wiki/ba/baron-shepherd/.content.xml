His only son, the second Baron, was also a prominent [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician and notably served as [[Leader of the House of Lords]]. After the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] removed the automatic right of [[hereditary peer]]s to sit in the [[House of Lords]] he was given a life peerage as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Shepherd of Spalding&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Spalding in the County of Lincoln, an honour given to all former Leaders of the House of Lords. On his death in 2001 the life barony became extinct, while he was succeeded in the hereditary barony by his eldest son, the third and ({{As of|2010}}) present holder of the title.
