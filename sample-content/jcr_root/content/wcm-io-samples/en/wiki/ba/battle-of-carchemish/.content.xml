{{Battles involving Assyria}}

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Battle of Carchemish&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was fought about 605 BC between the allied armies of [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and former [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]] against [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonia]].

== Background ==

When the [[Assyria]]n capital [[Nineveh]] was [[Fall of Nineveh|overrun]] by the Babylonians in 612 BC, the Assyrians moved their capital to [[Harran]]. When Harran was [[Fall of Harran|captured]] by the Babylonians in 610 BC, the capital was once again moved, this time to [[Carchemish]], on the [[Euphrates]] river. Egypt was allied with the Assyrian king [[Ashur-uballit II]], and marched in 609 BC to his aid against the Babylonians.

The Egyptian army of Pharaoh [[Necho II]] was delayed at [[Battle of Megiddo (609 BC)|Megiddo]] by the forces of King [[Josiah]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. Josiah was killed and his army was defeated. The dead body of Josiah was delivered to Jerusalem immediately and buried according to the customs of Judah&amp;apos;s kings, near the grave of King [[David]].

The Egyptians and Assyrians together crossed the Euphrates and laid siege to Harran, which they failed to retake. They then retreated to northern Syria.

==Battle==
The Egyptians met the full might of the Babylonian army led by [[Nebuchadrezzar II]] at Carchemish where the combined Egyptian and Assyrian forces were soundly destroyed. Assyria ceased to exist as an independent power, and Egypt retreated and was no longer a significant force in the [[Ancient Near East]]. Babylonia reached its economic peak after 605 BC.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;King, Philip J., 1993 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jeremiah: An Archaeological Companion&amp;apos;&amp;apos; , Westminster/John Knox Press p.22 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7xZ-HUcAEP8C&amp;amp;pg=PA22&amp;amp;dq=carchemish+battle+605&amp;amp;ei=0rNzSI6TIJXEigG_6_zpBw&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U1Wzw_pgL4_ZsnOWUInugnu63dVpA]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Records of the battle==
The Jerusalem Chronicle, part of the [[Babylonian Chronicles]], now housed in the [[British Museum]], claims that Nebuchadnezzar &amp;quot;crossed the river to go against the Egyptian army which lay in KarchemiÅ¡. They fought with each other and the Egyptian army withdrew before him. He accomplished their defeat and beat them to non-existence. As for the rest of the Egyptian army which had escaped from the defeat so quickly that no weapon had reached them, in the district of [[Hamath]] the Babylonian troops [[Battle of Hama|overtook and defeated them]] so that not a single man escaped to his own country. At that time Nebuchadnezzar conquered the whole area of Hamath.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc5/jerusalem.html Chronicle Concerning the Early Years of Nebuchadnezzar II. Retrieved July 18, 2010.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The battle is also mentioned and described in the [[Bible]], in the Book of Jeremiah.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The Bible, Jer. 46:3-12&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
