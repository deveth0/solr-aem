&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Robert Baillie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baillie of Jerviswood&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; ca. 1634 &amp;amp;ndash; 24 December 1684) was a Scottish conspirator implicated in the [[Rye House Plot]] against [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]. He was executed for [[treason]].

Baillie was the son of [[George Baillie]] of [[St John&amp;apos;s Kirk]], [[Lanarkshire]], who had bought the estate of [[Jerviswood]] in 1636  and of [[Mellerstain House|Mellerstain]] in 1643, under [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. He incurred the resentment of the [[government of Scotland|Scottish government]] by rescuing, in June 1676, his brother-in-law [[James Kirkton]], a [[Presbyterian]] [[Church of Scotland]] minister who had been seized and confined in a house by [[Carstairs]], an informer. He was fined £500, remaining in prison for four months and then being liberated on paying half the fine to Carstairs. In despair at the state of his country, he determined in 1683 to emigrate to [[South Carolina]], but the plan came to nothing.

The same year, Baillie, with some of his friends, went to [[London]] and entered into communication with the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], [[William Russell, Lord Russell|Lord Russell]], and their party  to conspire to bring Monmouth to the throne; and on the discovery of the Rye House Plot, Baillie was arrested. Questioned by [[Charles II of England|King Charles]], Baillie denied any knowledge of the conspiracy, but would not deny that he had been consulted with the view of an insurrection in Scotland. He was subsequently put in irons and sent back a prisoner to Scotland. Although no evidence has come to light to support his connection with the plot, he was fined £6,000 and kept in close confinement.

On 23 December 1684, he was brought up again before the [[High Court of Justiciary|High Court]] on the charge of treason. He was pronounced guilty the next day and hanged the same afternoon at the [[Mercat Cross]] at [[Edinburgh]]. Baillie became a [[cause célèbre]] for [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] and [[Scottish independence|Scottish nationalists]] in years to come.

[[Gilbert Burnet|Bishop Burnet]], who was his cousin, describes him as &amp;quot;in the presbyterian principles but ... a man of great piety and virtue, learned in the [[law]], in [[mathematics]] and in [[foreign language|languages]].&amp;quot; He married a sister of [[Archibald Johnston, Lord Warriston|Lord Warriston]], and left a son, [[George Baillie|George]], who took refuge in [[Holland]], afterwards returning with [[William III of England|William III]] and being restored to his estates before marrying [[Grizel Baillie|Lady Grizel Hume]].
