Count &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baltzar Bogislaus von Platen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (29 May 1766 &amp;amp;ndash; 6 December 1829) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] naval officer and statesman.&amp;lt;ref name=ne /&amp;gt; He was born on the island of [[Rügen]] (now Germany) to Philip Julius Bernhard von Platen, [[List of Swedish Field Marshals|Field Marshal]] and the Swedish [[Governor-General in the Swedish Realm|Governor General]] of [[Swedish Pomerania|Pomerania]], and Regina Juliana von Usedom.

==Swedish Navy==
At age 13 Baltzar entered the [[Royal Swedish Navy]] where he served with distinction until resigning in 1800, having attained the rank of Captain.

==Göta Canal==
Following the revolution in 1809 he became a member [[Privy Council of Sweden|Government]] and, in the following year, received a promotion to Rear Admiral. He was also made chairman of the [[Göta Canal]] directorate charged with constructing a canal across Sweden. The canal, following a design by [[Thomas Telford]], would only be completed in 1832, after von Platen&amp;apos;s death, but during its construction, he did discover two skilled mechanical engineering brothers [[John Ericsson]] and [[Nils Ericson]].

==Honors==
He was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1815. He was appointed [[Governor of Norway]] on 26 November 1827, a position which he held until his death in [[Oslo|Christiania]], the [[Norway|Norwegian]] capital, on 6 December 1829.

==Burial site==
He was married to Hedvig Elisabeth Ekman. Baltzar von Platen&amp;apos;s grave is at the side of the Göta Canal in [[Motala]], where it is something of a tourist attraction, especially for canal visitors.
