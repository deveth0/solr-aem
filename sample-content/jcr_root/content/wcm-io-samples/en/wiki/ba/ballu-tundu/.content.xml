&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ballu tundu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ballu bardu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a traditional [[Italian folk dance]] from the island of [[Sardinia]] which is typically danced in a closed or open circle. The dance was described as early as 1805 by Mameli and by [[Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora|La Marmora]] in 1825. In northern and central Sardinia, the dance is lively and animated with leaps and agile movements and usually accompanied by a choir of three or more singers in the center of the circle. In other areas, the dance is done to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[launeddas]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the shepherd&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;sulittu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; but the accordion had also made its appearance by the 19th century. The Introduction is in 2/4 time but the dance itself is done in 6/8.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=Dances of Italy|last=Galanti|first=Bianca M.|location=New York|publisher=Chanticleer Press|year=1950|pages=13â€“14}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ond&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=Costumi, musica, danze e feste popolari italiane|last=Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro|location=Roma|publisher=Edizione O.N.D.|year=1931}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

At least in the past, the manner of holding hands was very important and followed strict rules. Married or engaged couples could hold hands palm to palm with fingers entwined, but a man could not do this with a young girl or another man&amp;apos;s wife. If a stranger entered the circle, he had to do so to the woman&amp;apos;s right so as not to come between her and her husband.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ond&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
