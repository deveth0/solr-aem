Lord Glenconner was succeeded by his second son, the second Baron. He was succeeded in 1983 by his eldest son, the third Baron, who bought the island of [[Mustique]]. {{As of|2010}} the titles are held by the third Baron&amp;apos;s grandson, the fourth Baron, who, when he succeeded in August 2010 became the next to youngest peer in the Realm. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tennant Baronetcy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of The Glen and St Rolux, was created in the [[Baronetage of the United Kingdom]] in 1885 for [[Sir Charles Tennant, 1st Baronet|Charles Tennant]], a businessman and Liberal [[Member of Parliament]] and the grandson of the chemist and industrialist [[Charles Tennant]].

[[Margot Tennant]], wife of Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]], was the daughter of the first Baronet from his first marriage. The civil servant and politician [[Katharine Elliot, Baroness Elliot of Harwood]], was the daughter of the first Baronet from his second marriage. The war poet [[Edward Wyndham Tennant]] was the eldest son of the first Baron. The Hon. [[Stephen Tennant]] was the fourth son of the first Baron.
