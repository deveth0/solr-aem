&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Backnang&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Audio-IPA|Backnang.ogg|}}) is a [[town]] in [[Germany]] in the [[Bundesland (Germany)|Bundesland]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]], roughly 30 kilometers northeast of [[Stuttgart]]. Its population has increased greatly over the past century, from 7,650 in 1900 to 35,761 in 2005.

Backnang was ceded to Württemberg by the [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] ([[Zähringer]] family) in 1325. Backnang has been known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gerberstadt&amp;apos;&amp;apos; due to several [[Tanning|tanneries]] and [[leather]] [[factory|factories]], and [[wool]] and cloth [[mill (factory)|mill]]s that dominated Backnang&amp;apos;s industries. Today, all of these have vanished and, instead, [[telecommunication]] companies like [[Ericsson]] (formerly [[AEG]], [[Telefunken]], [[ANT Nachrichtentechnik]], [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] and [[Marconi Company|Marconi]]) and [[Tesat-Spacecom]] dominate the town&amp;apos;s industries. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stiftskirche&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, formerly the church of [[Backnang Abbey]], dates back to the 12th century.

Backnang&amp;apos;s cultural highlight is the annual &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Strassenfest&amp;apos;&amp;apos; during the last weekend in June. It has been founded as a street festival where local sports and cultural clubs offered drinks and foods. The traditional opening of the Strassenfest is marked with cannon shots from the picturesque city tower at 6 p.m. on Friday and ends with the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zapfenstreich&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on the following Monday at 11 p.m. The Strassenfest tends to attract more than 100,000 spectators.

Another cultural highlight in Backnang is the annual Murr-Regatta organized by the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jugendzentrum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (youth center). It is generally held two weeks after the street festival. The Regatta is a race down the river Murr in self-made boats. Besides the prize for the fastest boat, an environmental prize is awarded to the crew that collects the most rubbish along the way, an originality prize is given to the most creative crew, and a drunkenness prize to the most inebriated crew.

The local Jugendzentrum (youth center) is remarkable as it has been independently self-administered by Backnang&amp;apos;s youth and young adults for more than 30 years. It hosts numerous concerts and contributes events to the cultural life of Backnang.
