&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Barré Studio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was, in all probability, the first film studio dedicated to animation (the rival for this honor is [[Bray Productions]]).  It was founded by [[Raoul Barré]] and [[Bill Nolan (animator)|William Nolan]] in 1914.  They began with advertising films (among the first animated films used to sell something), then got a series with [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Animated Grouch Chaser&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The series was mostly live-action with a few animated inserts, not really all that bad in quality for the time they were made.  The studio also put out the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Phables&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Boob Weekly&amp;apos;&amp;apos; cartoons.  Animators included [[Frank Moser (artist)|Frank Moser]], [[Gregory La Cava]], [[George Stallings (animator)|George Stallings]], Tom Norton and [[Pat Sullivan (film producer)|Pat Sullivan]], all of whom got their starts here.  [[Rube Goldberg]] was the writer for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Boob Weekly&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 1916, [[William Randolph Hearst]] founded [[International Film Service]], and hired all of Barré&amp;apos;s animators to work for him, including Bill Nolan.  Soon afterward, Barré was contacted by [[Charles Bowers]], who had been animating &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Mutt and Jeff (comic strip)|Mutt and Jeff]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for a year.  The series was doing so well that it had outgrown Bowers&amp;apos; studio.  A partnership was formed: Bowers&amp;apos; animators and series worked on in Barré&amp;apos;s studio.  The result was the Bud Fisher Film Corporation, named for the originator [[Bud Fisher]] of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mutt and Jeff&amp;apos;&amp;apos; comic strip.  It was known in the industry as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Barré-Bowers Studio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  Fisher took all public credit for the cartoons, while Barré supervised the animators and Bowers handled the books.  He &amp;quot;handled&amp;quot; the books so well, in fact, that he ruined the company: Barré quit in 1918 to avoid getting charged as an accomplice; Bowers was fired in 1919 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;and&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1921.  Once Fisher was in charge, he proved his financial abilities by completely bankrupting Barré-Bowers in 1923. (C Revelation Films)
Besides Barré and Bowers, directors at their studio included [[Manny Gould]] and Dick Friel.  Animators included C. T. Anderson, Clarence Rigby, George Stallings, [[Ted Sears]], [[Mannie Davis]], [[Burt Gillett]], [[Dick Huemer]], [[Ben Sharpsteen]], [[Bill Tytla]], [[Albert Hurter]], Carl Lederer, F. M. Follett, [[Isadore Klein]], Milt Gross, [[Walter Lantz]] and George Ruffle.
