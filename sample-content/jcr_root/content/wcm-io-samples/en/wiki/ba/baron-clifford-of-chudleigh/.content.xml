&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Clifford of Chudleigh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Chudleigh in the County of Devon, is a title in the [[Peerage of England]]. It was created in 1672 for [[Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford of Chudleigh|Thomas Clifford]]. The title was created as &amp;quot;Clifford of Chudleigh&amp;quot; rather than simply &amp;quot;Clifford&amp;quot; to differentiate it from several other Clifford Baronies, including the [[Baron de Clifford|Barony of de Clifford]], which is extant.

The family seat is [[Ugbrooke Park]] in [[Devon]].
