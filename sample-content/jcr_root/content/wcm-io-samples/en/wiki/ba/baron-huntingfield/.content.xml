        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Huntingfield&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a title that has been created three times, twice in the [[Peerage of England]] and once in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]. The first two creations were by [[Hereditary_peer#Writs_of_summons|writ]], but little more is known about them. They probably became extinct or fell into [[abeyance]] on the death of their first holders. The third creation, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Huntingfield&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of [[Heveningham Hall]] in the County of Suffolk, was created in the [[Peerage of Ireland]] in 1796 for [[Joshua Vanneck, 1st Baron Huntingfield|Sir Joshua Vanneck, 3rd Baronet]], [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Dunwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunwich]]. His son, the second Baron, also represented this constituency in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. His great-grandson, the fifth Baron (who succeeded his uncle), was [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Member of Parliament for [[Eye (UK Parliament constituency)|Eye]] and [[Governor of Victoria]]. {{As of|2010}} the titles are held by the latter&amp;apos;s grandson, the seventh Baron, who succeeded his father in 1994.

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vanneck Baronetcy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Putney in the County of Surrey, was created in the [[Baronetage of Great Britain]] in 1751 for [[Sir Joshua Vanneck, 1st Baronet|Joshua Vanneck]], a [[London]] merchant of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] origin. His eldest son, the second Baronet, represented Dunwich in Parliament. He was succeeded in this seat and in the baronetcy by his younger brother, the third Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage as Baron Huntingfield in 1796.

[[Peter Vanneck|Sir Peter Vanneck]], [[Lord Mayor of London]] in 1978, was the second son of the fifth Baron.

The former seat of the Vanneck family was Heveningham Hall near [[Heveningham]] and [[Huntingfield, Suffolk|Huntingfield]] in [[Suffolk]]. However, the house was sold to the government in 1970.

As of 30 June 2006, the present holder of the barony has not successfully proven his succession to the baronetcy and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant. However, the case is under review by the Registrar of the Baronetage (for more information follow this [http://www.baronetage.org/succession-to-baronetcy/ link]).
