The {{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Battle of Tedorigawa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|手取川の戦い|Tedorigawa no Tatakai}} took place near the [[Tedori River]] in [[Japan]]&amp;apos;s [[Kaga Province]] in 1577. The battle site is in the modern-day [[Ishikawa Prefecture]].

== Background ==
The Tedorigawa Campaign was precipitated by [[Uesugi]] intervention inside the domain of the [[Hatakeyama clan]], an Oda [[Client state]]. This event provoked the Uesugi incursion was a Coup d&amp;apos;état led by the pro Oda General Chō Shigetsura, that killed Hatakeyama Yoshinori the lord of Noto and replaced him with Hatakeyama Yoshitaka as a puppet ruler. As a result [[Uesugi Kenshin]], the head of the Uesegi clan mobilized an army to lead into Noto against Shigetsura. Consequently Nobunaga sent an army led by [[Shibata Katsuie]]; one of his most experienced generals to reinforce their allies.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Uesugi Kenshin&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.samurai-archives.com/kenshin.html Uesugi Kenshin&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Battle ==

Kenshin, taking the initiative moved to [[Encirclement|encircle]] Shigetsura’s forces preventing them from linking with the Oda army, and trapping Shigetsura in Anamizu Castle (the main Hatakeyama stronghold) the subsequent [[Breakthrough (military)|Breakthrough]] killed Shigetsura and resulted in the Hatakeyama switching allegiance to the Uesugi.

Due to the fall of Anamizu Castle the Oda army (now joined by Nobunaga himself) halted their march into Noto near the Tedori River and prepared to use cannons for [[stand-off]]  tactics against the Uesugi. However a skillful nighttime [[feint]] by Kenshin (suggesting he had divided his forces) led to Nobunaga ordering Katsuie to charge against the Uesugi lines. Kenshin ordered the river’s floodgates to be opened. The strong current from the river prevented the [[Oda clan]] from effectively using its Arquebus and cannons. The Oda charge itself was repulsed due to the current and inferior close quarter ability of the [[ashigaru]] making up the bulk of the Oda army. Having suffered heavy casualties, Nobunaga ordered a retreat into [[Ōmi Province]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Uesugi Kenshin&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Rekishi Gunzô Shirizu , Uesugi Kenshin Japan: Gakken, 1999&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Aftermath ==
The Uesugi scored a significant victory at Tedorigawa. As a result the distribution of power in the north shifted towards Kenshin and the Uesugi were temporarily able to extend their influence as far as the [[Kaga Province]].Kenshin however, died before that plan was initiated. Subsequently the Uesugi fell into a [[Ōtate no Ran|civil war]] and as a result by 1582 the Oda forces had managed to push the Uesugi clan all the way back to the [[Echigo Province]].
