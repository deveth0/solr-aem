&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Churston&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Churston Ferrers and Lupton in the County of Devon, is a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created in 1858 for the former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament]], [[John Yarde-Buller, 1st Baron Churston|Sir John Yarde, 3rd Baronet]]. He had earlier represented [[South Devon (UK Parliament constituency)|South Devon]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Two years later, in 1860, he assumed by Royal license the additional surname of Buller. {{As of|2010}} the titles are held by his great-great-great-grandson, the fifth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1991.

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baronetcy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Churston Court in the County of Devon, was created in the [[Baronetage of Great Britain]] in 1790 for the lawyer [[Sir Francis Buller, 1st Baronet|Sir Francis Buller]]. He was the son of [[James Buller (the younger)|James Buller]]. The first Baronet&amp;apos;s son, the second Baronet, represented [[Totnes (UK Parliament constituency)|Totnes]] in the House of Commons. In 1800, he assumed by Royal license the surname of Yarde. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the aforementioned third Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage in 1858.

The Barons Churston are related to the [[Viscount Dilhorne|Viscounts Dilhorne]]. Sir Edward Manningham-Buller, 1st Baronet, of Dilhorne, third son of Sir Francis Yarde, 2nd Baronet, of Churston Court, was the great-grandfather of [[Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne]]. Also, Hon. Joan Yarde-Buller, daughter of the third Baron Churston, married [[Prince Aly Khan]]. The fifth and present Baron is a first cousin of [[Aga Khan IV]].
