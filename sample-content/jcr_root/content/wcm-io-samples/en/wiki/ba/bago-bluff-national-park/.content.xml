&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bago Bluff&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[national park]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], approximately 410&amp;amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Sydney]]. It is situated south west of [[Wauchope, New South Wales|Wauchope]] and includes parts of the former Broken Bago State Forest and a part of Lorne State Forest. The Bago Bluff National Park also includes in the northern section the old Bago Bluff Flora Reserve and Six B Flora Reserve.

Bago Bluff offers splendid views of the Hastings Valley from the top of the bluff which can be accessed via several forest roads from the south, including Bago Road.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.camdenhaveninfo.org.au/pages/camdenhaven/VisitingCH/WhatToDo/nationalparks.htm National Parks in the Camden Haven Region] Retrieved on 25 March 2009&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The park’s northern boundary is on southern side of the [[Oxley Highway]] where there are two badly washed 4WD tracks into the park.

Quarries in the park have previously yielded leaf and shell fossils.

Birds that may be spotted in the park include: [[Australian Magpie]]s (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cracticus tibicen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), [[Golden Whistler]]s (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pachycephala pectoralis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), green winged pigeons, grey [[fantail]]s (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rhipidura&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), [[kookaburra]]s (genus Dacelo), [[large-billed Scrubwren]]s (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sericornis magnirostris&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), [[Spotted Pardalote]]s (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pardalotus punctatus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), [[pied currawong]]s (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Strepera graculina&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), [[Striated Thornbill]]s (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Acanthiza lineata&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and [[White-browed Scrubwren]]s (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sericornis frontalis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://dazed.org/npa/scraps/BEtrip199907.htm North East NSW Parks and Reserves] Retrieved on 25 March 2009&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Lantana]] has become a problem in the park where it is almost covering some of the tracks.
