&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Sudeley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a title that has been created thrice in British history, twice in the [[Peerage of England]] and once in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. The first creation came in the [[Peerage of England]] in 1299 when John de Sudeley was summoned to Parliament as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lord Sudeley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. On the death of the third Baron in 1367 the title fell into [[abeyance]]. The abeyance was terminated in 1380 when Thomas Boteler, the fourth Baron, became sole heir. The sixth Baron was created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Sudeley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[letters patent]] in 1441. He served as [[Lord High Treasurer]] from 1444 to 1447. On his death in 1473 the 1441 creation became extinct while the 1299 creation once again fell into abeyance.

The third creation came in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]] in 1838 when [[Charles Hanbury-Tracy, 1st Baron Sudeley|Charles Hanbury-Tracy]] was created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Sudeley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Toddington in the County of Gloucester. He had previously represented [[Tewkesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Tewkesbury]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] as a [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig]] and served as [[Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire]]. He was also as Chairman of the Royal Commission appointed to judge designs for the new [[Westminster Palace|Houses of Parliament]]. He married his cousin Hon. Henrietta Susanna, daughter and heiress of Henry Leigh Tracy, 8th and last Viscount Tracy, through which marriage the estate of [[Toddington Manor]] in [[Gloucestershire]] came into the Hanbury family. Five days before the marriage Charles Hanbury assumed the additional surname of Tracy.

He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He sat as a [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Wallingford (UK Parliament constituency)|Wallingford]] and served as Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire. In 1806 Lord Sudeley assumed by Royal license the surname of Leigh in lieu of his patronymic. However, in 1839 he discontinued the use of this surname and resumed by Royal license his original surname of Hanbury-Tracy. On his death the title passed to his son, the third Baron. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Baron. He was a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Montgomery (UK Parliament constituency)|Montgomery]] from 1863 to 1877 and served under [[William Ewart Gladstone]] as [[Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms|Captain of the Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms]] in 1886. However, he later came into financial difficulties which caused the sale of the family seat of [[Toddington Manor]]. {{As of|2010}} the title is held by his great-grandson, the seventh Baron, who succeeded his first cousin once removed, the sixth Baron, in 1941.

The Hon. [[Frederick Hanbury-Tracy]], younger son of the second Baron, was Member of Parliament for Montgomery.
