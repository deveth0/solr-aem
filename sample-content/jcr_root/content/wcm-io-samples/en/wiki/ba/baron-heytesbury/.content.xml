        text="&lt;p&gt;[[Image:William à Court 2.jpg|thumb|William à Court, &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; 1st Baron Heytesbury]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Heytesbury&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of [[Heytesbury]] in the County of [[Wiltshire]], is a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created in 1828 for the prominent politician and diplomat [[William à Court, 1st Baron Heytesbury|Sir William à Court, 2nd Baronet]], who later served as [[British Ambassador to Russia|Ambassador to Russia]] and as [[Viceroy of Ireland]]. His son, the second Baron, sat as [[Member of Parliament]] for the [[Isle of Wight (UK Parliament constituency)|Isle of Wight]]. On his marriage in 1837 to Elizabeth Holmes, daughter of Sir Leonard Worsley Holmes, Lord Heytesbury assumed the additional surname of Holmes. {{As of|2010}} the titles are held by his great-great-great-grandson, the seventh Baron, who succeeded his father in 2004.

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baronetcy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Heytesbury House in the County of Wiltshire, was created in the [[Baronetage of Great Britain]] on 4 July 1795 for the first Baron father, [[Sir William à Court, 1st Baronet|William à Court]]. He was a [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] in the army and represented [[Heytesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Heytesbury]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. His father, [[William Ashe-à Court]], was a [[general]] in the army and also sat as a Member of Parliament for Heytesbury.

A junior line of the family has attained fortune and fame in Australia, thanks to the business empire of [[Robert Holmes à Court]], who was of South African birth, and his Western Australian wife [[Janet|Janet Holmes à Court]], now one of Australia&amp;apos;s richest women. Their vast business interests are managed through [[Heytesbury Pty Ltd]], a company named after the family peerage. The current heir presumptive, [[Peter Holmes à Court]], belongs to the Australian branch of the family.&amp;lt;ReF&amp;gt;http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/index998.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
