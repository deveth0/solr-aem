The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baschet Brothers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are two [[French people|French]] brothers named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;François Baschet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 30 March 1920, in [[Paris]]) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bernard Baschet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 24 August 1917, [[Paris]]) who collaborate on creating [[sound sculpture]]s and inventing [[musical instrument]]s, such as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[cristal Baschet]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. François Baschet is a [[sculptor]] and Bernard Baschet is an [[engineer]]. The Baschet Brothers invented the [[inflatable guitar]], the aluminum piano and many other [[experimental musical instrument]]s. They created an &amp;quot;educational instrumentarium&amp;quot; for exposing young people to musical concepts.

==Career==
François had wanted to be an artist, but his father warned him against pursuing the unstable life of an artist. He decided to study business in college, but felt no passion for it. After [[World War II]], which had interrupted his education, he decided to travel around the world. He brought with him on his trip a [[guitar]] to help him earn a living, but wanting something more portable he invented an inflatable guitar using a [[balloon]] and a collapsible wood neck. He continued to perform with this guitar upon his return to [[Paris]]. Soon he and his brother, who had studied engineering, began collaborating on sculptural musical instruments.

Beginning in 1952, the Baschets started research into all existing musical instruments and put this knowledge to work in creating dozens of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;structures sonores&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (i.e., &amp;apos;sonorous sculptures&amp;apos;). Their visually striking instruments are crafted out of [[steel]] and [[aluminum]] and [[amplifier|amplified]] by large curved conical sheets of metal, and are most often easy to play and accessible to people with any level of experience. One example of this is the [[Hemisfair Musical Fountain]], which consists of an array of posts at the top of which are groups of conical sound diffusers, and above them circles of metal prongs. These are played by jets of water aimed by observers.

In 1954, the brothers met Jacques and Yvonne Lasry. Jacques was a [[pianist]] and [[composer]] and Yvonne was an [[organist]]. The four formed an association which they called &amp;quot;Lasry-Baschet Sound Structures.&amp;quot; They held their first concerts in 1955. The group was successful and in 1960 were asked by [[Jean Cocteau]] to provide music for his film, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Testament of Orpheus|Le Testament d&amp;apos;Orphée]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The group toured, appearing on [[television]] shows including [[The Ed Sullivan Show]]. In 1966 they were invited to hold an exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and director [[Alfred Barr]] purchased a sculpture for the museum&amp;apos;s collection

In the 1960s the Lasrys immigrated to [[Israel]]. In 1977 Bernard met Michel Deneuve, a musician, who joined them, starting a new association, and assisted creating instruments. Deneuve was especially dedicated to working on their instrument called the &amp;quot;Cristal&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://francois.baschet.free.fr/story.htm Baschet website]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
