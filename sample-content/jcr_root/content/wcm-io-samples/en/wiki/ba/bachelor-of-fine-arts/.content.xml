A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bachelor of Fine Arts&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;BFA&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;B.F.A.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | title = B.F.A. in Theater | url = http://www.theaterdance.ucsb.edu/drama_degreesbfa.php | publisher = [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] | accessdate = January 22, 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) is the standard [[undergraduate]] [[Academic degree|degree]] for students in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] seeking a professional education in the [[visual arts|visual]] or [[performing arts]]. In some countries such a degree is called a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bachelor of Creative Arts&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;BCA&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). In [[Great Britain]] the equivalent degree is the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bachelor of Arts in Fine Arts&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In [[Australia]] the Bachelor of Fine Arts is awarded to students completing a degree in visual arts, but not performing arts. Specific degrees such as the Bachelor of Dance or Bachelor of Drama are used in the performing arts in Australia and much of [[Europe]]. In [[India]] a Fine Arts undergraduate degree is known as a BFA or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;BVA&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.targetstudy.com/degree/bachelor-of-fine-arts/ BFA - BVA: Bachelor of Fine Arts]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bachelor of Visual Arts&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). It is a four-year degree. The eligibility for this course is 10+2 pass in any stream from a recognised educational board.

In the United States the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree differs from a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in that the majority of the program consists of a practical studio component, as contrasted with lecture and discussion classes. A typical BFA program in the United States consists of two-thirds study in the arts, with one-third in more general [[liberal arts]] studies. For a BA in Art, the ratio might be reversed.

The [[National Association of Schools of Art and Design]] (NASAD), which accredits Bachelor of Fine Arts programs in visual art and design in the United States, states that &amp;quot;the professional degree (BFA) focuses on intensive work in the visual arts supported by a program of general studies,&amp;quot; whereas &amp;quot;the liberal arts degree (BA) focuses on art and design in the context of a broad program of general studies.&amp;quot;

A Bachelor of Fine Arts degree will often require an area of specialty such as [[acting]], [[musical theatre]], [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[computer animation]], [[creative writing]], [[dance]], [[dramatic writing]], [[drawing]], [[fiber]], [[film production]], [[visual effects]], [[animation]], [[graphic design]], [[illustration]], [[industrial design]], [[visual arts]], [[interior design]], [[metalworking]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts in Music|music]], [[new media]], [[painting]], [[photography]], [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]], [[stage management]], or [[television production]]. Some schools instead give their students a broad education in many disciplines of the arts.

Although a Bachelor of Fine Arts is traditionally considered a four-year degree, a BFA program may take longer to complete because of the amount of studio course work required.
