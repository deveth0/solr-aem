{{Campaignbox Sixth Coalition}}

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Battle of Brienne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was fought on January 29, 1814, and resulted in the victory of Emperor [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I&amp;apos;s]] French forces over the [[Russia]]n and [[Prussia]]n forces commanded by the Prussian [[Generalfeldmarschall]] [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Prince von Blücher]].

The battle followed on the heels of reverses suffered by the French in both 1812, which had gutted the strength of the French, and 1813, where they fought against the [[Sixth Coalition]]. The Sixth Coalition had intentions of deposing Napoleon, dissolving the [[First French Empire]] and restoring the Bourbon monarchy to France.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite book|title=The Napoleonic Wars: The Fall of the French Empire 1813–1815|author=Gregory Fremont-Barnes|year= 2002|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1-84176-431-0}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Prelude==
The battle (the first of the 1814 Campaign) took place near [[Brienne-le-Château]], where Napoleon had attended military school in his early years. As the Allies advanced on France from three different directions, the French Emperor planned to attack and defeat each in turn.

Napoleon&amp;apos;s first target was the spread-out force of some 17,000 Russians (part of the combined Prusso-Russian Army of Silesia) under Field Marshal Blücher. To battle his old adversary, Napoleon had a force of some 30,000 troops, but most of these were just out of the recruiting camps with little training and no wartime experience. Napoleon had tried to accomplish an envelopment of Blucher&amp;apos;s whole force near the Aube River, but allied cavalry captured a set of the Emperor&amp;apos;s orders and Blucher avoided the trap. Additionally, rain had turned many area roads into mud, slowing Napoleon&amp;apos;s advance. Napoleon finally caught up with Blucher near Brienne. Blucher, outnumbered, with only Russian Lt. General [[Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken|Baron Osten-Sachen&amp;apos;s]] wing of his army on hand ([[Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Yorck&amp;apos;s]] Prussian I Corps was out of supporting distance) was forced to accept battle, as his army&amp;apos;s baggage trains were too close – stuck on the muddy roads between Brienne and Dienville.

==The battle==
The French emperor began the clash by pinning the enemy down while he organised a flanking attack. General [[Emmanuel de Grouchy, Marquis de Grouchy|Grouchy&amp;apos;s]] cavalry and [[horse artillery]] kept the Prussians occupied as marshals [[Michel Ney|Ney]] (with the Imperial Young Guard Corps) and [[Claude Victor-Perrin, Duc de Belluno|Victor]] (commanding French II Corps) secured both the town of Brienne and its chateau. About dusk, the chateau was captured by the French, when Blucher thought the battle was nearly over, and was preparing for dinner. Blucher and his second-in-command [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau|General von Gneisenau]] only just managed to elude capture. During the heavy fighting Napoleon was almost taken prisoner by Russian [[Cossacks]]. The battle ended about midnight when the allies retreated. Blucher left behind some 4000 casualties to France&amp;apos;s 3000.

== Trivia ==

The &amp;quot;[[Brienner Straße (Munich)|Brienner Straße]]&amp;quot; (Brienne Street) in the [[Bavaria]]n capital [[Munich]] is named after the battle to commemorate the Bavarian contribution in the battle.
