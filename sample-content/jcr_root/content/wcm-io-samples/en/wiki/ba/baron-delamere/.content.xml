&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Delamere&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of [[Vale Royal Abbey|Vale Royal]] in the County of Chester, is a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created in 1821 for [[Thomas Cholmondeley, 1st Baron Delamere|Thomas Cholmondeley]], a former [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Cheshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Cheshire]].  This Vale Royal branch of the Cholmondeley family descends from Thomas Cholmondeley (died 1653), younger brother of [[Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Leinster]] and Hugh Cholmondeley (1591–1665), ancestor of the [[Marquess of Cholmondeley|Marquesses of Cholmondeley]]. The first Baron was succeeded by his son. Before acceding to the title in 1855, the second Baron represented [[Denbighshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Denbighshire]] and [[Montgomery (UK Parliament constituency)|Montgomery]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] as a [[Tory]].
His eldest son, also named Hugh, acceded to the title in 1887 and in the same year, he emigrated to [[Kenya]], where he acquired a major estate. The third Baron&amp;apos;s eldest son inherited his father&amp;apos;s title in 1931. In 1934, he attempted to re-establish his family at Vale Royal, the family&amp;apos;s country home and baronial seat from the 17th century; however, the great house was requisitioned as a sanatorium during the war years.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Holland, G.D &amp;apos;&amp;apos;et al.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1977). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vale Royal Abbey and House,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; p. 32; Westair-Reproductions: [https://id409.van.ca.siteprotect.com/westair-reproductions/mappage/cheshire.htm  Cheshire, Museum finder]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; When it was sold in 1947, the fourth Baron returned to Kenya. {{As of|2010}} the title is held by the fifth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1979. He also lives in Kenya.

The family surname is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ʌ|m|l|i}}.
