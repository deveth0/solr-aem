        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bazilio Olara-Okello&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1929 &amp;amp;ndash; 9 January 1990) was a [[Uganda]]n [[Officer (armed forces)|military officer]] and one of the [[commander]]s of the [[Uganda National Liberation Army]] (UNLA) that together with the [[Tanzania People&amp;apos;s Defence Force|Tanzanian army]] overthrew [[Idi Amin]] in 1979. In 1985, he was briefly the chairman of the ruling Military Council and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;de facto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[President of Uganda|head of state of Uganda]], and later, [[Lieutenant General]] and chief of the armed forces.

During the [[Ugandan Bush War|civil war in Uganda]] between the UNLA (which was now the national army) and [[Yoweri Museveni]]&amp;apos;s [[National Resistance Army]], president [[Milton Obote]] alienated much of the [[Acholi]]-dominated officer corps, including Olara-Okello and General [[Tito Okello]], by appointing his fellow ethnic [[Langi people|Lango]], Brigadier Smith Opon Acak, as army Chief of Staff. On 27 July 1985, an army brigade of the UNLA commanded by Olara-Okello, and composed mostly of [[Acholi]] troops, staged a [[coup d&amp;apos;état]] against [[Milton Obote]]&amp;apos;s government and seized power. The [[National Assembly of Uganda|National Assembly]] was dissolved and a Military Council was established. Between 27 and 29 July 1985, Olara-Okello was Chairman of the Military Council, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;de facto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; head of state.

On 29 July, General [[Tito Okello]] replaced Olara-Okello as Chairman of the Military Council, and Olara-Okello was promoted from the rank of [[Brigadier]] to that of [[Lieutenant General]], and named chief of the armed forces. He commanded the army until [[Yoweri Museveni]]&amp;apos;s [[National Resistance Army]] seized power on 26 January 1986. Olara-Okello fled to exile in [[Sudan]], where he lived until he died in Ormduruman Hospital in [[Khartoum]] on 9 January 1990.
