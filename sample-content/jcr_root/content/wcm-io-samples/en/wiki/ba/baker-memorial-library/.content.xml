Baker Library opened in 1928 with a collection of 240,000 volumes. The building was designed by Jens Frederick Larson, modeled after [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] in Philadelphia, and funded by a gift to [[Dartmouth College]] by [[George Fisher Baker]] in memory of his uncle (Fisher Ames Baker, Dartmouth class of 1859). The facility was expanded in 1941 and 1957–1958 and received its one millionth volume in 1970.

In 1992, John Berry and the Baker family donated US $30 million for the construction of a new facility adjoining the Baker Library. In 2000 the Berry Library, designed by architect [[Robert Venturi]], opened. The Dartmouth College libraries presently hold over 2 million volumes in their collections.
