&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Langford&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Summerhill in the County of Meath, is a title in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]. It was created on 1 July 1800 for [[Clotworthy Rowley, 1st Baron Langford|Clotworthy Rowley]], who had earlier represented [[Trim (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Trim]] and [[Meath (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|County Meath]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]]. Born Clotworthy Taylor, he was the fourth son of [[Thomas Taylor, 1st Earl of Bective]] (whose eldest son was created [[Marquess of Headfort]] in 1800) and Jane Rowley, daughter of Hercules Langford Rowley and his wife Elizabeth Rowley, 1st Viscountess Langford (created 1766). The viscountcy of Langford became extinct in 1796 on the death of Hercules Rowley, 2nd Viscount Langford. Clotworthy Taylor succeeded to the Rowley estates and assumed by Royal license the surname of Rowley in lieu of Taylor. Four years later the Langford title was revived when he was raised to the [[Peerage of Ireland]] as Baron Langford.

Lord Langford&amp;apos;s great-grandson, the fourth Baron, sat in the [[House of Lords]] as an [[Representative peer|Irish Representative Peer]] from 1884 to 1919. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Baron. On his early death in 1922 the title passed to his uncle, the sixth Baron. He was succeeded by his nephew, the seventh Baron. When he died in 1952 the line of the third Baron failed, and the title was inherited by the late Baron&amp;apos;s first cousin once removed, the eighth Baron. He was the son of Colonel the Hon. Hercules Langford Boyle Rowley, second son of the second Baron. On his death in 1953 this line of the family also failed and the title was inherited by his second cousin once removed, the ninth and ({{as of|2011}}) present holder of the title. He is the great-grandson of Hon. Richard Thomas Rowley, second son of the first Baron, who married the Shipley-Conwy heiress, Charlotte. Lord Langford is Constable of [[Rhuddlan Castle]] and Lord of the Manor of Rhuddlan. As a descendant of the first Earl of Bective, he is also in remainder to the earldom of Bective, the viscountcy of Headfort, the barony of Headfort and the baronetcy of Kells, titles held by his kinsman the [[Marquess of Headfort]].

The family seat is Bodrhyddan Hall [http://www.bodrhyddan.co.uk/], [[Clwyd]], [[Wales]]. The original family seat was Summerhill House, [[County Meath|Meath]], [[Ireland]].
