        text="&lt;p&gt;[[Image:William Denison, 1st Earl of Londesborough.jpg|right|175px|thumb|William Denison, &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;1st Earl of Londesborough.]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Londesborough&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Londesborough in the East Riding of the County of York, is a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created in 1850 for the diplomat and [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig]] politician [[Albert Denison, 1st Baron Londesborough|Lord Albert Denison]]. He was the third son of [[Henry Conyngham, 1st Marquess Conyngham]], and his wife [[Elizabeth Conyngham, Marchioness Conyngham|Elizabeth Denison]]. Born Albert Denison Conyngham, he assumed by Royal license the surname of Denison in lieu of Conyngham in 1849 on inheriting the vast fortune of his maternal uncle William Joseph Denison (1770–1849). Before his elevation to the peerage, Denison had represented [[Canterbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Canterbury]] in Parliament. His eldest son, the second Baron, sat as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Beverley (UK Parliament constituency)|Beverley]] and [[Scarborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Scarborough]]. In 1887 he was created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscount Raincliffe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Raincliffe in the North Riding of the County of York, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earl of Londesborough&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in the County of York. These titles were also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. However, the viscountcy and earldom became extinct on the death of his grandson, the fourth Earl, in 1937.

The barony was inherited by the late Earl&amp;apos;s second cousin once removed, the sixth Baron. He was the son of Rear-Admiral the Hon. Albert Denison, second son of the first Baron. On his death this line of the family failed, and the title passed to his first cousin, the seventh Baron. He was the only son of Commander the Hon. Conyngham Albert Denison, fourth son of the first Baron. When he died this line of the family also failed. He was succeeded by his first cousin, the eighth Baron. He was the only son of the Hon. Harold Albert Denison, fifth son of the first Baron. {{As of|2010}} the title is held by his only son, the ninth Baron, who succeeded in 1968. As a male-line descendant of the first Marquess Conyngham, he is also in remainder to this peerage and its subsidiary titles.
