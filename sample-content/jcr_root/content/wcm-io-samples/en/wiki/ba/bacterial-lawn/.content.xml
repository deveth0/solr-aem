[[Image:Bacterial lawn 01.jpg|thumb|right|A bacterial lawn used in antibiotic resistance testing.]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bacterial lawn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a term used by [[microbiologist]]s to describe the appearance of [[bacteria]]l [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] when all the individual colonies on a petri-dish [[agar plate]] merge to form a field or mat of bacteria. Bacterial lawns find use in screens for [[antibiotic resistance]] and [[bacteriophage]] titering.

Bacterial lawns (often of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Serratia marcescens]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)  are also used extensively when as an assay method when using [[bacteriophage]] as tracers in studies of groundwater flow.

Although occasionally used as a synonym for [[biofilm]], the term primarily applies to the simple, clonal, unstructured mats of organisms that typically only form on laboratory growth media. Biofilms&amp;amp;mdash;the aggregated form of [[microorganism]]s most commonly found in [[nature]]&amp;amp;mdash; are generally more complex and diverse and marked by larger quantities of extracellular structural matrix relative to the cellular [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].

== Techniques ==
Bacterial lawns can be produced manually by evenly spreading a high amount of bacteria onto an agar plate using a sterile [[cotton swab]]. Alternatively an automated machine can be used such as a [[spiral plater]] where the plate is rotated and the sample is spread evenly using an automated dispenser.
