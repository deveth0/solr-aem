&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Carbery&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of [[Barony of Carbery|Carbery]] in the County of Cork, is a title in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]. It was created in 1715 for [[George Evans, 1st Baron Carbery|George Evans]], with remainder to the heirs male of his father and namesake George Evans, a supporter of [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] during the [[Glorious Revolution]], who had earlier declined the offer of a [[peerage]]. After his elevation to the peerage Lord Carbery represented [[Westbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Westbury]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He also sat as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Westbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Westbury]]. His grandson, the fourth Baron, briefly represented [[Rutland (UK Parliament constituency)|Rutland]] in Parliament. He was succeeded by his uncle, the fifth Baron. On his death the line of the eldest son of the first Baron failed. He was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the sixth Baron, who had previously succeeded his father as second Baronet, of Castle Freke (see below). Lord Carbery sat in the [[British House of Lords|House of Lords]] as an [[Representative peer|Irish Representative Peer]] from 1824 to 1845. His nephew, the eighth Baron, was an Irish Representative Peer from 1891 to 1894. {{As of|2012}} the titles are held by the latter&amp;apos;s great-great-grandson, the twelfth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2012.

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baronetcy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Castle Freke in the County of Cork, was created in the [[Baronetage of Ireland]] in 1768 for John Evans-Freke, son of Grace daughter and heiress of Sir [[Ralph Freke]],  [[Freke baronets|1st Baronet of West Bilney Norfolk]]&amp;lt;ref name=JBB&amp;gt;John Burke, Sir Bernard Burke, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1841 London&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and the Hon. John Evans, younger son of the first Baron Carbery. On his death the title passed to his son, the second Baronet. In 1807 he succeeded his first cousin once removed as sixth Baron Carbery. The titles have remained united since.
