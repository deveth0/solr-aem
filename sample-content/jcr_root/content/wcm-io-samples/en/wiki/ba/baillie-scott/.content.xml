&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (23 October 1865 &amp;amp;ndash; 10 February 1945), son of a wealthy Scottish landowner, was a [[United Kingdom|British]] architect and artist. Through his long career, he designed in a variety of styles, including a style derived from the Tudor, an Arts &amp;amp; Crafts style reminiscent of [[Charles_Voysey_(architect)|Voysey]] and later the Neo-Georgian.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Davey&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |last=Davey |first=Peter |title=Arts and Crafts Architecture |year=1999 | origyear=1980 | publisher=Phaidon |location=London |isbn=0 7148 3711 3}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Baillie Scott was born at Beards Hill, St Peters near [[Ramsgate]], [[Kent]], the second of ten children. He originally studied at the [[Royal Agricultural College]] in [[Cirencester]], but, having qualified in 1885, he decided to study architecture instead.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Davey&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; He studied briefly in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], but his architectural development was especially marked by the 12 years he spent living in the [[Isle of Man]]. The first four years of this time he lived at Alexander Terrace, [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]]. In 1893, he and his family moved to Red House, Victoria Road, Douglas, which he had designed.

At the beginning of his career, Baillie Scott worked with Fred Saunders, with whom he had studied at the [[Isle of Man School of Art]], which is also in Douglas. In May 1891, he was an art teacher. It was at the school of art that Baillie Scott and [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]] became friends. He then left Saunders and set up his own business in 23 Athol Street, Douglas. In 1894, in an article in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Studio (magazine)|The Studio]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, he proposed a design having a high central hall with a [[Minstrels&amp;apos;_gallery|galleried]] [[inglenook]] between the drawing and dining rooms and separated from them by [[folding screen]]s. This hypothetical &amp;apos;ideal house&amp;apos; brought in many commissions.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Davey&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

Baillie Scott developed his own unique [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] style however, which progressed towards a simple form of architecture, relying on truth to material and function, and on precise craftsmanship.

Baillie Scott was known for the work he put into both the exterior and the interior, and its decoration. He produced nearly 300 buildings over the course of his career, including Red House, Isle of Man; Majestic Hotel, [[Onchan]], Isle of Man; [[Blackwell (historic house)|Blackwell]], [[Bowness-on-Windermere|Bowness]], Cumbria; Woodbury Hollow, [[Loughton]], Essex; Winscombe House, Crowborough, Sussex; and Oakhams in 1942.

Baillie Scott died at the Elm Grove Hospital in [[Brighton]]. His gravestone in [[Edenbridge, Kent]] reads: &amp;quot;Nature he loved and next to nature art&amp;quot;.
