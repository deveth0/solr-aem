        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Shulbrede in the County of [[Sussex]], is a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created in 1930 for the politician [[Arthur Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede|Arthur Ponsonby]]. Ponsonby was the third son of General [[Henry Ponsonby|Sir Henry Ponsonby]] and the great-grandson of [[Frederick Ponsonby, 3rd Earl of Bessborough]]. [[Frederick Ponsonby, 1st Baron Sysonby]], was his elder brother. The first Baron&amp;apos;s grandson, the third Baron, was also a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician and notably served as [[Opposition Chief Whip]] in the [[House of Lords]] in the 1980s. {{As of|2010}} the title is held by the latter&amp;apos;s only son, the fourth Baron, who succeeded in 1990. He sat on the Labour benches in the House of Lords prior to the passing of the [[House of Lords Act 1999]], when he lost his seat. However, in 2000 he was given a life peerage as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Ponsonby of Roehampton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Shulbrede in the County of [[West Sussex]], and was able to retake his seat in the House of Lords. As a descendant of the third [[Earl of Bessborough]], he is also in remainder to this peerage and its subsidiary titles.
