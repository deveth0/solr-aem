A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;bathymetric chart&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the submerged equivalent of an above-water [[topographic map]]. Bathymetric charts are designed to present accurate, measurable description and visual presentation of the submerged terrain.

In an ideal case, the joining of a bathymetric chart and topographic map of the same [[Scale (measurement)|scale]] and [[Map projection|projection]] of the same geographic area would be seamless. The only difference would be that the values begin increasing after crossing the zero at the designated [[sea level]] [[datum (geodesy)|datum]]. Thus the topographic map&amp;apos;s [[mountain]]s have the greatest values while the bathymetric chart&amp;apos;s greatest depths have the greatest values. Simply put, the bathymetric chart is intended to show the land if overlying waters were removed in exactly the same manner as the topographic map.

A bathymetric chart differs from a [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] chart in that accurate presentation of the underwater features is the goal while safe [[navigation]] is the requirement for the hydrographic chart. A [[hydrographic chart]] will obscure the actual features to present a simplified version to aid [[sailor|mariners]] in avoiding underwater hazards.

Bathymetric surveys are a [[subset]] of the science of [[hydrography]]. They differ slightly from the [[Hydrographic survey|survey]]s required to produce the product of hydrography in its more limited application and as conducted by the national and international agencies tasked with producing [[chart]]s and [[publication]]s for safe navigation. That chart product is more accurately termed a navigation or hydrographic chart with a strong bias toward the presentation of essential safety information.

Bathymetric surveys and charts are more closely tied to the science of [[oceanography]], particularly [[marine geology]], and [[underwater engineering]] or other specialized purposes.

Bathymetric charts can also be converted to [[topographic profile|bathymetric profiles]].
