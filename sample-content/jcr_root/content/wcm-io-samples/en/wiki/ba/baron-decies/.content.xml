&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Decies&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Decies in the County of Waterford, is a title in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]. It was created in 1812 for the Right Reverend [[William Beresford, 1st Baron Decies|William Beresford]], [[Church of Ireland Archdiocese of Tuam|Archbishop of Tuam]] from 1794 to 1819. He was the third son of the [[Marcus Beresford, 1st Earl of Tyrone]], and the younger brother of the [[George Beresford, 1st Marquess of Waterford]]. His son, the second Baron, married Charlotta Philadelphia Horsley, only daughter and heiress of Robert Horsley, and assumed the additional surname of Horsley in 1810. However, none of the subsequent barons have held this surname. His grandson, the fifth Baron, was a Major in the Army and also sat in the [[House of Lords]] as an [[Representative peer|Irish Representative Peer]] from 1912 to 1944. {{As of|2010}} the title is held by his grandson, the seventh Baron, who succeeded his father in 1992. As a descendant of the first Earl of Tyrone he is also in remainder to this peerage and its subsidiary titles, which are now held by his kinsman the Marquess of Waterford.
