[[Image:WorcesterMassBar.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;bar&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (with swinging gate doors) in an [[United States|American]] [[courtroom]] that separates the [[judge]]&amp;apos;s [[bench (law)|bench]] and [[lawyer]]s&amp;apos; tables from the public viewing area in the foreground. The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;bar&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is also a [[metonymy|metonym]] used to collectively define the group of [[licensure|licensed]] lawyers in a given [[jurisdiction]].]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in a [[law|legal]] context has three possible meanings: the physical division of a courtroom between its working and public areas; the process of qualifying to [[law practice|practice law]]; and the legal profession.

==Courtroom division==
[[Image:Bar at the Rhode Island Supreme Court.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The bar (railing) at the [[Rhode Island Supreme Court]]]]
The origin of the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;bar&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is from the barring furniture dividing a medieval European courtroom, similarly as the origin of the term [[bank]] for the location of financial transactions in medieval Europe. In the USA, Europe and many other countries referring to the law traditions of Europe, the area in front of the barrage is restricted to participants in the trial: the [[judge]] or judges, other court officials, the jury (if any), the lawyers for each party, the parties to the case, and witnesses giving testimony. The area behind the bar is open to the public.&amp;lt;ref name=blacks&amp;gt;

==License and certification==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The bar&amp;apos;&amp;apos; may also refer to the qualifying procedure by which a lawyer is licensed to practice law in a given jurisdiction.

===U.S. procedure===
{{main|Admission to the bar in the United States}}
In the United States, this procedure is administered by the individual [[U.S. state]]s. In general, a candidate must graduate from a qualified [[law school]] and pass a written test: the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[bar examination]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Nearly all states use the [[Multistate Bar Examination]], usually with additions for that state&amp;apos;s laws. The candidate is then &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. A lawyer whose license to practice law is revoked is said to be &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[disbarment|disbarred]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

===British procedure===
{{main|Call to the bar}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], the practice of law is divided between [[solicitors]] and [[barristers]] ([[Advocates#Advocates in Scotland|advocates]] in [[Scotland]]).  It is the latter who appear in court.  When a lawyer becomes a barrister, he is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Call to the bar|called to the bar]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==The legal profession==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Bar&amp;apos;&amp;apos; commonly refers to the legal profession as a whole. With a modifier, it may refer to a branch or division of the profession: as for instance, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[tort]] bar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, lawyers who specialize in filing [[Lawsuit|civil suits]] for damages.

In conjunction with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;bench&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;bar&amp;apos;&amp;apos; may differentiate lawyers who represent clients (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;the bar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), from judges or members of a [[judiciary]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bench (law)|the bench]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). In this sense, the bar advocates and the bench adjudicates.  Yet, judges commonly remain members of the bar; and lawyers are commonly referenced as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Officers of the Court&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The phrase &amp;apos;&amp;apos;bench and bar&amp;apos;&amp;apos; denotes all judges and lawyers collectively.&amp;lt;ref name=Walker/&amp;gt;
