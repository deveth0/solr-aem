The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Barmy Army&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a semi-organised group of [[English people|English]] [[cricket]] [[fan (aficionado)|fan]]s which arranges touring parties for some of its members to follow the [[English cricket team]] on overseas tours. The name is also applied to followers of the team who join in with match day activities in the crowd, but do not necessarily travel as part of an organised tour.

The group, then less organised, was given its name by the Australian media during the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1994-95|1994 - 1995]] [[Test cricket|Test]] series in [[Australia]], reportedly for the fans&amp;apos; audacity in travelling to Australia in the near-certain knowledge that their team would lose, and the fact that they kept on chanting even when England were losing quite badly.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Staff.

==History==
The Barmy Army, which is a limited company, claims it wants to &amp;quot;make watching cricket more fun and much more popular&amp;quot;. The group uses [[flag]]s, [[banner]]s, [[song]]s and [[chant]]s to encourage the team and crowd participation in their activities. In contrast to the reputations of some sports fans for [[hooliganism]], the Barmy Army organisers actively discourage such behaviour.

The group engages in [[Charitable organization|charity]] work, and has a good reputation among cricket administrators and among some other fans. However, some cricket followers find the chanting of the Barmy Army to be annoying, lowbrow and disruptive and veteran cricket writer/commentator [[Christopher Martin-Jenkins]] has accused the Army of &amp;quot;demeaning English cricket&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Christopher Martin-Jenkins.

&amp;quot;Barmy Army&amp;quot; was a football chant sung by fans at many grounds, originally sang at Hillsborough by [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the early 1980s. In conjunction with the increasing appearance of English football shirts at cricket grounds in the early 1990s, the song&amp;apos;s repetitive cry of &amp;quot;Barmy Army, Barmy Army, Barmy Army&amp;quot; transferred to domestic cricket arenas at [[Old Trafford (cricket ground)|Old Trafford]] and [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]]. It was particularly apparent during the 1993 [[The Ashes|Ashes]] tour.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&amp;lt;!--whole paragraph--&amp;gt;

Throughout the 1990s, increased spending power, via a stronger British Pound at the time, enabled fans to take the song overseas when following tours of the English national cricket team. Because of that particular song, and the fact that it seemed to represent English fans&amp;apos; activity of standing in the hot sun drinking lager all day, it became a description as well as a song. [[David Lloyd (cricketer)|David Lloyd]] and [[Ian Botham]] used the tag to describe the supporters whilst commentating for [[Sky Sports]] during England&amp;apos;s tours from 1993 to 1995.

Only in the mid-1990s was the tag recognised as an official title for English touring cricket fans and adopted by what is now recognised as the official Barmy Army.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&amp;lt;!--For the whole paragraph--&amp;gt; Some regard the Barmy Army&amp;apos;s unofficial leader to be [[Vic Flowers]].
