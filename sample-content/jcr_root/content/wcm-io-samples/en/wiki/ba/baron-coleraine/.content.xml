&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Coleraine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a title that has been created three times, twice in the [[Peerage of Ireland]] and once in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. The first creation came in the Peerage of Ireland in 1625 for the courtier [[Hugh Hare, 1st Baron Coleraine|Hugh Hare]]. This creation became extinct on the death of the third Baron in 1749.

The third Baron represented [[East_Retford_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|East Retford]], [[Aldborough_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|Aldborough]] and [[Mitchell_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|Mitchell]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The fourth Baron was a soldier, politician and eccentric. The title became extinct on his death in 1824.
