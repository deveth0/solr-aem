&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Paige&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Detroit]], [[United States]] based [[automobile]] company, selling luxury cars between 1908 and 1927.

==History==

[[Image:Paige-detroit 1911-1022.jpg|thumb|left|1911 Paige-Detroit Roadster - Syracuse Herald, October 22, 1911]]

The first car in 1908 was called a [[Paige-Detroit]] and was a two-seat model powered by a 2.2-liter three-cylinder, [[two-stroke]] engine. In 1910 [[Four-stroke cycle|four-stroke]], four-cylinder models took over, and in 1911 the name was changed to Paige. A six-cylinder model was added to the range in 1914. Four-cylinder models were dropped in 1916, leaving a choice of 3.7- or 4.9-liter sixes. A straight-eight engine was added to the sixes in 1927.

Probably the most famous Paige was the 1922 to 1926 Daytona, a sporting 3-seat roadster with a 6-liter engine. The third seat pulled out from the side of the car over the near side [[running board]]. Paige advertised it as being &amp;quot;The most beautiful car in America&amp;quot;.

Paige also made a cheaper range of cars between 1923 and 1926 and sold as [[Jewett (automobile)|Jewett]]s named after H M Jewett the company president. For 1927, this car was sold as a junior Paige.

==Company sold==

The Graham Brothers bought the company on June 10, 1927. Joseph Graham became the new president, his brothers Robert and Ray serving as vice-president and secretary-treasurer, respectively. The three, together with their father, also became directors of the company. The corporate name soon changed to Graham-Paige Motors Corporation. The market agreed, and automobile production rose from 21,881 in 1927 to 73,195 for the following year, when the cars became known as [[Graham-Paige]]s.

When the second series of 1930 cars was released (bringing out two series for a model year was widely practised at the time), the name for the product (but not for the corporate name) changed to just &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Graham&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;“The Graham Brothers and Their Car” by Jeffery I. Godshall; Automobile Quarterly Volume 13 No.1&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
