&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pandarus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a Trojan aristocrat who appears in stories about the [[Trojan War]]. In Homer&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Iliad]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; he is portrayed as an energetic and impetuous warrior, but in medieval literature he becomes a witty and licentious figure who facilitates the affair between [[Troilus]] and [[Cressida]]. In Shakespeare&amp;apos;s play &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Troilus and Cressida]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; he is portrayed as an aged degenerate and coward, who ends the play by telling the audience he will bequeath them his &amp;quot;diseases&amp;quot;.

==Classical literature==
In Homer&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Iliad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pandarus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pandaros&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Πάνδαρος) is a famous archer and the son of [[Lycaon (son of Priam)|Lycaon]]. Pandarus, who fights on the side of [[Troy]] in the [[Trojan War]], first appears in Book Two of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Iliad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In Book Four, he shoots [[Menelaus]] and wounds him with an arrow, sabotaging a truce that could potentially have led to the peaceful return of [[Helen of Troy]].  He is goaded into breaking the truce by the gods, who wish for the destruction of Troy.  He then wounds [[Diomedes]] with an arrow and acts as [[Aeneas]]&amp;apos; charioteer. He is later killed by Diomedes, whose spear strikes him in the face, severing his tongue.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pandarus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is also the name of a companion of [[Aeneas]] in [[Virgil]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Aeneid]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Pandarus is not to be confused with [[Pandareus]].

==Later literature==
Pandarus appears in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Il Filostrato]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], in which he plays the role of a go-between in the relationship of his cousin Criseyde and the Trojan prince Troilus, the younger brother of Paris and Hector. Bocaccio himself derived the story from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Le Roman De Troie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, by 12th century poet [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]]. This story is not part of [[Greek mythology|classical Greek mythology]]. Both Pandarus and other characters in the medieval narrative who carry names from the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Iliad]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are quite different from Homer&amp;apos;s characters of the same name.

In [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]’s poem &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Troilus and Criseyde]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1370), Pandarus plays the same role; though Chaucer&amp;apos;s Pandarus is Criseyde&amp;apos;s uncle, not her cousin.  Chaucer&amp;apos;s Pandarus is of special interest because he is constructed as an expert rhetorician, who uses dozens of proverbs and proverbial sayings to bring the lovers Troilus and Criseyde together. When his linguistic fireworks fail at the end of the story, the proverb and human rhetoric in general are questioned as reliable means of communication.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Richard Utz, &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sic et Non&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: Zu Funktion und Epistemologie des Sprichwortes bei Geoffrey Chaucer,” &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Das Mittelalter: Perspektiven mediävistischer Forschung&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 2.2 (1997), 31-43.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[William Shakespeare]] used the medieval story again in his play &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Troilus and Cressida]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1609).  Shakespeare&amp;apos;s Pandarus is more of a bawd than Chaucer&amp;apos;s, and he is a lecherous and degenerate individual.

In &amp;quot;[[The Duke&amp;apos;s Children]]&amp;quot; by [[Anthony Trollope]] when the Duke of Omnium suspects Mrs Finn of encouraging his daughter&amp;apos;s romance he refers to her as a &amp;apos;she-Pandarus&amp;apos;.

==Pandering==
The plot function of the aging lech Pandarus in Chaucer&amp;apos;s and Shakespeare&amp;apos;s famous works has given rise to the English terms &amp;apos;&amp;apos;a pander&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (in later usage &amp;apos;&amp;apos;a panderer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), from Chaucer, meaning a person who furthers other people&amp;apos;s illicit sexual amours; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;to pander&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, from Shakespeare, as a verb denoting the same activity. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A panderer&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is, specifically, a bawd — a male who arranges access to female sexual favors, the manager of prostitutes.  Thus, in law, the charge of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[procuring (prostitution)|pandering]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an accusation that an individual has sold the sexual services of another. The verb &amp;quot;to pander&amp;quot; is also used in a more general sense to suggest active or implicit encouragement of someone&amp;apos;s weaknesses.
