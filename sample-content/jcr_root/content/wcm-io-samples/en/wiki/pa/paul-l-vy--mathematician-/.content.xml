&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Paul Pierre Lévy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (15 September 1886 – 15 December 1971)&amp;lt;ref name=mactutor&amp;gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Levy_Paul}}
&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was a  [[France|French]] mathematician who was active especially in [[probability theory]], introducing [[martingale (probability theory)|martingale]]s and [[Lévy flight]]s.  [[Lévy process]]es, [[Lévy measure]]s, [[Lévy&amp;apos;s constant]], the [[Lévy distribution]], the [[Lévy skew alpha-stable distribution]], the [[Lévy area]], the [[Lévy arcsine law]], and the [[fractal]] [[Lévy C curve]] are also named after him.

Lévy was born in [[Paris]], the son of Lucien Lévy, an Examiner at the [[École Polytechnique]]. Lévy also attended the École Polytechnique and published his first paper in 1905 at the age of 19, while still an undergraduate.  His teacher and advisor was [[Jacques Hadamard]].  After graduation he spent a year in military service and then studied for three years at the [[École des Mines]], where he became a professor in 1913.&amp;lt;ref name=mactutor /&amp;gt;

During [[World War I]] Lévy conducted mathematical analysis work for the French artillery. In 1920 he was appointed Professor of Analysis at the École Polytechnique, where his students included [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] and [[Georges Matheron]]. He remained at the École Polytechnique until his retirement in 1959, with a gap during World War II after his 1940 firing because of the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] [[Statute on Jews]].&amp;lt;ref name=mactutor /&amp;gt;

Lévy received a number of honors, including membership at the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and honorary membership at the [[London Mathematical Society]].&amp;lt;ref name=mactutor /&amp;gt;
