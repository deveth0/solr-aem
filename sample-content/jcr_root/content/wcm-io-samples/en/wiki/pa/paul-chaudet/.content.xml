&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Paul Chaudet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (November 17, 1904 - August 7, 1977) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] politician.

He was elected to the [[Swiss Federal Council]] on December 16, 1954 and handed over office on December 31, 1966. He resigned on November 28, 1966 due to the Mirage-affair. He was affiliated to the [[Radical Party (Switzerland)|Radical Party]]. During his office time he held the [[Military Department (Switzerland)|Military Department]].

He was [[President of the Confederation (Switzerland)|President of the Confederation]] twice in 1959 and 1962.

Owing to incompetent military advisors concerning the purchase of 100 Mirage fighter jets with a budget which increased by 66% he was forced to resign in 1966, by his own Radical Party.

With Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, he was probably one of the last true Swiss Radicals. He remained, throughout his life, one of the rare right wing Swiss politicians who was able to identify with both wine-growers and farmers.

The Radical Party has now fused with the right-wing Liberals.
