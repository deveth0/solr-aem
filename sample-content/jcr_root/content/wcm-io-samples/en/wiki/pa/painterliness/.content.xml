[[File:Matisse - Vase of Sunflowers (1898).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henri Matisse]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vase of Sunflowers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1898–1899, [[State Hermitage Museum]] [[Saint Petersburg, Russia]].]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Painterliness&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a concept based on the [[German language|German]] term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{lang|de|malerisch}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (painterly), a word popularized by Swiss [[art historian]] [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945) in order to help focus, enrich and standardize the terms being used by art historians of his time to characterize [[Work of art|works of art]].  It is the opposite of [[Linear (art)|linear]], plastic or formal linear design.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;For further clarification of the meaning of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;malerisch&amp;apos;&amp;apos; read &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Francis Bacon: Logic of Sensation&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Gilles Deleuze]].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

An [[oil painting]] is painterly when there are visible [[Brush#Paintbrushes|brushstroke]]s, the result of applying paint in a less than completely controlled manner, generally without closely following carefully drawn lines. Works characterized as either painterly or linear can be produced with any painting media, oils, acrylics, watercolors, gouache, etc. Some artists whose work could be characterized as painterly are [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], and [[John Singer Sargent]]. In watercolor it might be represented by the early watercolors of [[Andrew Wyeth]].

In contrast, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;linear&amp;apos;&amp;apos; could describe the painting of artists such as [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], whose works depend on creating the illusion of a degree of [[three-dimensional]]ity by means of &amp;quot;modeling the form&amp;quot; through skillful drawing, shading, and an academic rather than impulsive use of color. Contour and pattern are more in the province of the linear artists, while dynamism is the most common trait of painterly works.

The [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] and the [[Abstract Expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]] tended strongly to be painterly movements. Both [[Pop Art]] and [[photo-realism]], due to their dependence on photographic imagery, were characterized by an absence of apparent brushstrokes.

Painterly art often makes use of the many visual effects produced by paint on canvas such as chromatic progression, warm and cool tones, [[Color wheel|complementary and contrasting colors]], broken tones, broad brushstrokes, [[Sketch (drawing)|sketchiness]], and [[impasto]].

==Other usage==
Although &amp;apos;&amp;apos;painterly&amp;apos;&amp;apos; generally refers to a certain use of paint in art, it happens that some forms of [[sculpture]] make use of apparently random surface effects which, if not exactly resembling brushstrokes, contain the traits of painterliness (see [[Wood as a medium]]).{{fact|date=April 2012}} The application of the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;painterly&amp;apos;&amp;apos; outside of painting may help the viewer or listener experience more deeply the significance of [[Auguste Rodin]]&amp;apos;s surfaces or [[Richard Strauss]]&amp;apos;s flow of chromatic harmonies.
