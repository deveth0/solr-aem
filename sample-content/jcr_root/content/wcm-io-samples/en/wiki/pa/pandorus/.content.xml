In [[Greek mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pandorus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a son of [[Erichthonius II of Athens]] and [[Praxithea]].  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pandorus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was also the sibling of [[Metion]] and [[Cecrops]].
Pandorus was a very accomplished archer who fought in Homer&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Iliad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Typically archers were seen as inferior soldiers compared to swordsmen. In Book IV, he was persuaded by Minerva to break the truce by firing an arrow at &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Menalaus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He did his job, and incited Agamemnon to rouse his troops. He is later wounded in Book XI when &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ajax&amp;apos;&amp;apos; goes on a great rampage.
