&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pasture&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (from the Latin &amp;apos;&amp;apos;pastus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, past participle of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;pascere&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ”to feed”) is land used for [[grazing]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|pasture}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Pasture lands in the narrow sense are enclosed tracts of [[farmland]], grazed by domesticated [[livestock]], such as [[horse]]s, [[cattle]], [[sheep]] or [[swine]]. The vegetation of tended pasture, [[forage]], consists mainly of [[grasses]], with an interspersion of [[legume]]s and other [[forb]]s. Pasture is typically grazed throughout the summer, in  contrast to [[meadow]] which is used for grazing only after being [[mowing|mown]] to make [[hay]] for winter [[fodder]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite NIE|Pasture|year=1905}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Pasture in a wider sense additionally includes [[rangeland]]s, other unenclosed [[pastoralism|pastoral system]]s and land types used by wild animals for [[grazing]] or [[browsing (predation)|browsing]].

Pasture lands in the narrow sense are distinguished from rangelands by being managed through more intensive agricultural practices of [[seeding]], [[irrigation]], and the use of [[fertilizer]]s, while rangelands grow primarily native vegetation, managed with extensive practices like [[controlled burn]]ing and regulated intensity of grazing.

[[Soil]] type, minimum annual [[temperature]], and [[rainfall]] are important factors in pasture management.

Sheepwalk is an area of [[grassland]] where sheep can roam freely. The productivity of sheepwalk is measured by the number of sheep per area. This is dependent, among other things, on the underlying rock.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;R. Elfyn Hughes, &amp;quot;Sheep Population and Environment in Snowdonia (North Wales)&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Journal of Ecology&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Vol. 46, No. 1, Mar., 1958, 169-189&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Sheepwalk is also the name of townlands in [[County Roscommon]], [[Ireland]] and [[County Fermanagh]], [[Northern Ireland]].

Prior to the advent of [[factory farming]] with its use of &amp;quot;[[zero-grazing]]&amp;quot; feeding techniques, pasture was the primary source of food for grazing animals such as [[cattle]] and [[horse]]s. It is still used extensively, particularly in arid regions where pasture land is unsuitable for any other [[agricultural production]]. In more humid regions, pasture grazing is exploited extensively for [[free range]] and [[organic farming]]. It is an important biotic resource.
