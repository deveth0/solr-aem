        text="&lt;p&gt;In [[Hawaiian mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pakaʻa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the god of the [[wind]] and the inventor of the [[sail]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Memoirs of the [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop]] Museum of Polynesian Ethnology and Natural History, Volume 5&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the legend, Pakaʻa was the child of a traveling royal named Kuanuʻuanu and a beautiful common woman named Laʻamaomao. Kuanu&amp;apos;uanu was summoned back to his leige [[Keawenuiaumi]] before Pakaʻa&amp;apos;s birth. Paka&amp;apos;a was then raised by La&amp;apos;amaomao and her elder brother Maʻilou, who Pakaʻa was told was his father. Paka&amp;apos;a however questioned this, because despite his young age, he was much taller than Maʻilou.

He then went traveling with the king of [[kauai|Kauaʻi]], Pai&amp;apos;ea, to the other [[Hawaiian Islands]], taking the Gord of Laʻamaomao, which gave him control over the many winds of Hawaii.

He later served under Keawenuiaumi and taught his son, Kuapakaʻa (or Ku-A-Pakaʻa) to follow in his footsteps.
