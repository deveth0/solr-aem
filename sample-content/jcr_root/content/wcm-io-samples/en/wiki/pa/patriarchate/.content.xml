        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;patriarchate&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the [[office]] or [[Jurisdiction#Executive jurisdiction|jurisdiction]] of a [[patriarch]]. A patriarch, as the term is used here, is either

* one of the highest-ranking [[bishop]]s in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], earlier, the five that were included in the [[Pentarchy]]: [[Rome]], [[Constantinople]], [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], and [[Jerusalem]], but now nine, excluding Rome and including patriarchs of [[Serbia]], [[Russia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]; or

* one of ten&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Annuario Pontificio]] 2012, pp. 3-8. The title of &amp;quot;Patriarch of the West&amp;quot; for the Pope is no longer in use.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; high-ranking&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;In his motu proprio [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19650211_ad-purpuratorum_lt.html &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ad Purpuratorum Patrum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of 11 February 1965, [[Pope Paul VI]] decreed that Eastern Catholic Patriarchs who became cardinals would be ranked as Cardinal Bishops, not Cardinal Priests, as had previously been the case, and that they would yield precedence only to the six Cardinal Bishops who hold the titles of the suburbicarian sees.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; bishops of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]]: seven &amp;quot;[[patriarchs of the east]]&amp;quot; (six who are heads of [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]]), and the Patriarchs of [[Patriarch of Lisbon|Lisbon]], [[Patriarch of Venice|Venice]], and the [[Patriarch of the East Indies|East Indies]]; or

* one of the specific patriarchs of the various [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] churches.

The five patriarchs of the [[Pentarchy]] sat in [[Rome]], [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]), [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], and [[Jerusalem]]. The [[East-West Schism]] of 1054 split the Latin-speaking see of Rome from the four Greek-speaking patriarchates, forming distinct &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Roman Catholic&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eastern Orthodox&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Churches. The [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Patriarch of Antioch]] moved to [[Damascus]] in the 13th century, during the reign of the [[Egypt]]ian [[Mamluk|Mamelukes]], conquerors of [[Syria]]. In Damascus a Christian community had flourished since [[Apostolic Age|apostolic]] times ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 9). However, the patriarchate is still called the Patriarchate of Antioch, somewhat similar to continuance of the name &amp;quot;[[Patriarchate of Constantinople]]&amp;quot;. Damascus is the seat also of the Syrian Catholic and the Melkite Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch, while the Maronite Catholic of Antioch lives in Bkerké, Lebanon.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Annuario Pontificio 2012, pp. 3-5&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The four early Orthodox patriarchates of the East, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, along with their counterpart in the West, Rome, are distinguished{{by whom?|date=May 2012}} as &amp;quot;senior&amp;quot; ([[Greek_language|Greek]]: πρεσβυγενή, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;presbygenē&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;senior-born&amp;quot;) or &amp;quot;ancient&amp;quot; (παλαίφατα, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;palaíphata&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;of ancient fame&amp;quot;) and are among the [[apostolic see]]s, having had one of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] or [[Four_Evangelists|Evangelists]] as their first bishop: [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Saint_Peter|Peter]], [[James the Just|James]], and [[Saint_Peter|Peter]] again, respectively.

A patriarchate has [[Juristic person|&amp;quot;legal personality&amp;quot;]] in some legal [[Jurisdiction#Power of a court of law|jurisdictions]], that means it is treated as a [[corporation]]. For example, the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem]] filed a lawsuit in [[New York]], decided in 1999, against [[Christie&amp;apos;s|Christie&amp;apos;s Auction House]], disputing the ownership of the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]].

The head of the [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] is also called a Patriarch.
