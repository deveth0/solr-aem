The winning song in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|competition]] was &amp;quot;[[Rock &amp;apos;n&amp;apos; Roll Kids]]&amp;quot;.  The music and [[lyrics]] for the song were written by [[Brendan Graham]].  Harrington and McGettigan were the first group in Eurovision history to have been awarded more than 200 points (226), and their win was the third consecutive for Ireland, representing the first [[hat trick]] to have been achieved by any nation. Harrington returned to Eurovision in 1998, backing Dawn Martin when she performed &amp;quot;Is Always Over Now&amp;quot; at the contest in Birmingham. He was not named at the contest as one of the performers.

In [[1991 in music|1991]], Harrington released an album entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;What I&amp;apos;d Say&amp;apos;&amp;apos; comprising twelve tracks, of which he wrote or co-wrote five.  The album was released on the Eaton Records label.

Harrington performed as a vocalist in the [[Michael Flatley]] production &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Celtic Tiger&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and performs on the Irish [[radio station]] [[RTÉ 2fm]] and occasionally on the Irish television network [[Radio Telefís Éireann]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In May 2008 Harrington released &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Collection&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, an 18 track compilation of Paul&amp;apos;s favorite recordings.  It included a new version if &amp;quot;What I&amp;apos;d Say&amp;quot; which he debuted on RTÉ&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Late Late Show&amp;quot;. It also included a recording of Harold Melvin And The Blue Notes&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Wake up Everybody&amp;quot; which was intended to be released as a single in Oct 2008.

In June 2009, Harrington married Karol Sadlier.

In March 2010 Paul releases his album &amp;quot;Songs&amp;quot; which contains new recordings of songs from his favourite songwriters. The album includes versions of &amp;quot;[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just The Way You Are]]&amp;quot; by [[Billy Joel]], &amp;quot;[[Easy]]&amp;quot; by [[Lionel Richie]] and &amp;quot;The Island&amp;quot; by [[Paul Brady]]. The album was produced by [[Chris O&amp;apos; Brien]] and [[Graham Murphy]] and is released on  Stereolex Records.
