The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pacific Plate&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an oceanic [[tectonic plate]] that lies beneath the [[Pacific Ocean]]. At 103 million square kilometres, it is the largest tectonic plate.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ees1.lanl.gov/Wohletz/SFT-Tectonics.htm|title=SFT and the Earth&amp;apos;s Tectonic Plates|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The north-eastern side is a [[divergent boundary]] with the [[Explorer Plate]], the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] and the [[Gorda Plate]] forming respectively the [[Explorer Ridge]], the [[Juan de Fuca Ridge]] and the [[Gorda Ridge]]. In the middle of the eastern side is a [[transform boundary]] with the [[North American Plate]] along the [[San Andreas Fault]], and a boundary with the [[Cocos Plate]]. The south-eastern side is a [[divergent boundary]] with the [[Nazca Plate]] forming the [[East Pacific Rise]].

The southern side is a [[divergent boundary]] with the [[Antarctic Plate]] forming the [[Pacific-Antarctic Ridge]].

The western side, the plate is bounded by the [[Okhotsk Plate]] at the [[Kuril-Kamchatka Trench]] and the [[Japan Trench]], forms a [[convergent boundary]] by subducting under the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] creating the [[Mariana Trench]], has a [[transform boundary]] with the [[Caroline Plate]], and has a collision boundary with the [[North Bismarck Plate]].

In the south-west, the Pacific Plate has a complex but generally convergent boundary with the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], subducting under it north of [[New Zealand]] forming the [[Tonga Trench]] and the [[Kermadec Trench]]. The [[Alpine Fault]] marks a [[transform boundary]] between the two plates, and further south the Indo-Australian Plate subducts under the Pacific Plate forming the [[Puysegur trench|Puysegur Trench]]. The southern part of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], which is to the east of this boundary, is the plate&amp;apos;s largest block of continental crust.

The northern side is a [[convergent boundary]] subducting under the [[North American Plate]] forming the [[Aleutian Trench]] and the corresponding [[Aleutian Islands]].

The Pacific Plate contains an interior [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]] forming the [[Hawaiian Islands]].

Hillis and Müller are reported to consider the [[Bird&amp;apos;s Head Plate]] to be moving in unison with the Pacific Plate.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=Evolution and Dynamics of the Australian Plate |last=Hillis |first=R.

==Paleo-geology of the Pacific Plate==
The Pacific Plate has the distinction of showing one of the largest areal sections of the oldest members of seabed geology being entrenched into eastern Asian [[oceanic trench]]es. A [[geologic map]] of the Pacific Ocean seabed shows not only the geologic sequences, and associated [[Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]] zones on the ocean&amp;apos;s perimeters, but the various ages of the seafloor in a stair-step fashion, youngest to oldest, the oldest being consumed into the Asian oceanic trenches. The oldest member disappearing by way of the [[Plate Tectonics]] cycle is early-[[Cretaceous]] (145 to 137 million years ago).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://wserver.crc.losrios.edu/~jacksoh/Images/crustageposter.gif Age of the Ocean Floor]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

All maps of the Earth&amp;apos;s ocean floor geology show ages younger than 145 million years, only about 1/40 of the Earth&amp;apos;s 4.55 billion year history.
