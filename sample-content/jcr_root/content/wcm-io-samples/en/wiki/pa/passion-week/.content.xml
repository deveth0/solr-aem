        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Passion Week&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a name for the week beginning on [[Passion Sunday]], as the Fifth Sunday of Lent was once called in the [[Roman Rite]].

However, even before [[Pope John XXIII]]&amp;apos;s [[Code of Rubrics]] (1960) changed the name of this Sunday from &amp;quot;Passion Sunday&amp;quot; (Dominica de Passione)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/missale-romanum-pdf.html Missale Romanum, 1920 typical edition], p. 156&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  to &amp;quot;First Sunday of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]&amp;quot; (Dominica I Passionis),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962.pdf Missale Romanum 1962], p. 118&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; the liturgical books gave no special name to this week, referring to the days in it simply as &amp;quot;Monday (etc.) after Passion Sunday&amp;quot;, which in Pope John XXIII&amp;apos;s edition of the [[Roman Missal]] became &amp;quot;Monday (etc.) after the First Sunday of the Passion&amp;quot;.

In Pope John XXIII&amp;apos;s revision, not only the Sunday that had previously had the exclusive name of Passion Sunday but also the following Sunday referred in their names to the Passion. The latter became the &amp;quot;Second Sunday of the Passion or [[Palm Sunday]]&amp;quot; (Dominica II Passionis seu in Palmis).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962.pdf Missale Romanum 1962], p. 130&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The week beginning on that Sunday continued to have a distinctive name, &amp;quot;[[Holy Week]]&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Hebdomada sancta&amp;quot;) (previously, &amp;quot;Great Week&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hebdomada major&amp;quot;, but referred to in English as Holy Week), and the first days in it were called &amp;quot;Monday (etc.) of Holy Week&amp;quot;, not &amp;quot;Monday (etc.) after the Second Sunday of the Passion or Palm Sunday&amp;quot;.

In the 1969 revision, Passiontide ceased to be a separate liturgical season and became the Fifth Week of Lent, followed by Holy Week.

Until the introduction of the new Harmony of the Gospel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Readings for Holy Week&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1969, English-speaking members of the [[Moravian Church]] used the name &amp;quot;Passion Week&amp;quot; for Holy Week, a week much more closely associated with the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]].
