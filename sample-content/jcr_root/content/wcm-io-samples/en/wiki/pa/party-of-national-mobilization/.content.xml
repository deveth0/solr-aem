The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Party of National Mobilization&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-pt|Partido da Mobilização Nacional}}, PMN) is a national-centrist political party in [[Brazil]] founded by politicians from the [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[Minas Gerais]] on April 21, 1984, advocating for [[agrarian reform]], termination of debt payments, ending of relations with the [[International Monetary Fund]] and formation of a [[trade bloc]] with other South American nations.

Due to some problems with the Brazilian Electoral Court, the PMN&amp;apos;s registration was ceased in January 1989. The party restarted in June of the same year. At the legislative [[elections in Brazil]], 6 October 2002, the party won 1 out of 513 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and no seats in the Senate.
From 2002 to 2010, the PMN was one of the members of [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]&amp;apos;s coalition.

At the 2010 elections, the PMN won four  seats in the Chamber of Deputies and won the governorship of the state of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]]. In the Presidential race, the party supported the coalition of [[José Serra]].
