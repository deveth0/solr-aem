[[File:ParabolicMicrophone.jpg|thumb|right|Parabolic microphone used at an American college football game.]] A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;parabolic microphone&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[microphone]] that uses a [[parabolic reflector]] to collect and focus [[sound]] waves onto a receiver, in much the same way that a [[parabolic antenna]] (e.g., [[satellite dish]]) does with [[radio wave]]s.  Typical uses of this microphone, which has unusually focused front sensitivity and can pick up sounds from many metres away, include nature [[sound recording|recording]], field audio for sports broadcasting, [[eavesdropping]] (for example, [[espionage]]), and law enforcement.

Parabolic microphones are generally not used for standard [[sound recording|recording]] applications because they tend to have poor low-frequency response as a side effect of their design.  This is a direct result of the physical laws that govern sound waves.

Parabolas only focus waves with a wavelength much smaller than the diameter of the parabola.
&amp;lt;!-- why? --&amp;gt;
Since sound waves travel at 342&amp;amp;nbsp;m/s through the air ([[speed of sound]]), obtaining hi-fidelity sound (down to 20&amp;amp;nbsp;Hz, the lower limit of human hearing)
would require a parabola with a diameter greater than 17 metres (= 342&amp;amp;nbsp;m/s / 20&amp;amp;nbsp;Hz). Most parabolic microphones sacrifice low-end fidelity to get a more manageable size.
