The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pasadena Star-News&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the local daily newspaper for [[Pasadena, California]]. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Star-News&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a member of the [[Los Angeles Newspaper Group]], since 1996. It is also part of the San Gabriel Valley Newspaper Group, along with the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[San Gabriel Valley Tribune]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Whittier Daily News]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

First published in 1884, the paper was originally located at the corner of Colorado Boulevard and Oakland Avenue for years. That building is now home to [[Le Cordon Bleu|Technique at Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts]] and [[24 Hour Fitness]].

Ridder Newspapers bought the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Star-News&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1956 and [[Bernard J. Ridder]] took over as publisher. Ridder merged with Knight to form [[Knight Ridder]] in 1974. The paper was sold off in 1989 to a company owned by [[William Dean Singleton]]; the [[Thomson Corporation]] bought majority control of the paper a year later. Thomson sold the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Star-News&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to Singleton&amp;apos;s [[MediaNews Group]] in 1996, which went on to become part of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group.

The newspaper also publishes the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rose Magazine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.therosemag.com/issues/parade_2011/ |title=About Us |work=Rose Magazine |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
