[[File:Berthault - Das Volk von Paris vor dem Rathaus.jpg|thumb|[[Hôtel de Ville, Paris]] during the French Revolution]]
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Paris Commune&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; during the [[French Revolution]] was the government  of Paris from 1789 until 1795. Established in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; just after the [[storming of the Bastille]], the Commune became insurrectionary in the summer of 1792, essentially refusing to take orders from the central French government.

The first mayor was [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]]; he was succeeded on November 1791 by [[Pétion de Villeneuve]] after Bailly&amp;apos;s unpopular use of the [[French National Guard|National Guard]] to disperse a riotous assembly in the [[Champ de Mars Massacre|Champ de Mars]] (17 July 1791).

In 1792, the Commune was dominated by those [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] who were not in the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] due to the [[Self-Denying_Ordinance#French_Revolution|Self-Denying Ordinance]].

On the night of 9 August 1792 a new revolutionary Commune, led by [[Georges Danton]], [[Camille Desmoulins]] and [[Jacques Hébert]] took possession of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hôtel de Ville&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; the next day insurgents assailed the [[Tuileries]], where the royal family resided. During the ensuing constitutional crisis, the collapsing Legislative Assembly of France was heavily dependent on the Commune for the effective [[power (sociology)|power]] that allowed it to continue to function as a legislature. The all-powerful Commune demanded custody of the royal family, imprisoning them in the [[Temple (Paris)|Temple]] fortress. A list of &amp;quot;opponents of the Revolution&amp;quot; was drawn up, the gates to the city were sealed, and on 28 August the citizens were subjected to domiciliary visits, ostensibly in a search for muskets. By the evening of the 31st, every prison in Paris was full to overflowing, and on 2 September the [[September massacres|massacres in the prisons]] commenced.
