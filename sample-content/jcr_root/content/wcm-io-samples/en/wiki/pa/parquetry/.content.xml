&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Parquetry&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a geometric [[mosaic]] of [[wood]] pieces used for decorative effect.

The two main uses of parquetry are as veneer patterns on furniture and block patterns for [[flooring]]. Parquet patterns are entirely geometrical and angular—[[square (geometry)|square]]s, [[triangle]]s, [[lozenge]]s.  The most popular parquet flooring pattern is [[herringbone pattern|herringbone]].  (The use of curved and natural shapes constitutes [[marquetry]] rather than parquetry.)

==History==
The word derives from the Old French &amp;apos;&amp;apos;parchet&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the diminutive of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;parc&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), literally meaning &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;a small enclosed space&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;.  Large diagonal squares known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;parquet de [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were introduced in 1684 as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;parquet de menuiserie&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;woodwork parquet&amp;quot;) to replace the marble flooring that required constant washing, which tended to rot the joists beneath the floors. Such &amp;apos;&amp;apos;parquets en lozange&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were noted by the Swedish architect [[Daniel Cronström]] at Versailles and at the [[Grand Trianon]] in 1693.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Fiske Kimball, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Creation of the Rococo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1943, p 47, noting the original accounts.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Materials==
Timber contrasting in [[color]] and grain, such as [[oak]], [[walnut]], [[cherry]], [[tilia|lime]], [[pine]], [[maple]] etc. are sometimes employed; and in the more expensive kinds the richly coloured [[mahogany]] and sometimes other tropical [[hardwood]]s are also used. While not technically a wood, [[Bamboo floor|bamboo]] is also a popular material for modern floors.

Parquet floors were formerly usually adhered with hot [[bitumen]]. Today modern cold adhesives are usually used.

==Cleaning==
Wood floors may be brushed clean, and mopped when necessary. Upright vacuum cleaners can scratch and wear the surface, as grit particles become embedded in the spinning brushes.

==Repair==
Parquet floors are usually long lasting and require little or no maintenance.

Unstuck blocks are re-glued. Bitumen-glued blocks require use of either hot bitumen or a cold bitumen emulsion, as other glue types do not adhere to bitumen.

==Domestic use==
Parquet floors are often found in bedrooms and hallways. They are considered better than regular [[Tiles#Floor_tiles|floor tiles]] since they feel warmer underfoot. However they do little to absorb sounds such as walking, vacuum cleaning and television, which can cause problems in multi-occupancy dwellings.

==Use in the NBA==
[[Image:High above courtside.jpg|thumb|right|The iconic parquet floor used by the [[Boston Celtics]] at [[TD Garden]]]]
One of the most famous parquet floors is the one used by the [[Boston Celtics]] of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. The original floor, which was installed at the Celtics&amp;apos; original home of [[Matthews Arena|Boston Arena]] in 1946, was moved intact to [[Boston Garden]] in 1952 and used there until the team moved to what was then known as FleetCenter in 1995, now known as [[TD Garden]]. The floor remained intact and in use until it was cut up and sold as souvenirs in 1999, after the 1998 demolition of Boston Garden. The Celtics today play on a parquet floor inside TD Garden that combines old and new sections.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite  web|url=http://www.tdbanknorthgarden.com/arena_history_garden.asp |title=Boston Garden History |publisher=[[TD Garden]] |accessdate=March 8, 2007}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Similar parquet-designed floors were made for the [[Orlando Magic]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves]], [[Denver Nuggets]] and [[Brooklyn Nets|New Jersey Nets]]. Of the four, only the Magic continue to use a parquet floor (which was transferred to the [[Amway Center]] from the [[Amway Arena]]); the Nets were the first of those teams to switch to a regular hardwood court (although their old parquet floor continued to be used by the [[Seton Hall Pirates men&amp;apos;s basketball|Seton Hall basketball team]] until 2007), with the Nuggets using their parquet in the latter years of the &amp;quot;rainbow&amp;quot; era (1990–93){{Clarify|date=March 2013}} and the Timberwolves installing a new floor at the [[Target Center]] for the 2008–09 season. The herringbone parquet was first used by the [[Toronto Raptors]] during their [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]] years, and was revived by the renamed Brooklyn Nets upon moving to the [[Barclays Center]] in 2012.
