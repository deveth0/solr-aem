&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peyote songs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are a form of [[Native American music]], now most often performed as part of the [[Native American Church]].  They are typically accompanied by a [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]] and [[water drum]], and are used in a ceremonial aspect during the [[sacrament]]al taking of [[peyote]].
Peyote songs began with the blend of the [[Ute people|Ute]] music style with [[Navajo people|Navajo]] singing.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.singingtotheplants.com/2009/03/peyote-songs/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Ed Tiendle Yeahquo composed over 120 peyote songs, many are still sung in NAC today. Vocal style, [[melodic contour]], and [[rhythm]] in Peyote songs is closer to Apache than Plains, featuring only two [[duration (music)|duration]]al values, predominating thirds and [[perfect fifth|fifths]] of Apache music with the tile-type melodic contour, [[incomplete repetition]]s, and [[isorhythm]]ic tendencies of Plains-Pueblo music. The [[cadence (music)|cadential]] formula use is also probably of Apache origin. (Nettl 1956, p.&amp;amp;nbsp;114)

In recent years, modernized peyote songs have been popularized by [[Verdell Primeaux]], a [[Sioux]], and [[Johnny Mike]], a [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]]. [[Jim Pepper]], who came from a [[Kaw (tribe)|Kaw]] and [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]] family, used a peyote song he learned from his grandfather as the basis for &amp;quot;Witchi Tai To&amp;quot;, which has since gone on to become a jazz and pop standard.
