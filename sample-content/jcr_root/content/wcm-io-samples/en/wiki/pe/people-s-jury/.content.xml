A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;people&amp;apos;s jury&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;citizen&amp;apos;s jury&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is an institution used by a [[democracy|democratically]] elected body to resolve a divisive issue, in order to reach a consensus.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2000/11/cf957ad2-a2c9-4a52-8fd7-c74fccadaffb |title=People&amp;apos;s Juries in Social Inclusion Partnerships: A Pilot Project |coauthors=Robin Clarke, Ruth Rennie,Clare Delap, Vicki Coombe |date=30 November 2000 |work=The Scottish Government |publisher=Development Department Research Programme |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; An example, which occurred in [[Oxfordshire]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} in the late 1990s, was the use of a people&amp;apos;s jury to resolve where to site a [[waste management|waste recycling plant]]. A group of twelve people was selected as though they were going to belong to a legal [[jury]]. They were then taken on a guided tour of the county and introduced to experts in various fields. After they had been given the opportunity to perform sufficient research, they were asked to choose the site to use.

Whilst the idea of people&amp;apos;s juries has been hailed as being of great benefit in a democracy, it has also been pointed out that the jury&amp;apos;s vote is not likely to be representative of the views of the population in general.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://sru.soc.surrey.ac.uk/SRU37.html |title=Citizens Juries: a radical alternative for social research |author=Tom Wakeford |year=2002 |work=Social Research Update 37 |publisher=Department of Sociology, University of Surrey |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is argued that because a people&amp;apos;s jury is making an informed judgement, it is unlike a [[referendum]], where the views of the most uninformed or ill-informed people carry equal weight.
