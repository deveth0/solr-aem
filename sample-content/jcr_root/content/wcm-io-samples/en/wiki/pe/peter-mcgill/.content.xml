&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peter McGill&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (August 1789 &amp;amp;ndash; September 28, 1860) was a [[Scots-Quebecer]] businessman who served as the second mayor of [[Montreal]], [[Canada East]] from 1840 to 1842.

== Biography ==

He was born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peter McCutcheon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the village of [[Creebridge]], [[Wigtownshire]] (now [[Dumfries and Galloway]]) in [[Scotland]].  In 1821, he changed his name when he became the heir of his uncle John McGill, at the latter&amp;apos;s request.

McGill held a seat in the [[Legislative Council of Lower Canada]] from 1832 to 1837, the [[Special Council of Lower Canada]] from 1838 to 1841, and the [[Legislative Council of the Province of Canada|Legislative Council of the United Provinces]] from 1841 to 1860.

McGill served as president of the [[Bank of Montreal]] from 1834 to 1860. He founded the first railway company in Canada in 1834.  It is he, rather than [[James McGill]], who is depicted in the stained-glass mural in the [[McGill (Montreal Metro)|McGill station]] of the [[Montreal metro]], even though the station is named for its proximity to [[McGill University]].

McGill Street in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vieux-Montréal&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Old Montreal) sector is named after him. It is not to be confused with McGill College Ave. near McGill University.

On his passing in 1860, Peter McGill was interred in Montreal&amp;apos;s [[Mount Royal Cemetery]].
