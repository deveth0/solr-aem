The ancient &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Perusia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, now [[Perugia]], first appears in history as one of the 12 confederate cities of [[Etruria]]. It is first mentioned in the account of the war of 310 or 309 BC between the [[Etruscans]] and the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. It took, however, an important part in the rebellion of [[295 BC|295]] and was reduced, with Vulsinii and Arretium ([[Arezzo]]), to seek for peace in the following year.

It seems the city was in the Antonii&amp;apos;s clientela since this period, as it was said by historians during imperial times.{{Or|date=August 2009}}

In [[216 BC|216]] and [[205 BC|205]] it assisted Rome in the [[Second Punic War|Hannibalic war]], but afterward it is not mentioned until 41-40 BC, when [[Lucius Antonius]] took refuge there and was reduced by [[Augustus|Octavian]] after a long siege.
Some of the refugees ran away toward Gauls to escape Octavian. A local history said they were the founders of Perouges en [[DauphinÃ©]] Province (France).

A number of lead bullets used by slingers have been found in and around the city (CIL xi. 1212). The city was burnt, we are told, with the exception of the temples of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] and [[Hera|Juno]] &amp;amp;mdash; the massive Etruscan terrace-walls, naturally, can hardly have suffered at all &amp;amp;mdash; and the town, with the territory for a mile round, was allowed to be occupied by whoever chose. It must have been rebuilt almost at once, for several bases exist, inscribed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Augusta sacr(um) Perusia restituta&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; but, as we have seen, it did not become a colony until AD 251-253.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
