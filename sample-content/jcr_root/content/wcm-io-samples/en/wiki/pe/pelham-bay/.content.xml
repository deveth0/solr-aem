: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;This article is about the body of water in the Bronx.  For other uses, see [[Pelham Bay (disambiguation)]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pelham Bay&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small [[bay]], between [[City Island (New York)|City Island]] and [[Orchard Beach, New York|Orchard Beach]] in [[the Bronx]], [[New York]].

Technically, it is a [[sound (geography)|sound]], not a [[Headlands and bays|bay]], since it is open to larger bodies of water at both ends.  It connects to [[Eastchester Bay]] at the south, and opens onto [[Long Island Sound]] and [[City Island Harbor]] at the east.

Pelham Bay was originally larger than it is today.  Approximately one third of the original bay was filled in to create [[Orchard Beach, New York|Orchard Beach]] in the 1930s.
