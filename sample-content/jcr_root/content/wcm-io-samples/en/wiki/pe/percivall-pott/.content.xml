[[Knight|Sir]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Percivall Pott&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (6 January 1714 – 22 December 1788) born in London, England was an English [[surgery|surgeon]], one of the founders of [[orthopedy]], and the first scientist to demonstrate that a cancer may be caused by an environmental [[carcinogen]].

==Life==
He served his apprenticeship with Edward Nourse, assistant surgeon to [[St Bartholomew&amp;apos;s Hospital]], and in 1736 was admitted to the [[Barbers&amp;apos; Company]] and licensed to practise. He became assistant surgeon to St Bartholomew&amp;apos;s in 1744 and full surgeon from 1749 till 1787.

As the first surgeon of his day in England, excelling even his pupil, [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]], on the practical side, Pott introduced various important innovations in procedure, doing much to abolish the extensive use of [[eschar]]otics and the [[cautery]] that was prevalent when he began his career. He also thought that soot was a carcinogen.

In 1756, Pott sustained a broken leg after a fall from his horse.  It is often assumed that his injury was the same one that later came to be known as [[Pott&amp;apos;s fracture]], but in reality Pott&amp;apos;s broken leg was a much more serious compound fracture of the [[femur]]. As he lay in the mud and muck, he sent a servant to buy a door from a nearby construction site, then had himself placed on the door and taken home. Surgeons cleaned the wound and discussed amputation, an operation which at the time had a very high rate of failure (as it often led to sepsis and death), but Pott prevailed on them to splint the leg and he ultimately recovered completely.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Gordon 1994, pp. 126–127&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  In 1768, Pott published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Some Few Remarks upon Fractures and Dislocations&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The book was translated into French and Italian and had a far-reaching influence in Britain and France.  His name was written in the annals of medicine, by first describing arthritic [[tuberculosis]] of the [[vertebral column|spine]] ([[Pott&amp;apos;s disease]]).  He gave an excellent clinical description in his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Remarks on that Kind of Palsy of the Lower Limbs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  Among his other writings the most noteworthy are &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Treatise on Ruptures&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1756), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chirurgical Observations&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 1775, Pott found an association between exposure to [[soot]] and a high incidence of [[Chimney Sweeps&amp;apos; carcinoma|scrotal cancer]] (later found to be [[squamous cell carcinoma]]) in [[chimney sweep]]s. This was the first [[occupational disease|occupational]] link to cancer, and Pott was the first person to demonstrate that a malignancy could be caused by an environmental [[carcinogen]]. Pott&amp;apos;s early investigations contributed to the science of [[epidemiology]] and the [[Chimney Sweeper&amp;apos;s Act of 1788]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Gordon 1994, p. 128&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1765 he was elected Master of the Company of Surgeons, the forerunner of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]].
