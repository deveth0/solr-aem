*The name of a mountain peak (Num. 23:28) to which [[Balak]] led [[Balaam]] as a last effort to induce him to pronounce a curse upon [[Israelites|Israel]]. The [[tribes of Israel]] are described as being visible from the peak, but nevertheless, Balaam refused to curse them, and continued to offer blessings (24:1-9).  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is similar to the Egyptian &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pi-Hor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;House of Horus&amp;quot;).
*A reference to a divinity who was worshipped at that mountain peak, and, biblically, was the subject of the [[heresy of Peor]]. The divinity, worshipped by the [[Moabites]], is biblically referred to as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baal-peor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Num. 25:3,5, 18; comp. Deut. 3:29), literally meaning &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the [[Baal]] of Peor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (The Lord of the House of Horus). An ancient [[Aramaic]] inscription, found at Dier Alla, identifies Balaam as a prophet of [[Shamash]], a [[semitic]] sun-god, and consequently, it could well be the case that the unidentified Baal of Peor is Shamash.  If Peor&amp;apos;s connection to Pi-Hor is factual, then the Baal of Peor may be the Egyptian god [[Horus]].

In John Milton&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Paradise Lost,&amp;quot; Peor is said to be the other name of the fallen angel Chemos, who &amp;quot;entic&amp;apos;d/Israel in Sittim on thir march from Nile/To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.&amp;quot; (Paradise Lost, I.412-14) His deeds are described in the first book of the epic, as Milton describes Satan&amp;apos;s followers who were banished from Heaven, and have pledged themselves as followers of the underworld.
