&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peter Neville&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (died August 9, 2002) was a further education lecturer and [[sociology|sociologist]] known for his activity in and writings about the anarchist and [[peace movement]]s in the United Kingdom.

Neville spent forty years of his life participating in these movements, and during those years he wrote articles on various topics. His work has appeared in a number of publications, including the anarchist newspaper &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Freedom (newspaper)|Freedom]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Total Liberty]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  (the &amp;quot;journal of evolutionary anarchism&amp;quot;),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchistvoices.wetpaint.com/page/Total+Liberty+Magazine |title=Total Liberty Magazine |publisher=Anarchist Voices |date= |accessdate=May 27. 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Raven (journal)|The Raven]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, an anarchist journal in which he wrote on the subject of power. Throughout the 1990s, Neville organised the [[London Anarchist Forum]].

The writings of [[Herbert Read]], especially the essays &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Existentialism&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marxism and Anarchism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, inspired him to become an anarchist.

He died on August 9, 2002 at age 69. Obituaries for him appear in issue 18 of volume 63 of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Freedom&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and issue 3 of volume 3 of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Total Liberty&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in which Neville&amp;apos;s last article was published.
