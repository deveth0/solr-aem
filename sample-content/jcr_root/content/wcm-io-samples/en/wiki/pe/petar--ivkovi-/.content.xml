&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Petar Živković&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic script]]: Петар Живковић; 1 January 1879 &amp;amp;ndash; 3 February 1947) was a [[Serbia]]n soldier and political figure in [[Yugoslavia]]. He was [[Prime Minister]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] from January 7, 1929 until April 4, 1932.

==Life==

Petar Živković was born in [[Negotin]], [[Principality of Serbia]] (present-day [[Bor District]], [[Serbia]]) in 1879. A soldier at the Serbian court, he helped to [[May Overthrow|overthrow]] the [[House of Obrenović]], with the assassination of [[Aleksandar Obrenović|King Aleksandar Obrenović]]. He later became a member of the [[Bela Ruka|White Hand]], which opposed the Serbian nationalism of the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]]. In 1921, [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] appointed Živković commander of the Palace Guards; in 1929 he was appointed prime minister.

Živković held the office as a member of the [[Yugoslav Radical Peasants&amp;apos; Democracy]], or JRSD, which was soon the only legal party in Yugoslavia, due to his electoral &amp;quot;reforms.&amp;quot; He resigned as prime minister in 1932, and shortly thereafter founded the [[Yugoslav National Party]], becoming its president in 1936.

Meanwhile, Alexander I had been assassinated, in 1934; his cousin [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Pavle Karađorđević]] took office as regent for the 11-year-old [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Petar II]]. Upon Pavle&amp;apos;s 1941 signing of the [[Tripartite Pact]], Živković left Yugoslavia, ahead of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] invasion (see [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]]). He became part of the Yugoslav government in exile.

In 1946 he was tried in absentia in Yugoslavia and sentenced to death. He remained in exile in France, dying in [[Paris]] in 1947, aged 68.
