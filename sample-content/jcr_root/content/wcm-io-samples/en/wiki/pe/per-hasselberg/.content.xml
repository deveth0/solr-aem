[[Image:Svöklockan 2010.jpg|thumb|left|upright|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Snöklockan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; at [[Mariatorget]], [[Stockholm]].]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Per Hasselberg&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (January 1, 1850 &amp;amp;ndash; July 25, 1894) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[sculpture|sculptor]]. He was also known as Petter Hasselberg or Petter Åkesson.  Little known outside Sweden, his delicate marble [[Nudity|nudes]] have received critical acclaim.  Hasselberg grew up in [[Blekinge]], but moved to [[Paris]] as a young man, where he studied under [[François Jouffroy]].  His first notable work was a sculpture titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Snöklockan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
It represents a young girl rising/standing nude (the name is from the plant [[Leucojum|snowdrop]] which is rising every spring)
Other famous work are the sculpture &amp;quot;Grodan&amp;quot; (a nude young girl playing with a frog).
