A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pegasus crossing&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (UK;  also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;equestrian crossing&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a type of signalised [[pedestrian crossing]] with special consideration for [[horse]] riders.  This type of crossing is nicknamed after the mythical winged horse, [[Pegasus]]. They are primarily used in the [[United Kingdom]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book

At a minimum, these crossings are in the form of a [[pelican crossing]] but simply have two control panels, one at the normal height for pedestrians or dismounted riders, and one two metres above the ground for the use of mounted riders, and the &amp;quot;green man&amp;quot; (walk) and &amp;quot;red man&amp;quot; (stop) [[pictogram]]s are replaced with horses.

Additional features, to improve safety, include a wooden fence or other barrier and a wider crossing so that the horses are farther away from cars than normal.  If the crossing is to be used by pedestrians and cyclists too, then a parallel, separate [[toucan crossing]] may be placed next to the Pegasus crossing.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite journal

==A66 installation and removal==
After the upgrading of the [[A66 road|A66]] between [[Greta Bridge]] and [[Scotch Corner]] was completed in 2007,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|author=The [[Highways Agency]] |url= http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/10993.htm|accessdate=2009-11-02|title=A66 Plans}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  two Pegasus crossings were installed on the section of dual carriage-way immediately to the west of Scotch Corner. These crossings included raised buttons for horse riders, safety fences and lights to control the traffic which consisted of only two orange lights. These crossings never became operational and with the exception of the safety fences were later{{when|date=March 2012}} removed.
