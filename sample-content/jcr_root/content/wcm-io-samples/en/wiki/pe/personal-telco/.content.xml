        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Personal Telco Project&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or PTP) is a [[wireless community network]] project in [[Portland, Oregon]]. It was founded by [[Adam Shand (manager)|Adam Shand]] in November 2000 after he read a [[Slashdot]] article about the [[Consume The Net]] project in [[London]].

PTP currently has about 100&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://map.personaltelco.net/ Personal Telco Node Map]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; wireless [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]]s offering free [[Internet]] access at locations around Portland including [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]], three public parks, and several restaurants and coffee shops.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ballard, Nigel, [http://www.blueoregon.com/2005/04/wifi_for_everyo.html Wi-Fi for Everyone!], BlueOregon, April 7, 2005&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  PTP is currently involved in a grant-funded project to bring free wireless Internet to an entire neighborhood in North Portland, along N. Mississippi Avenue.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Willamette Week]], [http://www.wweek.com/story.php?story=6177 Mississippi Wi-Fi&amp;apos;ing], April 6, 2005&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

PTP is a [[non-profit organization]] in the state of [[Oregon]], and received its 501(c)(3) status (a federal tax exemption granted to charitable organizations) in early 2003.

PTP made US news in August 2002 when their hotspot at [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]] was blocked by a for-fee hotspot at a nearby [[Starbucks]] coffee shop. The problem was resolved amicably when the for-fee hotspot moved their connection to another channel.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Slashdot]], [http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/08/20/0431202&amp;amp;mode=nested&amp;amp;tid=98 Starbucks Clashes With WiFi Hobbyists Over Airwaves], August 20, 2002&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On March 4, 2003, a study was published stating Portland had more wireless hotspots per capita than any other U.S. city. This was due in part to PTP&amp;apos;s advocacy.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Dundas, Zach, [http://www.wweek.com/story.php?story=5186 Free For All], Willamette Week, June 9, 2004&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
