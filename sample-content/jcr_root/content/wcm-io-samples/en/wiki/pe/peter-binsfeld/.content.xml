Peter, a son of a farmer and craftsman, was born in the village of [[Binsfeld]] in the rural [[Eifel]] region, located in the modern state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]; he died in [[Trier]] as a victim of the [[bubonic plague]]. Binsfeld grew up in the predominantly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] environment of the [[Eifel]] region.

==Education and career==
Considered by a local abbot as a very gifted boy, Peter Binsfeld was sent to [[Rome]] for study.

After his studies, Binsfeld returned to his home region and became an important personality in the anti-Protestant Catholic activities of the late 16th century. He was elected [[Auxiliary bishop]] of [[Trier]] and became a well-known theologian writer, who achieved notoriety as a one of the most prominent [[witch-hunt]]ers of his time. Binsfeld wrote the influential treatise &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De confessionibus maleficorum et sagarum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Of the Confessions of Warlocks and Witches),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Qr6_q-chR6MC&amp;amp;lpg=PR30&amp;amp;dq=peter%20binsfeld&amp;amp;pg=PR30#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=peter%20binsfeld&amp;amp;f=false Witch hunts in Europe and America: an encyclopedia By William E. Burns], p. xxx, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; translated into several languages (Trier, 1589). This work discussed the confessions of alleged [[witch]]es, and claimed that even if such confessions were produced by [[torture]], they should still be believed. He also encouraged denouncements.

He thought that girls under age twelve and boys under age fourteen could not be considered guilty of practising [[witchcraft]], but due to the precocity of some children the law should not be completely strict. This point of view can be considered as moderate, taking into account that other inquisitors had condemned children between two and five years of age to be burnt at the stake.

Contrary to other authors of the time, Binsfeld doubted that people could change shape into animals and of the validity of the [[diabolical mark]].

In 1589 Binsfield published the authoritative list of demons and their associated sins, including the demons associated with the [[Seven Deadly Sins]]: [[Lucifer]] (pride), [[Mammon]] (greed), [[Asmodai|Asmodeus]] (lust), [[Leviathan]] (envy), [[Beelzebub]] (gluttony), [[Satan]] (wrath) and [[Belphegor]] (sloth).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Encyclopedia of Demons and Demonology, By Rosemary Guiley, p. 28-29, Facts on File, 2009.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Qr6_q-chR6MC&amp;amp;lpg=PR30&amp;amp;dq=peter%20binsfeld&amp;amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=peter%20binsfeld&amp;amp;f=false Witch hunts in Europe and America: an encyclopedia By William E.
