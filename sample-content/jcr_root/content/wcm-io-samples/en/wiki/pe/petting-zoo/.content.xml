A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;petting zoo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (often called, or part of, a &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;children&amp;apos;s zoo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;) features a combination of domestic animals and some wild species that are docile enough to touch and feed. In addition to independent petting zoos, also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;children&amp;apos;s farms&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;petting farms&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, many general [[zoo]]s contain a petting zoo.  Some petting zoos can be found in city [[park]]s, and some petting zoos are also mobile and will travel to a home for a children&amp;apos;s party or event.  Many areas have a qualified mobile petting zoo.

Most petting zoos are designed to provide only relatively placid, [[herbivorous]] [[domesticated animals]] such as [[sheep]], [[goats]], [[rabbits]], [[ponies]] etc. to safely feed and physically interact with. This is in contrast to the usual zoo experience, where normally [[wild animals]] are viewed from behind safe enclosures where no contact is possible. A few provide wild species (such as [[pythons]] or baby [[big cats]]) to interact with, but these are rare and usually found outside of Western nations.

Touching animals can result in the transmission of diseases between animals and humans ([[zoonoses]]) so it is recommended that people should thoroughly wash their hands before and after touching the animals&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://eprints.ulster.ac.uk/3804/ Zoonoses associated with petting farms and open zoos]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.bovinevetonline.com/news/industry/Beware-the-fair-and-petting-zoos-170049516.html Beware The Fair (And Petting Zoos)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; There have been several outbreaks of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[E. Coli]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; etc.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.about-ecoli.com/ecoli_outbreaks/news/tests-suggest-e-coli-spread-through-air/#.UGXIQWt5lP4 Tests suggest E. coli spread through air]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
In 1938, the [[London Zoo]] included the first &amp;apos;&amp;apos;children&amp;apos;s zoo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Europe]] and the [[Philadelphia Zoo]] was the first in [[North America]] to open a special [[zoo]] just for children.

==Animals and food==

Petting zoos feature a variety of domestic animals. Common animals include [[sheep]], [[guinea pig]]s, [[goat]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[miniature horse]]s, [[camel]]s, [[llama]]s, [[pig]]s, miniature [[donkey]]s, and other [[domestic animal]]s and also wallabies.

Petting zoos are extremely popular with small children, who will often feed the animals.  In order to ensure the animals&amp;apos; health, the food is supplied by the zoo, either from [[vending machine]]s or a kiosk nearby. Food often fed to animals includes grass and crackers, and also in selected feeding areas [[hay]] is a common food. Such feeding is an exception to the usual rule about [[Do not feed the animals|not feeding animals]].
