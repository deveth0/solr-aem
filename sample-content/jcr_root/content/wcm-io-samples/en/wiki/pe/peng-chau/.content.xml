&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peng Chau&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|t=坪洲}}, [[Jyutping]]: ping4 zau1) is a small [[island]] located off the north-eastern coast of [[Lantau Island]], [[Hong Kong]], which has an area of 0.99 km².

Peng Chau is known for its small island lifestyle, accessibility to fresh seafood, and several temples located around the island (including a [[Matsu (goddess)|Tin Hau]] temple built in 1792). The tallest point of the island is Finger Hill, which is 95m in height and provides hiking opportunities for those who seek them.

As of April 2003, the island is undergoing land degradation restorative work.
