In [[philately]], a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;pen cancel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Cancellation (mail)|cancellation]] of a [[postage stamp|postage]] or [[revenue stamp]] by the use of a pen, marker or crayon.

== Usage ==
In the early days of stamps, cancellation with a pen was common. Today stamps are almost always cancelled with an inked [[Postmark|handstamp]] or a machine cancel as this is quicker to apply. Pen cancels are still sometimes seen today when a postal official needs to cancel stamps missed by the automatic cancelling machine.

There are no fixed terms for the different types of pen cancels, but a cancel in the form of two crossed lines has been referred to as an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;X cancel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://alphabetilately.com/X.html X is for X-cancel] alphabetilately.com&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Pen cancels may also take the form of notations by the canceller,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postmarks.org/covers/akron.htm |title=Covers from the Postmark Collectors Club Website |publisher=Postmarks.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; the city in which the item was posted or the initials of the local [[postmaster]].

A pen cancel may indicate fiscal (revenue) use; however, in the early days of stamps a pen cancel was sometimes used because no handstamp was available, for instance in Nicaragua where pen cancels were used for seven years after their first stamps appeared in 1862.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Sutton, R.J. &amp;amp; K.W. Anthony. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Stamp Collector&amp;apos;s Encyclopaedia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Stanley Paul, London, 1966, p.226.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Values ==
A used stamp with a pen cancel is usually worth much less than a stamp cancelled using a handstamp or machine.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psestamp.com/eyeappeal.chtml |title=Grading Guide - Eye Appeal  |publisher=Professional Stamp Experts |date= |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In particular, the additional information from the handstamp is lost and the pen cancel may indicate [[revenue|fiscal]] (revenue) rather than postal use. Pen cancelling is a common method of cancelling stamps used fiscally. Stamps marked valid for both &amp;apos;&amp;apos;postage and revenue&amp;apos;&amp;apos; use are usually worth less when fiscally used.

== Tampering ==
Some people have attempted to remove pen cancels from used stamps in order to make them appear as more valuable [[mint stamp]]s.
