The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;pericardium&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (from the Greek περι, &amp;quot;around&amp;quot; and κάρδιον, &amp;quot;heart&amp;quot; /perikardion/) is a double-walled sac containing the [[heart]] and the roots of the [[great vessels]].

==Layers==
Pericardium is a tough double layered membrane which covers the heart. The space between the two layers of it is filled with a pericardium fluid which protects the heart from any kind of external jerk or shock. There are two layers to the pericardial sac: the outermost [[fibrous pericardium]] and the inner [[serous pericardium]]. The serous pericardium, in turn, is divided into two layers, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;parietal pericardium&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which is fused to and inseparable from the fibrous pericardium, and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;visceral pericardium&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which is part of the [[epicardium]]. The epicardium is the layer immediately outside of the heart muscle proper (the [[myocardium]]).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Laizzo&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|author=Laizzo, P.A.|title=Handbook of Cardiac Anatomy, Physiology, and Devices|ISBN= 978-1603273718|edition=2|year=2009|publisher=Humana Press|pp=125-128|accessdate=2013-02-27|}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The visceral layer extends to the beginning of the great vessels, becoming one with the parietal layer of the serous pericardium. This happens at two areas: where the [[aorta]] and pulmonary trunk leave the heart and where the [[superior vena cava]], [[inferior vena cava]] and pulmonary veins enter the heart.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Laizzo&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

In between the parietal and visceral pericardial layers there is a [[potential space]] called the [[pericardial cavity]]. It is normally lubricated by a film of pericardial fluid. Too much fluid in the cavity (such as in a [[pericardial effusion]]) can result in [[pericardial tamponade]] (compression of the heart within the pericardial sac). A [[pericardiectomy]] is sometimes needed in these cases.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Laizzo&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Functions==
* Fixes heart in mediastinum and limits its motion
* Protection from infections coming from other organs (such as lungs)
* Prevents excessive dilation of heart in cases of acute volume overload
* Lubrication

==Anatomical relationships==
* Surrounds heart and bases of pulmonary artery and aorta.
* Deep to [[Human sternum|sternum]] and anterior chest wall.
* The right [[phrenic nerve]] passes to the right of the pericardium.
* The left [[phrenic nerve]] passes over the pericardium of the left ventricle.
* Pericardial arteries supply blood to the dorsal portion of the pericardium.

==Diseases and abnormalities==
* [[Pericarditis]] resulting in [[pericardial friction rub]]
* [[Pericardial effusion]] which may lead to [[cardiac tamponade]].
* [[Cardiac Tamponade]] as a primary pathology following traumatic injury.
