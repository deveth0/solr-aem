[[File:Fi-perkele.ogg|thumb|pronunciation]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Perkele&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an alternative name of [[Ukko]], the chief god of the [[Finnish paganism|Finnish pagan]] pantheon. In modern [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the interjection &amp;quot;perkele!&amp;quot; is a common profanity, approximately equivalent to &amp;quot;the Devil!&amp;quot; in meaning and &amp;quot;[[fuck]]!&amp;quot; in intensity.

==Origins==
The name is of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin. Related gods from other areas are  [[Perkūnas]] ([[Lithuania]]), [[Pērkons]] ([[Latvia]]), [[Percunis]] ([[Prussia]]), [[Piarun]] ([[Belarus]]),  [[Peko]] or Pekolasõ ([[Estonia]]) and [[Perun]] ([[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech republic]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]]).

==Use==
It has a history of being used as a curse:  a cry for the god for strength. It still is a common curse word in vernacular Finnish. To a Finn, the word entails seriousness and potency that more lightly used curses lack. Also, when the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland held a popular contest to nominate the &amp;quot;most energizing&amp;quot; word in the Finnish language, one of the suggestions was Perkele because &amp;quot;it is the curse word that gave the most strength for the reconstruction of Finland after the wars.&amp;quot; However, the popular vote was won by the word &amp;quot;Aurinko&amp;quot;, [[sun]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Pyhälahti, M.: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?7934_a=comment&amp;amp;7934_m=8067&amp;amp;s=3916 Aurinko aurinko, näytit sarves]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Research Institute for the Languages of Finland, 2010.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
For comparison, &amp;quot;Parom&amp;quot; a corrupted form of the name &amp;quot;Perun&amp;quot;, is used as a mild curse in Slovak and Czech languages - &amp;quot;Do Paroma!&amp;quot; is roughly equivalent to perkele in Finnish.

==Introduction of Christianity==
As Christianity was introduced to Finland, the church started demonizing the Finnish gods. This led to the use of &amp;quot;Perkele&amp;quot; as a translation for &amp;quot;devil&amp;quot; in the Finnish translation of the Bible, thus making the use of the word a sin. Later, in 1992 translation, the word is switched to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;paholainen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Uses in popular culture==
Many Finnish [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands like [[Impaled Nazarene]] and [[Norther]] use the word perkele for emphasis and to reference Finnishness. The Swedish [[Oi!]] band [[Perkele (band)|Perkele]] is also named after the Finnish swear word.

In [[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]] a Finnish whaler can be heard exclaiming &amp;apos;Perkele!&amp;apos; after the [[Klingon Bird of Prey]] decloaks ahead of the whaling vessel.{{Citation needed|reason=It&amp;apos;s hit and miss when you watch it. Hard to be sure.|date=June 2013}}
