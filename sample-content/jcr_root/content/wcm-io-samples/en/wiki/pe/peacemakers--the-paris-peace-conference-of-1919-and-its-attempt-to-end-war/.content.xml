&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peacemakers: The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and Its Attempt to End War&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2002) is a historical narrative based on the events of the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919]]. It was written by the [[Canada|Canadian]] historian [[Margaret MacMillan]] with a foreword by [[United States|American]] diplomat [[Richard Holbrooke]].  The book has also been published under the titles &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peacemakers: Six Months That Changed the World&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peacemakers&amp;apos;&amp;apos; describes the six months of negotiations that took place in [[Paris, France]] following [[World War I]].  The book focuses on the &amp;quot;Big Three&amp;quot;, photographed together on its cover (left to right): Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] of the [[United Kingdom]], Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] of [[France]], and President [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the [[United States]].

The book argues that the conditions imposed on [[Germany]] in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] did not lead to the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]]. [[David Lloyd George]] is the author&amp;apos;s great grandfather.
