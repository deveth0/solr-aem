        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peter of Blois&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Petrus Blesensis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (c. 1135 &amp;amp;ndash; c. 1211) was a [[France|French]] poet and diplomat who wrote in [[Latin]]. Peter studied [[law]] in Bologna and [[theology]] in Paris.  It was probably during his student years that he composed a number of Latin [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]]s after the manner of the [[Goliard]]s, some of which were preserved in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Carmina Burana]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; collection. He also wrote &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vacillantis trutine libramine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;William Doremus Paden - Medieval lyric: genres in historical context - Page 112 2000 - &amp;quot;Peter of Blois, &amp;quot;Vacillantis trutine,&amp;quot; ed. Peter Dronke, The Medieval Poet and His World (Rome: Storia e Letteratura, 1984), 298-300. la Vacillantis trutine libramine mens suspensa fluctuat et estuat, in tumultus anxios dum se vertit et bipertit ...&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Peter went with [[Stephen du Perche]] and [[Walter of the Mill]] to Sicily in 1166 and there became the tutor to King [[William II of Sicily]] in 1167. He was one of the few Frenchmen to survive the tumult of Stephen&amp;apos;s years as chancellor of Sicily. Around 1173, he went to England, where he served [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and successive [[archbishops of Canterbury]], [[Richard of Dover]], as a Latin secretary. He was appointed [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of the [[St. Peter&amp;apos;s Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton|College of Wolverhampton]], which he found corrupt. Resigning around 1202, he launched an ultimately unsuccessful bid to replace the institution with a [[Cistercian]] abbey.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=37876 Victoria County History: Staffordshire: Volume 3, n.44.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Around 1182 he was appointed [[Archdeacon of Bath]], a position he held for 26 years, followed by appointment as [[Archdeacon of London]] (1202â€“1212).

He served as Latin secretary to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], Henry&amp;apos;s widow.  Many of his letters still survive. He is incorrectly associated with [[Pseudo-Ingulf]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Croyland Chronicle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. According to historian R.W. Southern, Peter&amp;apos;s letters were widely read until the seventeenth century, &amp;quot;for pleasure and instruction by cultivated readers&amp;quot;. They conveyed &amp;quot;moral, legal and theological instruction, and...satire on men and institutions&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Southern,R.W. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Making of the Middle Ages&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1953) ISBN 0-300-00230-0 pp. 213-214&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; His brother was [[William of Blois (poet)|William of Blois]], another poet, who is sometimes confused with [[William de Blois (bishop of Lincoln)|William de Blois]], the [[Bishop of Lincoln]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |author=Sharpe, Richard |authorlink= Richard Sharpe (historian) |title=Handlist of the Latin Writers of Great Britain and Ireland Before 1540 |publisher=Brepols |location=Belgium |series=Publications of the Journal of Medieval Latin |volume=1 |edition=2001 revised |year=2001 |isbn=2-503-50575-9|page=754}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
