The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pentagon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Пентагон) [[home computer]] was a clone of the British-made [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]] [[ZX Spectrum|ZX Spectrum 128]]. It was  manufactured by amateurs in the former [[Soviet Union]]. Its PCB was copied all over the USSR, which made it the most widespread Soviet ZX Spectrum clone {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. Many simple devices (upgrades) were invented to connect to the Pentagon with a soldering iron.

The last Pentagon model was the Pentagon 1024SL v2.3, which included most of the upgrades of the standard Spectrum architecture, including 1024&amp;amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] [[random access memory|RAM]], [[Beta 128 Disk Interface]] and [[ZX-BUS]] slots (especially for [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] and [[General Sound]] cards). This model also featured a &amp;quot;turbo&amp;quot; mode (7 MHz instead of the original&amp;apos;s 3.50&amp;amp;nbsp;MHz).
