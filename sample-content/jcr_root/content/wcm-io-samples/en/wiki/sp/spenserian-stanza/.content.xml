        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Spenserian stanza&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a fixed verse form invented by [[Edmund Spenser]] for his [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Faerie Queene]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  Each stanza contains nine lines in total: eight lines in [[iambic pentameter]] followed by a single &amp;apos;[[alexandrine]]&amp;apos; line in iambic [[hexameter]]. The [[rhyme scheme]] of these lines is &amp;quot;ababbcbcc.&amp;quot;

==Example Stanza==
This example is the first stanza from Spenser&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Faerie Queene|Faerie Queene]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The formatting, wherein all lines but the first and last are indented, is the same as in contemporary printed editions.
:Lo I the man, whose Muse whilome did maske,
:&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;As time her taught, in lowly Shepheards weeds,
:&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;Am now enforst a far unfitter taske,
:&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;For trumpets sterne to chaunge mine Oaten reeds,
:&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;And sing of Knights and Ladies gentle deeds;
:&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;Whose prayses having slept in silence long,
:&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;Me, all too meane, the sacred Muse areeds
:&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;To blazon broad emongst her learned throng:
:Fierce warres and faithfull loues shall moralize my song.

==Possible Influences==
Spenser&amp;apos;s invention may have been influenced by the Italian form [[ottava rima]], which consists of eight lines of iambic pentameter with the rhyme scheme &amp;quot;abababcc.&amp;quot;  This form was used by Spenser&amp;apos;s Italian role models [[Ludovico Ariosto]] and [[Torquato Tasso]].

Another possible influence is [[rhyme royal]], a traditional medieval form used by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and others, which has seven lines of iambic pentameter that rhyme &amp;quot;ababbcc.&amp;quot;  More likely, however, is the eight-line ballad stanza with the rhyme scheme &amp;quot;ababbcbc,&amp;quot; which Chaucer used in his Monk&amp;apos;s Tale.  Spenser would have been familiar with this rhyme scheme and simply added a line to the stanza, forming &amp;quot;ababbcbcc.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Spenser Handbook&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, by H.S.V. Jones. Published by Appleton-Century-Crofts, INC&amp;gt;, New York 1958. Page 142.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Use by Others==

Spenser&amp;apos;s verse form fell into disuse in the period immediately following his death.  However, it was revived in the 1800s by several notable poets, including:
* [[Lord Byron]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Childe Harold&amp;apos;s Pilgrimage]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
* [[Felicia Hemans]] in &amp;quot;[[The Forest Sanctuary]]&amp;quot;
* [[John Keats]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Eve of St. Agnes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
* [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Revolt of Islam]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Adonais]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
* [[Sir Walter Scott]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Vision of Don Roderick]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
* [[Robert Burns]] in &amp;quot;The Cotter&amp;apos;s Saturday Night,&amp;quot; which shows his ability to use English forms while praising Scotland.
* [[William Wordsworth]] in &amp;quot;The Female Vagrant&amp;quot;, included in Wordsworth and Coleridge&amp;apos;s [[Lyrical Ballads]]
* [[Alfred Tennyson]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Lotos-eaters and Choric Song]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in the first part of the poem.
