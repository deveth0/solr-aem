&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Spherocytosis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an auto-[[hemolysis|hemolytic]] [[anemia]] (a [[blood diseases|disease of the blood]]) characterized by the production of [[red blood cell]]s (RBCs), or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;erythrocytes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, that are sphere-shaped, rather than bi-concave disk shaped.  Spherocytes are found in [[hereditary spherocytosis]] and [[autoimmune hemolytic anemia]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;HillmanAult2005&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert S. Hillman|author2=Kenneth A. Ault|author3=Henry M. Rinder|title=Hematology in clinical practice: a guide to diagnosis and management|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NJs1VpA8SEoC&amp;amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=15 November 2010|year=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-144035-6|pages=146–}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

It almost always refers to [[hereditary spherocytosis]]. This is caused by a molecular defect in one or more of the [[proteins]] of the red blood cell [[cytoskeleton]], including,  [[spectrin]], [[ankyrin]], Band 3, or Protein 4.2.  Because the cell skeleton has a defect, the blood cell contracts to its most surface-tension efficient and least flexible configuration, a sphere.  The sphere-shaped red blood cells are known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;spherocytes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Though the spherocytes have a smaller surface area through which [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] can be exchanged, they in themselves perform adequately to maintain healthy oxygen supplies.  However, they have a high [[osmosis|osmotic]] fragility--when placed into water, they are more likely to burst than normal red blood cells. These cells are more prone to physical degradation.

They are most commonly found in immunologically-mediated [[hemolytic anemia]]s and in [[hereditary spherocytosis]], but the former would have a positive [[Coombs test#Direct Coombs test|direct Coombs test]] and the latter would not.  The misshapen but otherwise healthy red blood cells are mistaken by the [[spleen]] for old or damaged red blood cells and it thus constantly breaks them down, causing a cycle whereby the body destroys its own blood supply (auto-[[hemolysis]]).

The term &amp;quot;non hereditary spherocytosis&amp;quot; is occasionally used, albeit rarely. &amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;pmid16502600&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal |author=Thoma J, Kutter D, Casel S, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;et al.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; |title=HbSC hemoglobinopathy suspected by chest x-ray and red blood cell morphology |journal=Acta Clin Belg |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=377–82 |year=2005 |pmid=16502600 |doi= |url=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
