The spiracle ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|p|ɪ|r|ə|k|əl}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|p|aɪər|ə|k|əl}}&amp;lt;ref &amp;gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spiracle Entry &amp;quot;spiracle&amp;quot;] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref &amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[OED]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 2nd edition, 1989 as {{IPA|/&amp;apos;spaɪərək(ə)l/}}.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; is a small hole behind each eye that opens to the mouth in some [[fish]]. In the primitive [[Agnatha|jawless fish]] the first gill opening immediately behind the mouth is essentially similar to the other gill opening. With the [[evolution]] of the [[jaw]] in the early [[gnathostomes|jawed vertebrates]], this gill slit was &amp;quot;caught&amp;quot; between the forward gill-rod (now functioning as the jaw) and the next rod, the [[Hyomandibula|hyomandibular bone]], supporting the jaw hinge and anchoring the jaw to the [[skull]] proper. The gill opening was closed off from below, the remaining opening was small and hole-like, and is termed a &amp;quot;spiracle&amp;quot;. The spiracle is still found in all [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]] except [[requiem shark]]s, [[hammerhead shark]]s, and [[chimaera]]s, and in some primitive [[Osteichthyes|bony fishes]], the ([[coelacanth]], [[sturgeon]], [[Acipenseriformes|paddlefish]] and [[bichir]]s). It is also seen as an [[otic notch]] in the skull of the extinct [[Labyrinthodontia| labyrinthodonts]], and is thought to be associated with the [[ear]] opening in [[amniote]]s and [[frog]]s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Alfred Romer|Romer, A.S.]] (1949): &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Vertebrate Body.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia. (2nd ed. 1955; 3rd ed. 1962; 4th ed. 1970)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Insect]]s and some more derived [[spider]]s have spiracles on their [[exoskeleton]]s to allow air to enter the [[Invertebrate trachea|trachea]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Solomon, Eldra, Linda Berg, Diana Martin (2002): Biology. Brooks/Cole.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In the [[respiratory system of insects]], the tracheal tubes primarily deliver [[oxygen]] directly into the animals&amp;apos; [[Biological tissue|tissue]]s. The spiracles can be opened and closed in an efficient manner to reduce water loss. This is done by contracting closer muscles surrounding the spiracle. In order to open, the muscle relaxes. The closer muscle is controlled by the [[central nervous system]] but can also react to localized chemical stimuli. Several aquatic insects have similar or alternative closing methods to prevent water from entering the trachea.  Spiracles may also be surrounded by hairs to minimize bulk air movement around the opening, and thus minimize water loss.
