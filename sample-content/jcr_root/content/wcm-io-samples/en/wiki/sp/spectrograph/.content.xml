A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;spectrograph&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  is an instrument that separates an incoming wave into a [[frequency spectrum]]. There are several kinds of machines referred to as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;spectrographs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, depending on the precise nature of the waves. The term was first used in 1884.

==Stellar &amp;amp; solar spectrograph==
The first spectrographs used [[photographic paper]] as the detector. The star [[stellar classification|spectral classification]] and discovery of the [[main sequence]], [[Hubble&amp;apos;s law]] and the [[Galaxy morphological classification|Hubble sequence]] were all made with spectrographs that used photographic paper. The plant pigment [[phytochrome]] was discovered using a spectrograph that used living plants as the detector. More recent spectrographs use electronic detectors, such as [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]s which can be used for both visible and [[ultraviolet|UV]] light. The exact choice of detector depends on the wavelengths of light to be recorded.

The forthcoming [[James Webb Space Telescope]] will contain both a near-infrared spectrograph (NIRSpec) and a mid-infrared spectrometer (MIRI).

==Echelle spectrograph==
{{main|Echelle spectrograph}}
An [[echelle spectrograph]] uses two [[diffraction grating]]s, rotated 90 degrees with respect to each other and placed close to one another. Therefore an entrance point and not a slit is used and a 2d CCD-chip records the spectrum. Usually one would guess to retrieve a spectrum on the diagonal, but when both gratings have a wide spacing and one is [[Blazed grating|blazed]] so that only the first order is visible and the other is blazed that a lot of higher orders are visible, one gets a very fine spectrum nicely folded onto a small common CCD-chip. The small chip also means that the collimating optics need not to be optimized for coma or astigmatism, but the [[spherical aberration]] can be set to zero.
