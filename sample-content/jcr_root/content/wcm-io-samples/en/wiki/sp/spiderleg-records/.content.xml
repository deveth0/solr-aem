        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Spiderleg Records&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[independent record label]] founded by [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[anarcho-punk]] band [[Flux Of Pink Indians]] in [[1981 in music|1981]].

The band set up the label after releasing their first EP on the [[Crass Records]] label, which both taught them the skills necessary to run such a project and provided them with the seed cash. In turn, the band not only used the label to release their own material, but gave opportunities to like-minded [[Punk rock|punk]] bands to put out records, including [[Subhumans (UK band)|The Subhumans]], who in a similar fashion set up the Bluurg label. Others that released records on Spiderleg included [[The System (UK band)|The System]], [[Amebix]] and [[Antisect]].

The first record to be put out was a re-recording of older material made when the band were known as The Epileptics (they changed the name to EPI-X following complaints from the [[British Epilepsy Association]] and eventually emerged as Flux Of Pink Indians having reverted to The Epileptics and then The Licks). This was an EP entitled &amp;quot;1970s Have Been Made In Hong Kong&amp;quot; which had originally been released by the small [[Bishop&amp;apos;s Stortford]] based label [[Stortbeat Records|Stortbeat]]. However the band fell into dispute with Stortbeat when the label allegedly re-released the single without paying the band owed [[copyright|royalties]]. The re-recording is also notable for featuring [[Penny Rimbaud]] of [[Crass]] on [[Drum kit|drums]] as the original Epileptics drummer was not available.

The label had considerable indie chart success, with several hits on the [[UK Indie Chart]], including a number one album with Flux of Pink Indians&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Strive To Survive Causing The Least Suffering Possible]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which also reached number 79 on the [[UK Album Chart]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Strong&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Strong, Martin C. (1999) &amp;quot;The Great Alternative &amp;amp; Indie Discography&amp;quot;, Canongate, ISBN 0-86241-913-1&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Derek Birkett]], [[bass guitar|bass]] player of Flux Of Pink Indians, later set up the highly successful [[One Little Indian Records]], whose releases have included material by [[BjÃ¶rk]], [[The Shamen]], [[Skunk Anansie]], [[Queen Adreena]] and [[Chumbawamba]] amongst others.
