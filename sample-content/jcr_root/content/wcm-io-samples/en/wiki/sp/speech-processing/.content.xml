        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Speech processing&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the study of [[Speech communication|speech]] [[Signal (information theory)|signals]] and the processing methods of these signals. The signals are usually processed in a [[Digital data|digital]] representation, so speech processing can be regarded as a special case of [[digital signal processing]], applied to speech signal.{{Clarify|date=December 2010}} Aspects of speech processing includes the acquisition, manipulation, storage, transfer and output of digital speech signals.

It is also closely tied to [[natural language processing]] (NLP), as its input can come from / output can go to NLP applications. E.g. [[text-to-speech]] synthesis may use a [[syntactic parsing|syntactic parser]] on its input text and [[speech recognition]]&amp;apos;s output may be used by e.g. [[information extraction]] techniques. The main applications of speech processing are the recognition, synthesis and compression of human speech.

Speech processing includes the following areas of study:
* [[Speech recognition]] (also called voice recognition), which deals with analysis of the [[linguistics|linguistic]] content of a speech signal and its conversion into a computer-readable format.
* [[Speaker recognition]], where the aim is to recognize the [[Identity (social science)|identity]] of the speaker.
* [[Speech coding]], a specialized form of [[data compression]], is important in the [[telecommunication]] area.
* [[Voice analysis]] for medical purposes, such as analysis of [[vocal loading]] and dysfunction of the [[vocal cords]].
* [[Speech synthesis]]: the artificial synthesis of speech, which usually means computer-generated speech. Advances in this area improve the computer&amp;apos;s usability for the visually impaired.
* [[Speech enhancement]]: enhancing the [[intelligibility]] and/or perceptual quality of a speech signal, like [[audio noise reduction]] for audio signals.
* [[Speech data compression|Speech compression]] is important in the telecommunications area for increasing the amount of information which can be transferred, stored, or heard, for a given set of time and space constraints.
* [[Speaker diarization]] is the process of determining who spoke when in a signal.
