The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Spearfish torpedo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (formally Naval Staff Target 7525) is the heavy [[torpedo]] used by the [[submarine]]s of the [[Royal Navy]]. It can be guided by [[wire guidance|wire]] or by [[acoustic homing|autonomous active or passive sonar]], and provides both [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) and [[Anti-surface warfare|anti-surface ship warfare]] (ASuW) capability.

It replaces the unreliable [[Tigerfish torpedo]], which was withdrawn in 2004; the significantly higher speed of the Spearfish, for which development started  in the 1970s, before the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]], was intended to catch high-speed, deep-diving [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]] threats such as the {{sclass2|Alfa|submarine}}.

==Design==
The torpedo is driven by a [[pump-jet]] coupled to a [[Hamilton Sundstrand]] 21TP04 [[gas turbine engine]] using [[Otto fuel II]] and hydroxyl ammonium perchlorate as oxidiser.

A [[microprocessor]] enables the torpedo to make autonomous tactical decisions during the attack. It has a powerful blast warhead, triggered by either contact detonation (against a submarine hull) or an acoustic [[proximity fuze]] (for under-keel detonation against ships).

==Production==
The production contract for the Spearfish Torpedo was placed with [[Marconi Company|GEC-Marconi]] Underwater Systems Ltd (now [[BAE Systems]]) in 1983, following a development programme lasting for several years.

==Deployment==
Spearfish entered full production in 1988, with deliveries completed in 2003; the number ordered has not been revealed. Spearfish torpedoes are stored and serviced at [[Beith]] Ordnance Storage facility in [[North Ayrshire]].
