==Life==
He was born in Skinner&amp;apos;s Row, [[Dublin]], the son of a [[silversmith]], to whose business he was brought up. He took over the business but was not successful.&amp;lt;ref name=sp&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Boylan|first= Henry |year=1998|title=A Dictionary of Irish Biography, 3rd Edition|pages=14|location=Dublin|publisher= Gill and MacMillan|isbn= 0-7171-2945-4}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

His first appearance on the stage was at the [[Theatre Royal, Dublin|Theatre Royal]], Smock Alley, Dublin, on the 5 February 1744, and his engagement at once increased its prosperity. His first [[London]] appearance was made in 1746 as [[Othello (character)|Othello]] at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]. Here his talents were speedily recognized, and in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hamlet]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Macbeth]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; he alternated with [[David Garrick]], arousing the latter&amp;apos;s jealousy by his success as [[Romeo]]. This resulted in his leaving Drury Lane for the [[Covent Garden Theatre]] in 1750, accompanied by [[Susannah Maria Arne|Mrs Cibber]], his Juliet. Both houses now at once put on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Romeo and Juliet]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for a series of rival performances, and Barry&amp;apos;s Romeo was preferred by the critics to Garrick&amp;apos;s.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;sp&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

In 1758 Barry opened the Crow Street theatre in Dublin, and later a new theatre in [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. He staged many successful productions but seems to have lived beyond his means.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;sp&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; In 1767 returned to London to play at the [[Haymarket Theatre]], then under the management of Foote. As his second wife, he married in 1768 the actress [[Ann Street Barry|Mrs Dancer]] (1734â€“1801), and he and Mrs Barry played under Garrick&amp;apos;s management, Barry appearing in 1767, after ten years absence from the London stage, in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Othello]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, his greatest part. In 1774 they both moved to Covent Garden, where Barry remained until his death.
