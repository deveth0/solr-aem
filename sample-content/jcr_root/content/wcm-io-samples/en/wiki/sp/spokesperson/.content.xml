A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;spokesperson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;spokesman&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;spokeswoman&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is someone engaged or elected to speak on behalf of others.

In the present media-sensitive world, many organizations are increasingly likely to employ  professionals who have received formal training in [[journalism]], [[Communication studies|communications]], [[public relations]] and [[Public administration|public affairs]] in this role in order to ensure that public announcements are made in the most appropriate fashion and through the most appropriate channels to maximize the impact of favorable messages, and to minimize the impact of unfavorable messages.  Popular local and national sports stars (such as [[Michael Jordan]] or [[Bob Uecker]]) are often chosen as spokesmen for commercial advertising.

The term &amp;quot;spokesperson&amp;quot; is [[gender-neutral language]] which uses a [[gender-neutral job title]]. &amp;quot;Spokesman&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;spokesperson&amp;quot; can refer to both men and women. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== Responsibilities ==
Unlike an individual giving a personal [[testimonial]], it is the job of a spokesperson to faithfully represent and advocate for the organization&amp;apos;s positions, even when these conflict with his or her own opinion.  Lots of celebrities have done some work as spokespeople.  &amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;isbn0-7914-3762-0&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |author=Goodman, Michael B. |title=Corporate communications for executives |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y |year=1998 |pages=13 |isbn=0-7914-3762-0 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  As a result, spokespersons are generally selected from experienced, long-time employees or other people who are known to support the organization&amp;apos;s goals.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;isbn0-7914-3762-0&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

== Identity ==
A corporation may be represented in public by its [[chief executive officer]], [[chairman]] or [[president]], [[chief financial officer]], [[counsel]] or external legal advisor. In addition, on a day-to-day level and for more routine announcements, the job may be delegated to the corporate communications or [[investor relations]] departments (or equivalents), who will act as spokesmen.

In the particle physics community, large collaborations of physicists elect one (or two) spokesperson(s) as leader(s) of the collaboration.  The spokesperson in such cases is the lead scientist of the collaboration, not a public speaker.  Each collaboration chooses the roles and responsibilities of the spokesperson for internal purposes, but typically spokespersons also have defined roles for liaising with the host laboratory and/or funding agencies.
