&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Virus Bulletin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a magazine about the prevention, detection and removal of [[malware]] and [[spam (electronic)|spam]]. It regularly features analyses of the latest virus threats, articles exploring new developments in the fight against viruses, interviews with anti-virus experts, and evaluations of current [[Antivirus software|anti-malware]] products.

Technical experts from all of the major anti-virus vendors have written articles for the magazine, which also conducts in-depth comparison tests of the detection rates of anti-virus software. Products which manage to detect 100% of the viruses in the wild, without false alarming, are given the VB100 award.

The magazine holds an annual conference (in late September, early October) which is the premier technical event of the anti-virus industry.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Security companies and corporations meet to discuss the latest malware threats and papers presented, in a technical and corporate capacity, regarding industry developments. Among its recent sponsors are development tools and data services company [[OPSWAT Inc.]] as well as anti-malware companies like [[ESET]], [[Kaspersky]] and CA (formerly [[Computer Associates]]).
