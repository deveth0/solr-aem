        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Violin Concerto No. 2&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in D minor, Op. 22, by the [[Poland|Polish]] [[violin]] [[virtuoso]], [[Henryk Wieniawski]], may have been started in 1856, but the first performance did not take place until November 27, 1862, when he played it in [[St. Petersburg]] with [[Anton Rubinstein]] conducting. It was published in 1879, inscribed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;to his dear friend [[Pablo de Sarasate]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The work is in three [[movement (music)|movements]]:

# Allegro moderato in D minor/F major
# &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Romance&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: Andante non troppo in B flat major
# Allegro con fuoco – Allegro moderato (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;à la Zingara&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) in D minor/D major

Both main elements of the first movement, its sombre, restless first subject, and its lyrical pendant (begun by a solo [[horn (instrument)|horn]]) are discussed freely and subject to dazzling embellishments by the solo violin.  This movement includes a demanding variety of technique, including [[Chromaticism|chromatic]] [[glissandi]], double stops, [[arpeggio]]s, sixths, octaves, thirds, chromatic scales, and [[artificial harmonic]]s, not to mention a myriad of bowing techniques. The beat is based on a 4/4 or common time. The first movement uses a half-[[sonata form]] where the orchestral coda after the exposition transitions into the second movement instead of a development section.

The slow movement, a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Romance (music)|Romance]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, follows without a break. It is based on a lilting tune in 12/8 time and rises to an impassioned central climax.

A rhapsodic passage marked &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Allegro con fuoco&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and mainly a solo [[cadenza]], leads to the finale, a dashing rondo in the [[Romani people|gypsy]] style, which quotes the first movement&amp;apos;s subsidiary theme in the course of its second and third episodes. The final movement implements a 2/4 time, which allows the violinists to emphasize certain notes in the beginning of some measures.

Wieniawski&amp;apos;s second Violin Concerto remains one of the greatest violin concertos of the Romantic era, memorable for its lush and moving melodies and harmonies.

==Instrumentation==
The concerto is scored for solo [[violin]] and an orchestra consisting of 2 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 2 [[Horn (instrument)|horns]], 2 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s (alto, tenor and bass), [[timpani]], and [[String section|strings]].
