&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vivinus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Automobile|car]]s were made by Ateliers Vivinus S.A. of [[Schaerbeek]], [[Brussels]] (1899 - 1912).

The owner, Alexis Vivinus (1860-1929), had made bicycles in the 1890s and become an importer of [[Benz &amp;amp; Cie.|Benz]]. From 1895 he started to make his own range of cars. These were belt-driven [[voiturette]] models with a 785 cc single-cylinder engine and 2-speed transmission by belt drive. Licences to make his designs were sold to firms such as [[New Orleans (automobile)|New Orleans]] of [[England]], [[Georges Richard]] of France and [[De Dietrich]] in [[Germany]].

From 1907 a range of more conventional 4-cylinder cars were made with shaft drive along with motorcycles and aero engines.

The company went into liquidation in 1912. The workshop was taken over by [[Fabrique Automobile Belge]]. Vivinus himself later joined [[Minerva (automobile)|Minerva]].
