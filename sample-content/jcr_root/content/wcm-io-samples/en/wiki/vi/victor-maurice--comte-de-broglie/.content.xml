&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Victor-Maurice, comte de Broglie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (12 March 1647 – 4 August 1727) was a [[France|French]] [[soldier]] and [[general]].

Victor-Maurice de Broglie was born in the  De Broglie house, a noble family originally from [[Piedmont]]. He was the  son of [[François-Marie, comte de Broglie]] and Angelique de Vassal, Countess of [[Favria]]. After the death of his father  he inherited  [[Revel]] Counties and de Broglie, the marquisate of [[Senonches]] and  also received the Government of La Bassee, near [[Lille]].

He served under [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé|Condé]], [[Henri de la Tour d&amp;apos;Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], and other commanders of the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in the [[Franco-Dutch War]] and other conflicts.

He was named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[maréchal de camp]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1676, [[lieutenant-general]] in 1688, and finally [[marshal of France]] in 1724, just three years before his death.

He had three sons, one of whom predeceased him.  The second son, [[Charles-Guillaume, marquis de Broglie]], was his heir, while the third son, [[François-Marie, 1st duc de Broglie|François-Marie]], a general and a marshal of France like his father, became the first [[duc de Broglie]].
