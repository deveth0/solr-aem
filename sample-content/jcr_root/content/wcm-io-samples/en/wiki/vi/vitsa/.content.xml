&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vitsa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-el|Βίτσα}}) is one of the largest villages of central [[Zagori]].  It is situated at an altitude of 955m on a mountain slope near the [[Vikos gorge]] with roads linking it to [[Greek National Road 6]].  Vitsa is famous for its old double-arched bridge of Missios.

==History==
During ancient times, [[Zagori]] was inhabited by the [[Molossians]]. Excavations in the location Genitsari near Vitsa led to the discovery of a settlement possibly of the [[Tymphaean]]s or the [[Molossian]]s dated to the 9th until the 4th century BC. There were signs of the foundations of small buildings from the [[Archaic Greece|archaic]] (geometric) and [[Classical Greece|classical period]]s and a graveyard with at least 140 graves that contained coins, pottery and weaponry.

The establishment of the village of Vitsa is referred to in other documents from 1321 to 1361, under the name of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vezitsa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Some buildings from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times are still preserved. The village is divided by a chasm in two districts that were once different villages called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ano Vitsa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kato Vitsa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Upper and Lower Vitsa).&amp;lt;ref name=Kathareios&amp;gt;A. Kathareios (Inspector of the 1st educational region of Epirus) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Report of Inspection of Zagorochoria in 1913&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; These two villages were always considered, along with [[Monodendri]], as more or less one village, due to their small distance.

After 1430, when the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] conquered [[Ioannina]], Vitsa and the rest of [[Zagori]] villages formed an autonomous federation, the Commons of the Zagorisians ({{lang-el|Κοινόν των Ζαγορισίων}}). Further privileges were granted to the Commons of the Zagorisians  due to the influence of [[Phanariot]] Zagorisians over the [[Sublime Porte|court of the Sultan]], and were preserved until 1868. According to these privileges, Zagori was autonomous and self-governed under the surveillance of the [[Vekylis]] of [[Zagori]]. Another important privilege that the Zagorians had was the freedom to practice their Christian faith. The absence of direct Ottoman rule helped the inhabitants attain a good standard of living. The main source of income in the 18th and 19th centuries was from remittances from [[expatriates]], as elsewhere in [[Zagori]].

Vitsa became a cultural center for the [[Zagori]] region and was the birthplace of people such as the Sarros family (among them politicians and engineers involved at the [[Suez Canal]] works in the 19th century) and Nikolaidis (man of literature).

Since the 17th century and until [[World War II]], (when Zagorisian traditional emigration ended), most people from Vitsa would emigrate to [[Egypt]], [[Asia Minor]] and the [[U.S.A.]]. Inside geographical [[Greece]], they mostly emigrated to [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]].&amp;lt;ref name=Kathareios/&amp;gt;

== Buildings ==
In addition to the double arched bridge of Missios (built in 1748 AD), there is the church of Agios Georgios or of the Taxiarches from 1607 AD, the church of Agios Nikolaos (1612 AD, with well preserved frescoes), the church of the [[Dormition of the Virgin]] (Κοιμήσεως της Θεοτόκου) from 1554 (repaired in 1720-1728) in Lower Vitsa, the manors of Belogiannis, Vasdekis and Skevis and the Vrizopouleios School. The church of the Stavropegiac Monastery of Prophetes Elias (1632) survives in the north of Vitsa. It was founded upon an older foundation of a small 14th-century church of the Transfiguration of Christ.

== Folklore ==
Vitsa celebrates the Feast of the Dormition of the Virgin (15 August).
