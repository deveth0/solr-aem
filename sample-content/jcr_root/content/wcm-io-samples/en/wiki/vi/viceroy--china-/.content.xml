&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zongdu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tsung-tu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; {{zh|t=總督|s=总督|w=Tsung&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-tu&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;|p=Zǒngdū}}; [[Manchu language|Manchu]]: [[Image:Uheri1.png|60px]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Uheri kadalara amban&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), usually translated as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viceroy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Governor-General&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, governed one or more [[province of China|provinces]] of [[Qing]]-dynasty [[China]]. One of the most important was the [[Viceroy of Zhili]] (Chihli), since it emcompassed the imperial capital. [[Yuan Shikai]], later president of the [[Republic of China]], held this office. It was also used by Japan during her colonization of Korea and Taiwan. The Chinese term first came into use during the [[Ming Dynasty]].

The lists of regional viceroys in [[Qing dynasty]] were:

*[[Viceroy of Zhili]]
*[[Viceroy of Liangjiang]]: Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui
*[[Viceroy of Min-Zhe]]: Fujian, Zhejiang, Taiwan
*[[Viceroy of Huguang]]: Hunan, Hubei
*[[Viceroy of Shaan-Gan]]: Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang
*[[Viceroy of Liangguang]]: Guangdong, Guangxi
*[[Viceroy of Yun-Gui]]: Yunnan, Guizhou
*[[Viceroy of Sichuan]]
*[[Viceroy of Three Northeast Provinces]]: Fengtian, Jilin, Heilongjiang

Certain provinces were not governed by any regional viceroys. These include the provinces of [[Shanxi]], [[Shangdong]] and [[Henan]].

Besides the regional viceroys, there were also special types of viceroys, such as [[Viceroy of Southern Rivers]] and [[Viceroy of Eastern Rivers]], who were in charge of waterways.
