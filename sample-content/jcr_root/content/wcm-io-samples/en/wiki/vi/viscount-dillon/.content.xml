&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscount Dillon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,  of [[Barony of Costello|Costello]]-[[Barony of Gallen|Gallen]] in the [[County Mayo|County of Mayo]], is a title in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]. It was created in 1622 for [[Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon|Theobald Dillon]], [[Lord President of Connaught]]. The Dillons were an [[Hibernia|Hiberno]]-[[Normans|Norman]] landlord family from the 13th century in a part of County [[Westmeath]] called &amp;apos;Dillon&amp;apos;s Country&amp;apos;. His great-grandson, the seventh Viscount, was a supporter of the Catholic [[James II of England|King James II of England]] and was outlawed after the [[Glorious Revolution]]. He founded &amp;apos;[[Dillon Regiment|Dillon&amp;apos;s Regiment]]&amp;apos; of the [[Irish_Brigade_%28French%29#Formation|Irish Brigade]] in the French Army, which was supported by the [[Flight of the Wild Geese|Wild Geese]] and achieved success at [[Battle of Fontenoy|Fontenoy]] in 1745.

However, his son, the eighth Viscount, managed to obtain a reversal of the outlawry in 1694 and later served as [[Lord Lieutenant of Roscommon|Lord Lieutenant of County Roscommon]]. His nephew, the tenth Viscount, was given the [[Peerage of France|French]] title of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Count Dillon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1711 and was also created &amp;quot;Earl of Dillon&amp;quot; by [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] claimant to the throne. His younger brother, the twelfth Viscount, was a Colonel in the [[French Army]], but Dillon&amp;apos;s Regiment was disbanded in 1793 due to the turmoils of the [[French Revolution]].

His son, the twelfth Viscount, notably represented [[Westbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Westbury]] in Parliament and conformed to [[Anglican]]ism in 1767. His son, the thirteenth Viscount, sat as a [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Harwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Harwich]] and [[Mayo (UK Parliament constituency)|County Mayo]]. His great-grandson, the nineteenth Viscount, was a [[Brigadier]] in the Army. {{As of|2010}} the viscountcy is held by the latter&amp;apos;s great-grandson, the twenty-second Viscount, who succeeded his father in 1982.

==In France==

Being of foreign origin, the Dillons needed to be &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;reconnus nobles en France&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;noblesse d&amp;apos;origine etrangere&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;maintenus nobles&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. They were &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;maintenus nobles&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1759.

What&amp;apos;s more, they were acknowledged as being of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;extraction chevaleresque&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (very old nobility), having been noble since 1347, and so allowed to the [[:fr:Honneurs de la Cour|&amp;quot;Honneurs de la Cour&amp;quot;]] by the King of France in 1750, 1769, 1770, 1775, 1777, 1785 and 1788.
