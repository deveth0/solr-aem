&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscount Stansgate&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Stansgate in the County of Essex, is a currently disclaimed title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created in 1942 for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician and former [[Secretary of State for India]] and [[Secretary of State for Air]], [[William Wedgwood Benn, 1st Viscount Stansgate|William Wedgwood Benn]]. He was the second son of [[Sir John Benn, 1st Baronet|Sir John Benn, 1st Baronet, of The Old Knoll]]. Lord Stansgate&amp;apos;s eldest son and heir apparent, the Hon. Michael Benn, was killed in the [[Second World War]], and he was consequently succeeded by his younger son, the second Viscount, better known as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician [[Tony Benn]]. He disclaimed the peerage in 1963 on the day the [[Peerage Act 1963]] passed into law and made it possible for him to do so. On Tony Benn&amp;apos;s death the title will be passed on to the next in line, his elder son Stephen Benn. Both Tony Benn and his sons are in [[Remainder (law)|remainder]] to the [[Benn baronets|Benn Baronetcy of The Old Knoll]], which if it becomes [[vested interest|vested]] on that cadet branch of the family, would, as with its present holder, entitle its most senior male to the use of the formal style &amp;quot;Sir&amp;quot;.
