&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Victoire Léodile Béra&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1824–1900) was a French [[novelist]], [[journalist]] and [[feminist]]. She took the name of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;André Léo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, her two twin sons&amp;apos; names.

She was born in [[Lusignan]], [[Vienne]], at  Town Hall square, in 1824. She stayed there until 1830, when her father moved to Champagné Saint Hilaire, where he was a judge. She left the region in 1851, with her future husband, Gregoire Champseix, who fled from [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]]&amp;apos;s police.

She fought with the [[French Republic]]ans, later during the [[Commune de Paris]], and in the [[International Workers Association]]. Travelling in [[Europe]], she studied and worked at improving the feminine condition of her times. She died in [[Paris]] in 1900, after achieving much work: numerous novels, tales and essays, articles and political texts. Her writings, especially on social and educational issues, express ideas which still remain highly topical.
