        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Via Severiana&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an ancient [[Roman road]] in central [[Italy]] leading from [[Latium et Campania (Roman Regio)|Latium to Campania]] (and now in [[Lazio]]), running southeast from [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]] to [[Terracina]], a distance of 80 Roman miles (c. 118&amp;amp;nbsp;km) along the coast. It took its name from the restoration of already existing roads, carried out during the reign of emperor  [[Septimius Severus]] (198 AD).

It ran along the shore at first, just behind the line of villas which fronted upon the sea, and are now some 1&amp;amp;nbsp;km inland, or even upon its edge (for an inscription records its being damaged by the waves). Farther southeast it seems to have kept rather more distant from the shore, and it probably kept within the lagoons below the [[Cape Circeo|Circean promontory]].  Cities connected by the Via Severiana included [[Portus]] (the starting point), Ostia, [[Laurentum]], [[Lavinium]], [[Anzio]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Antium&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), Astura (modern Torre Astura) and Terracina.

Remains of the via Severiana are scanty. There are the remains of at least one [[Roman bridge]] along the road, which crosses the [[Numicus]] two km southeast of Ostia.
