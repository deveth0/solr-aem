&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;View Road Hospital&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is located at Admiralty Road West, [[Woodlands, Singapore]]. It used to be a medical complex in Singapore specialising in the treatment of patients with mental illnesses. The hospital used to be a subsidiary of Woodbridge Hospital (now known as the Institute of Mental Health) and was closed down in 2001. The premises was converted into a foreign workers dormitory known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;View Road Lodge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=MSL NE Trail|url=http://mslnetrails.blogspot.sg/2009/07/view-road-hospital.html|accessdate=15 September 2012|newspaper=MSL NE TRAIL|date=July 19, 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
Previously known as “Batu Rimau Gurkha”, the building was allotted by the British Bases Conversion Unit to the [[Ministry of Health (Singapore)|Ministry of Health]] around the late 1960s to early 1970s. In 1969, as Woodbridge Hospital reached a peak of 2,654 average daily occupancy and there was a need to relieve overcrowding at the hospital and the location of the serene surroundings of the building made it ideal for the Ministry of Health to set up a secondary institution there.

In June 1972, the building was handed over to Woodbridge Hospital. Concrete plans were then put in place in July 1973 to convert it into a secondary mental hospital. The hospital was officially completed on 27 May 1975 and commissioned on 1 August 1975. The first batch of patients were admitted to the hospital on 4th August 1975. In 1990, the hospital began to take in female patients and the next year saw the hospital undergoing major renovations. By 1994, there were close to 294 patients housed at the hospital.

In 2001, the hospital ceased to operate and its premises was converted into a foreign worker dormitory.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Marsiling Heritage Trial|url=http://heritagetrail.mslportal.edu.sg/MSL_POIHistory.aspx|accessdate=15 September 2012|newspaper=Marsiling Heritage Trial|date=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
