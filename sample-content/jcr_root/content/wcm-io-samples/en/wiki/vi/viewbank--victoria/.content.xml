&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viewbank&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a suburb of [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], 14&amp;amp;nbsp;km north-east of Melbourne&amp;apos;s [[Melbourne City Centre|Central Business District]]. Its [[Local government areas of Victoria|local government area]] is the [[City of Banyule]]. At the [[Census in Australia#2011|2011 Census]], Viewbank had a population of 6,731.

The [[Yarra River]] and large tracts of the Yarra Valley Parkland run along one border of the suburb. The [[Plenty River (Victoria)|Plenty River]] forms Viewbank&amp;apos;s eastern boundary, whilst its northern boundary is defined by Lower Plenty Road (a main road linking [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]] and [[Eltham, Victoria|Eltham]]). Viewbank&amp;apos;s public schools are [[Viewbank Primary School]] and [[Viewbank College]] (formerly Rosanna East High School, merging with Banyule High School in 1994). Viewbank&amp;apos;s many parks include Banyule Flats (which includes one of inner Melbourne&amp;apos;s largest intact wetlands), Viewbank Reserve, Price Park and Castleton Park.

Although mainly a residential area, there is a small commercial strip on Martins Lane adjacent to Viewbank Primary School.

==History==

Viewbank was named after a farming property (since demolished) built at the junction of the Yarra and Plenty Rivers during the 1840s. Remnants of Viewbank&amp;apos;s farming past can be seen from the historic silos still standing on Banyule Road.

The area was primarily developed around the 1960s. Viewbank Post Office opened on 1 October 1962 and was renamed Banyule in 1969.&amp;lt;ref name = &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Citation| last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&amp;amp;country= | accessdate = 11 April 2008 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Several new housing developments were built during the 1990s and 2000s, including the end of Martins Lane, Winston Hills and Eagle View (on Casey Crescent).

==Notable residents==

In the 1980s Australian Aerial Freestyle Olympic Gold Medallist [[Alisa Camplin]], Catherine Fitzsimmons (Pearsell model and founder of Dash Models, [[Los Angeles]]), Australian Olympic Runner [[Tamsyn Manou]] all attended Viewbank Primary School.
