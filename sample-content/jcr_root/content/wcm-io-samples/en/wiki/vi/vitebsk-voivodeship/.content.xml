&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vitebsk Voivodeship&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-be|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Віцебскае ваяводзтва&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}, {{lang-pl|Województwo witebskie}}, {{lang-la|Palatinatus Vitebsciensis}}) was a unit of administrative division and local government in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] (from 1569 [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]) from the 15th century until the [[partitions of Poland]] in 1795.

[[Zygmunt Gloger]] in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland provides this description of the Witebsk Voivodeship:

“Witebsk (in Latin Vitebscum), located on the [[Dvina]] river, was one of main [[Gord (archaeology)|gord]] of the [[Principality of Polotsk]]. In the second half of the 12th century, it emerged as a local center of government. Conquered by one of the sons of [[Mindaugas]] in ca. 1239, it became a permanent part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] since the times of [[Gediminas]]. In ca. 1342 Witebsk was already the seat of a [[starosta]]s, who in the early 16th century were named [[voivode]]s. First voivode of Witebsk was Jerzy Chlebowicz (...)

The [[Dvina]] river divided the voivodeship into two parts, of which northern one was smaller. Since the town of Witebsk was located in the middle of a sparsely populated province, at first  the voivodeship was not divided into counties. Later on, however, the County of [[Orsha|Orsza]], which had been part of [[Smolensk Voivodeship]], was attached to Witebsk Voivodeship (...) Witebsk Voivodeship  remained in the Commonwealth until September 1772, when most of it was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]]. What remained was southern part of the Land of Orsza, which belonged to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until 1793 (...)

[[Starosta]]s resided at Witebsk and Orsza, while local [[sejmik]]s took place in both towns. Altogether, Witebsk Voivodeship elected four deputies to the [[Sejm]] - two from each county. After the first partition, the sejmiks were moved to the town of Cholopienicze, located in [[Minsk Voivodeship]]”.

Voivodeship Governor ([[Wojewoda]]) seat:
* [[Vitebsk]]

Voivodes: [[Samuel Sanguszko]] (1629- XI 1638), [[Paweł Jan Sapieha]] (15 VIII 1646-)

Administrative division:
* since the [[Truce of Andrusovo]] (1667), Vitebsk Voivodeship consisted of two counties ([[powiat]]s): Witebsk and Orsza. The first was lost to the [[Russian Empire]] in 1772, and only a little part of the second belonged to the Commonwealth until 1793.
