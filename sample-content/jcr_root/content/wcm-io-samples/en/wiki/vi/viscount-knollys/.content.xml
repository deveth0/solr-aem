It was created in 1911 for the court official [[Francis Knollys, 1st Viscount Knollys|Francis Knollys, 1st Baron Knollys]], [[Private Secretary to the Sovereign]] from 1901 to 1913. He had been previously created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Knollys&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Caversham in the County of Oxford, in 1902.
