The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Virginia dynasty&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a term sometimes used to describe the fact that four of the first five [[President of the United States|Presidents of the United States]] were from [[Virginia]].  The term sometimes excludes [[George Washington]], who, though a Virginia planter, was closely aligned with the policies of the [[Federalist Party]], and was succeeded by his [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[John Adams]] of [[Massachusetts]].  The first five presidents were, in order, George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe.

The defeat of Adams in 1800 by his Vice President, [[Thomas Jefferson]], who had previously served as Washington&amp;apos;s [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], marked the true beginning of the Virginia Dynasty, which is usually associated with what is now called the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], although it was generally referred to as simply the &amp;quot;Republican&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Jeffersonian&amp;quot; Party at the time.  Jefferson served two terms before retiring, in the Washingtonian precedent, in favor of his Secretary of State, fellow Virginian [[James Madison]], the so-called &amp;quot;Father of the Constitution.&amp;quot;  Although the [[War of 1812]] greatly weakened Madison&amp;apos;s popularity in the Northeast, especially in [[New England]] which consequently discussed [[Hartford Convention|secession]], he was nonetheless re-elected rather easily in 1812 and was able to assist another Virginian who had remained loyal to him and the party, [[James Monroe]], to be elected President in 1816.

By the end of Monroe&amp;apos;s first term the Federalist Party had essentially disbanded and Monroe was re-elected in 1820 without any real opposition, receiving every [[U.S. Electoral College|electoral vote]] except one, which went for Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]], son of John Adams. (Much later a myth arose that the dissenting elector had done so in order that George Washington would be the only president in American history to be elected unanimously.)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Electoral Vote against Monroe in 1820-An American Legend |first=Lynn W. |last=Turner |work=[[The Mississippi Valley Historical Review]] |volume=42 |number=2 |month=September |year=1955 |pages=250â€“273 |publisher=[[Organization of American Historians]] |jstor=1897643}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Monroe&amp;apos;s second term marked the end of the Virginia Dynasty.  In the [[United States presidential election, 1824|election of 1824]], supporters of [[William H. Crawford]] portrayed him as &amp;quot;the rightful and legitimate successor of the Virginia Dynasty,&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Lenner, Andrew C. (2001), [http://books.google.com/books?id=PQ8NJ4CSy6IC&amp;amp;pg=PA151&amp;amp;cad=0_0&amp;amp;sig=0HfVWhmuSFCKnKu8HPnfnyfS7SQ#PPA152,M1 &amp;quot;The Federal Principle in American Politics, 1790-1833.&amp;quot;] Rowman &amp;amp; Littlefield, p.152.  ISBN 0-7425-2071-4.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; but the Democratic-Republican Party splintered.  John Quincy Adams won the disputed 1824 election over General [[Andrew Jackson]] of [[Tennessee]], then considered to be part of the Southwest.

After having contributed four of the first five Presidents and their having held office for thirty-two of the first thirty-six years of the constitution, to date four more Virginians have served as President.  They are [[William Henry Harrison]], Virginia-born but elected as a resident of [[Ohio]]; [[John Tyler]], who was elected Vice President in 1840 as Harrison&amp;apos;s running mate, but wound up serving all but the first month of the latter&amp;apos;s term after Harrison became the first President to die in office; [[Zachary Taylor]], who made his name as a [[Kentucky]] resident; and [[Woodrow Wilson]], who was a Virginia native but was elected President after serving as the president of [[Princeton University]] and [[Governor of New Jersey]].
