&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Victoria Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small public [[park]] near to the centre of [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], [[Berkshire]], [[England]]. Current features of the park include a [[bandstand]], [[tennis courts]], [[Lake|boating lake]], [[bowls]] club, [[skatepark]], and a [[statue]] of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].

==History==

[[Image:Victoria Park - Newbury.jpg|thumb|Victoria Park boating lake]]
Originally Victoria Park was called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Marsh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, however by the turn of the 20th century the name Victoria Park had arisen. This is likely due to the Queen&amp;apos;s popularity and the fact that many public celebrations, such as the Queen&amp;apos;s [[Diamond Jubilee|jubilee]] were held in the park. The statue of her was originally placed in the Market Place in 1903, subsequently moved to Greenham House in 1933 and then to Victoria Park 1966.

Up until the 1930s the park was [[common land]], which included the right to graze [[cattle]]. The park used to be larger, however it has been gradually encroached upon by housing and the nearby [[A339]] road to the eastern edge of the park, which up until the building of the [[A34 road (England)|Newbury bypass]] was the main route for traffic between [[Oxford]] and [[Southampton]].

The A339 was in fact built on the path of a [[stream]] called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Minny Flush&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, because of the number of [[Leuciscinae|minnow]]s to be found in it.

===The American Bridge===
[[Image:Parkway bridge - Newbury.jpg|thumb|The new bridge over the Kennet and Avon canal.]]
During the [[World War II|Second World War]] a temporary or emergency [[bridge]] was built over the [[Kennet and Avon canal]], joining the park with the centre of town. The reason for this was because it was feared the other main bridge in the centre of town was to be [[bomb]]ed which would have effectively split the town in two. Although it was supposed to be a temporary bridge it became a key crossing point and lasted up until 2001 when it was replaced with a new structure. Erroneously this was called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;American Bridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos; because although it was built by civilian contractors for the [[War Office]] its plans had been stamped by the [[United States Army|American Army]], certifying its use for their forces. A major problem with the temporary bridge was that it was only 7&amp;amp;nbsp;ft high, much lower than the recommended height of 8&amp;amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;amp;nbsp;in.
