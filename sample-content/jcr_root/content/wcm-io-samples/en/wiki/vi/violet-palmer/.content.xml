&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Violet Renice Palmer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born July 20, 1964) is an American [[basketball]] referee in the [[NBA]] and [[WNBA]] and the first female official to reach the highest competitive tier in a major U.S. professional sport. She also earned recognition as a member of two [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] women&amp;apos;s championship basketball teams. Palmer was the first woman to officiate an NBA playoff game when she did so in the April 25, 2006 match between the [[Indiana Pacers]] and [[New Jersey Nets]]. In the NBA, Palmer wears uniform number 12.

==Biography==
A native of [[Compton, California]], Palmer grew up in the same neighborhood where [[Serena Williams|Serena]] and [[Venus Williams]] lived as small children. She attended college at [[Cal Poly Pomona]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | title=Cal Poly Pomona | url=http://www.csumentor.edu/campustour/undergraduate/1/Cal_Poly_Pomona/Cal_Poly_Pomona5.html| work= CSU Mentor | accessdate=2008-09-12}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; where she played [[point guard]] on the 1985 and 1986 NCAA Division II women&amp;apos;s championship teams.

In 2001, Palmer established Violet Palmer&amp;apos;s Official Camp to train youths in the art of refereeing. The camp runs annually from July 9 to July 11.

In 2010, Palmer was part of a family team on the game show &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Family Feud]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Referee career==
Palmer has officiated hundreds of NBA games, as well as others in the [[WNBA]].

After years of refereeing at various levels, including NBA pre-season and exhibition games, Palmer was offered an opportunity to officiate the NCAA Division I men&amp;apos;s tournament in 1996. She accepted, but the offer was later retracted when NCAA members balked at the idea of having a female referee male players.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In 1997, however, Palmer and [[Dee Kantner]] were signed by the NBA to together become the first top-level female referees in any major U.S. professional sport. On October 31, 1997, Palmer made history when she officiated the NBA season opener between the [[Memphis Grizzlies|Vancouver Grizzlies]] and the [[Dallas Mavericks]], in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199710310VAN.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

As a [[woman]], Palmer&amp;apos;s achievement was received with mixed feelings. While magazines such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ebony magazine|Ebony]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sports Illustrated]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} generally celebrated her achievement, some NBA players were critical.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  Charles Barkley: &amp;quot;Violet, I was wrong about you. I apologize. You&amp;apos;re all right with me.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | title=Violet Palmer Biography | url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2005-La-Pr/Palmer-Violet.html| work= Notable Biographies}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Former basketball player [[Dennis Scott (basketball)|Dennis Scott]], who played for the [[Phoenix Suns]] at the time, also expressed concern at having females referee male players.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Scott, in particular, worried that female referees would feel verbally or physically abused. However, Palmer has been officiating without any major gender issues so far.

She was one of three NBA referees who officiated the [[Knicksâ€“Nuggets brawl|brawl]]-marred December 16, 2006, game between the [[Denver Nuggets]] and [[New York Knicks]]. The officiating crew, which also consisted of [[Dick Bavetta]] and [[Robbie Robinson (referee)|Robbie Robinson]], ejected all 10 players who were on the court when the brawl broke out.

On May 28, 2009, Palmer was hired as coordinator of women&amp;apos;s basketball officials for the [[West Coast Conference]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.ncaa.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/052809aaa.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
