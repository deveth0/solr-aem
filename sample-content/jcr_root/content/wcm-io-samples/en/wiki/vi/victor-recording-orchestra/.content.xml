The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Victor Recording Orchestra&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[jazz]] band led by [[Jean Goldkette]]. Founded in 1924, it was considered by [[Rex Stewart]] to be the best dance band of its day and the &amp;quot;first original white [[Swing (genre)|swing]] band.&amp;quot; It was known for its innovative arrangements and strong rhythm.

Among its members were:

* [[Bix Beiderbecke]]
* [[Steve Brown (bassist)|Steve Brown]]
* [[Hoagy Carmichael]]
* [[Jimmy Dorsey]]
* [[Tommy Dorsey]]
* [[Eddie Lang]]
* [[Pee Wee Russell]]
* [[Frankie Trumbauer]]
* [[Joe Venuti]]
* [[Bill Rank]]

Among the band&amp;apos;s own arrangers was [[Russ Morgan]]; the band also traded arrnagements with [[Fletcher Henderson]]. The band&amp;apos;s most popular records included &amp;quot;After I Say I&amp;apos;m Sorry,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;[[Dinah]],&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Gimme a Little Kiss, Will Ya, Huh?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Lonesome and Sorry.&amp;quot; According to [[Rex Stewart]], the primitive recording techniques of the day (for example, bass and snare drums could not be recorded) failed to provide a true record of the band.
