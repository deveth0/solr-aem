&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscount Clermont&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Clermont in the County of Louth, was a title in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]. It was created in 1776 for [[William Fortescue, 1st Earl of Clermont|William Fortescue, 1st Baron Clermont]], with remainder in default of male issue of his own to his brother [[James Fortescue]] and the heirs male of his body. He was the son of [[Thomas Fortescue (1683–1769)|Thomas Fortescue]]. Fortescue had already been made &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Clermont&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Clermont in the County of Louth, in the Peerage of Ireland in 1770, with normal remainder to heirs male, and was made &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Clermont&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Clermont in the County of Louth, in the Peerage of Ireland at the same time as he was granted the viscountcy, also with remainder to his brother James Fortescue. In 1777 he was further honoured when he was made &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earl of Clermont&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in the County of Louth, in the Peerage of Ireland, with normal remainder to heirs male. Lord Clermont died without male issue in 1806 when the barony of 1770 and earldom became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony of 1776 and viscountcy according to the special remainder by his nephew William Fortescue, the second Viscount, the son of the aforementioned James Fortescue. The second Viscount Clermont represented [[Louth (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|County Louth]] in both the Irish and British Parliaments and was an [[Irish Representative Peer]]. He died unmarried in 1829 when the barony and viscountcy became extinct.

The Clermont title was revived in 1852 when [[Thomas Fortescue, 1st Baron Clermont|Thomas Fortescue]] was made [[Baron Clermont]]. He was a descendant of Chichester Fortescue, brother of William Fortescue, grandfather of the first Earl of Clermont.
