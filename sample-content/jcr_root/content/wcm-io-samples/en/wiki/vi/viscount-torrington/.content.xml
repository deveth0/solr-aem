&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscount Torrington&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a title in the [[Peerage of Great Britain]]. It was created in 1721 for the statesman [[George Byng, 1st Viscount Torrington|Sir George Byng, 1st Baronet]], along with the subsidiary title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Byng&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Southill in the County of Bedford, also in the Peerage of Great Britain. He had already been created a [[baronet]], of Wrotham in the County of Kent, in the [[Baronetage of Great Britain]] in 1715. His eldest son, the second Viscount, represented [[Plymouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth]] and [[Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Bedfordshire]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and later served as [[Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard]] from 1746 to 1747. His younger brother, the third Viscount, was a [[Major-General]] in the Army. His grandson, the sixth Viscount, was a [[Vice-Admiral]] in the [[Royal Navy]]. His son, the seventh Viscount, served as [[Governor of Ceylon]] between 1847 and 1850.

On his death the titles passed to his nephew, the eighth Viscount, the son of Honourable Robert Barlow Palmer Byng, third son of the sixth Viscount. He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Viscount. However, this line of the family failed on his death in 1944 and the titles passed to the late Viscount&amp;apos;s first cousin, the tenth Viscount. As of 2009 the titles are held by the latter&amp;apos;s grandson, the eleventh Viscount, who succeeded on his grandfather&amp;apos;s death in 1961.

Several other members of the Byng family have also gained distinction. The Hon. [[Robert Byng]], third son of the first Viscount, was [[Member of Parliament]] for Plymouth. He was the father of [[George Byng (d. 1789)|George Byng]], radical Member of Parliament for [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]]. He was the father of [[George Byng (1764–1847)|George Byng]], [[Father of the House|Father of the House of Commons]], and [[John Byng, 1st Earl of Strafford]]. The soldier [[Julian Hedworth George Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy]], was the youngest son of the second Earl of Strafford. Admiral the Hon. [[John Byng]], who was controversially court-martialled and shot in 1757, was the fourth son of the first Viscount Torrington.

The family seat is Great Hunts Place, near [[Winchester]], [[Hampshire]].
