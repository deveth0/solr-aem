&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vilho Petter Nenonen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (March 6, 1883, [[Kuopio]] - February 17, 1960) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[general]].

He received his military education in the Hamina Cadet School 1896-1901, in the Mihailov Artillery School in St Petersburg 1901-1903, and in St Petersburg Artillery Academy 1906-1909. He served in the [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] [[army]] during [[World War I]]. When the [[Finnish Civil War]] began he moved to Finland and was given the job of creating the [[artillery]] of [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|general Mannerheim]]&amp;apos;s [[White Guard (Finland)|White Army]]. After the war Nenonen also served as the [[Minister of Defence (Finland)|Minister of Defence]] between 1923 and 1924. During the [[Continuation War]] he was a part of Mannerheim&amp;apos;s inner circle. He was promoted to the rank of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;General of the artillery&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1941.

Nenonen developed the [[Finnish Army]]&amp;apos;s [[artillery]] and tactics that proved decisive in the defensive victory in the [[Battle of Tali-Ihantala]].  The trajectory calculation formulas he developed are still in use today by all modern artillery.
