[[File:Nci-vol-2727-300 Vincent DeVita.jpg|thumb|Dr. Vincent T. DeVita, Jr. ([[Mike Mitchell (photographer)|Mike Mitchell]],1999)]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vincent Theodore DeVita, Jr.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, MD  (born March 7, 1935) is an internationally recognized pioneer [[physician]] in the field of [[oncology]]. He was born in [[The Bronx]], New York.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=_a87AAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;q=%22Devita,+Vincent+Theodore%22+1935&amp;amp;dq=%22Devita,+Vincent+Theodore%22+1935&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=M92WUfeuApCxigKKh4C4CQ&amp;amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

DeVita earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from the [[College of William and Mary]] in 1957. He was awarded his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree with distinction from the [[George Washington University]] School of Medicine in 1961.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;award&amp;quot;&amp;gt;(12 June 2007) [http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=39098 Vincent T. DeVita, Jr., MD Honored by ASCO], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Webwire&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (press release), Retrieved October 28, 2010&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

DeVita spent the early part of his career at the National Cancer Institute ([[NCI]]). In 1980, the president of the United States appointed him as director of the NCI and the National Cancer Program,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;cancer1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Greenberg, Daniel S. [http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM198010233031744 A Conversation with Vincent T. DeVita, Jr., M.D.], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,  1980; 303:1014-1016, Retrieved October 28, 2010&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; a position he held until 1988. While at the NCI, he was instrumental in developing combination chemotherapy programs that ultimately led to an effective regimen of curative chemotherapy for [[Hodgkin&amp;apos;s disease]] and diffuse large cell [[lymphoma]]s. Along with colleagues at the NCI, he developed the four-drug combination, known by the [[acronym]] [[MOPP (medicine)|MOPP]], which increased the cure rate for patients with advanced Hodgkin&amp;apos;s disease from nearly zero to over 70%.

In addition, in collaboration with Dr. [[George Canellos]], DeVita developed the combination chemotherapy [[Cyclophosphamide Methotrexate Fluorouracil|CMF]], which still remains a useful therapy for [[breast cancer]].

DeVita was the Director of [[Yale Cancer Center]] from 1993 to 2003. He is currently the chair of the Yale Cancer Center advisory board and is professor of [[internal medicine]] and of [[epidemiology]] and [[public health]] at [[Yale School of Medicine|Yale&amp;apos;s medical school]].

DeVita currently serves on the editorial boards of numerous scientific journals and is the author or co-author of more than 450 scientific articles. He is one of the three editors of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and serves as the editor-in-chief of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Cancer Journal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

== Personal ==

Vincent DeVita diagnosed his son [[Ted DeVita|Ted]] as a child with [[aplastic anemia]]. Ted thereafter was placed in a sterile environment for his safety, and died in 1980 at the age of 17. Ted&amp;apos;s [[boy in the bubble|situation]], and that of [[David Vetter]], inspired the 1976 TV movie &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Boy in the Plastic Bubble]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; starring [[John Travolta]].
