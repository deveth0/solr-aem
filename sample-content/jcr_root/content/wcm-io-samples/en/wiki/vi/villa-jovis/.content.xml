&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Villa Jovis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Villa of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]]&amp;quot;; also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Villa Iovis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, sometimes misspelled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Villa Ionis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] palace on [[Capri]], southern [[Italy]], built by emperor [[Tiberius]] and completed in [[27|AD 27]]. Tiberius mainly ruled from there until his death in [[37|AD 37]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;heid&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Villa Jovis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the largest of the twelve Tiberian villas on Capri mentioned by [[Tacitus]]. The entire complex, spanning several terraces and a difference in elevation of about 40 m, covers some 7,000&amp;amp;nbsp;m² (1.7 acres).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;heid&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zaw.uni-heidelberg.de/hps/klarch/institut/villa_jovis.htm | title=Archäologisches Institut Heidelberg - Villa Jovis | publisher=[[Heidelberg University]] | date=2003 | accessdate=July 06, 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; While the remaining eight levels of walls and staircases only hint at the grandeur the building must have had in its time, recent reconstructions have shown the villa to be a remarkable testament to 1st-century Roman architecture.

==Location and description of the palace==

[[File:Capri sights.png|thumb|left|Map of Capri with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Villa Jovis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the North-East corner of the island]]

Villa Jovis is situated in the very northeast of the island atop &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Monte Tiberio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; its 334 m elevation makes it the second-highest peak of Capri,   after &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Monte Solaro&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (589 m elevation) in [[Anacapri]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Krause (2003), p. 28&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The north wing of the building contained the living quarters, while the south wing saw administrative use.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Krause (2003), p. 82–83&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The east wing was meant for receptions, whereas the west wing featured an open-walled hall (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ambulatio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) which offered a scenic view towards Anacapri.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Krause (2003), p. 83&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

As water was difficult to come by where the villa was built, Roman engineers constructed an intricate system for the collection of rainwater from the roofs and a large [[cistern]] that supplied the palace with fresh water.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Krause (2003), p. 83&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

South of the main building there are remains of a [[watch tower]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;specula&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) for the quick [[telegraph]]ic exchange of messages with the mainland, e.g. by fire or smoke.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Krause (2003), p. 84&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Access to the complex is only possible on foot, and involves an uphill walk of about two kilometres from Capri town.

==Tiberius and his life on Capri==

Apparently the main motivations for Tiberius&amp;apos;s move from Rome to Capri were his wariness of the political manoeuvring in Rome and a lingering fear of [[assassination]]. The villa is situated at a very secluded spot on the island and  Tiberius&amp;apos;s quarters in the north and east of the palatial villa were particularly difficult to reach and heavily guarded.

The Villa Jovis is also, at least according to [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], the place where Tiberius engaged in wild debauchery.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;suetonius-twelve-caesars-43&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Suetonius, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Lives of Twelve Caesars&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#43 43], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#44 44], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#45 45]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Modern historians regard these tales as sensationalized, but Suetonius&amp;apos; stories at least paint a picture of how Tiberius was perceived by the Roman people at the time.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Wallace-Hadrill, Andrew (1984) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Suetonius: The Scholar and His Caesars&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Yale University Press, ISBN 0-300-03000-2&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
