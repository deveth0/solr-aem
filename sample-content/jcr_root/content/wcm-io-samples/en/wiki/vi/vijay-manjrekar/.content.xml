&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vijay Laxman Manjrekar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{audio|Vijay_Manjrekar.ogg|pronunciation}} (26 September 1931 in [[Mumbai]] â€“ 18 October 1983 in [[Madras]]) is a former [[Indian cricket team|Indian cricketer]] who played 55 Tests. A small man, he was a fine cutter and hooker of the ball.  He was the father of [[Sanjay Manjrekar]].

His debut came against [[England cricket team|England]] at [[Eden Gardens|Calcutta]] in 1951, making a composed 48. He scored his first Test hundred in June 1952 against England at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] making 133. It was his first Test in England and he was just 20 at the time. When he came in to bat his side was in trouble at 3/42 and faced a formidable lineup of bowlers in [[Fred Trueman|Trueman]], [[Alec Bedser|Bedser]] and [[Jim Laker|Laker]].

He put on 222 with [[Vijay Hazare|Hazare]] in an innings that showed he would be a force to be reckoned with in the future.  He would however fail to fulfill his early promise and faced problems with his weight and footwork. He would eventually finish with a Test average of 39, a disappointment for a man capable of averaging well into the 40&amp;apos;s. His finest series came against England in India 1961-62 when he made 586 runs @ 83.71. This included the highest score of his 7 centuries, with 189 at [[Feroz Shah Kotla|Delhi]]. Another notable performance was in 1964-65 where his innings of 59 and 39 helped India to a Test victory over [[Australia cricket team|Australia]]. He scored a ton in his final Test innings, coming against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] at [[M. A. Chidambaram Stadium|Madras]] in February 1965.

He holds the records for the most test [[Run (cricket)|runs]] scored (3,208) without hitting a single [[Boundary (cricket)|six]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Walmsley&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Walmsley|first=Keith|title=Mosts Without in Test Cricket|year=2003|publisher=Keith Walmsley Publishing Pty Ltd|location=Reading, England |isbn=0947540067|pages=457}}.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Manjrekar was also an occasional [[Off spin|offspinner]] and occasional [[wicketkeeper]].
He played for 6 sides in the Ranji Trophy, representing [[Mumbai cricket team|Mumbai]], [[Bengal cricket team|Bengal]], [[Uttar Pradesh cricket team|Uttar Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan cricket team|Rajasthan]], [[Andhra Pradesh cricket team|Andhra Pradesh]], and [[Maharashtra cricket team|Maharashtra]]. He had a prolific career in the tournament, scoring 3,734 runs @ 57.44.

He died aged 52 in Madras on 18 October 1983.
