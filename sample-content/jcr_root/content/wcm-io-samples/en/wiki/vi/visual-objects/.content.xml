        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Visual Objects&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[computer]] [[programming language]] that is used to create [[software program]]s that operate primarily under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. Although it can be used as a general-purpose programming tool, it is almost exclusively used to create database programs.

The original Visual Objects project (code-named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aspen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was started as part of [[Nantucket Corporation|Nantucket]]&amp;apos;s attempts to bring the [[Clipper (programming language)|Clipper]] language to Windows, and move from the [[Procedural programming|procedural]] to the [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] style. It also converted Clipper from a [[p-code machine|p-code]] system to being a true native compiler and introduced more elements of the [[C (programming language)|C language]] (such as typed [[Variable (programming)|variables]]), while including Windows extensions (such as [[Component Object Model|COM]], [[ODBC]], and later [[ActiveX Data Objects|ADO]]). With its symbol datatype, it offers the ability to form name-based linkages, which may be used to connect [[Menu (computing)|menu]] events to [[Method (computer science)|object methods]] or form direct linkages between server columns and controls.

The Windows version was finally brought to market by [[Computer Associates]].  Unfortunately it was released before it was market-ready and in almost head-to-head competition with the first release of [[Borland]]&amp;apos;s [[Delphi programming language|Delphi]] product. The language is still in use however the last release by [[GrafX Software]] was in 2007. The next incarnation of the Visual Objects language is [[Vulcan.NET programming language|Vulcan.NET]], written by GrafX from scratch to be both Visual Objects compatible and be a true CLS compliant .NET language, taking full advantage of the .NET framework.
