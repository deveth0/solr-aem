        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vincent Bourne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, familiarly known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vinny Bourne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1695, [[Westminster]] â€“ December 2, 1747) was an [[England|English]] classical scholar.

==Life==
He was the son of Andrew Bourne of [[Westminster]]. In 1710 he became a scholar at [[Westminster School]], and in 1714 entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He graduated in 1717, and obtained a fellowship three years later.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Venn|id=BN714V|name=Bourne, Vincent}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Of his later life little is known: for most of it he was an usher at Westminster school.

==Works==
During his lifetime he published three editions of his [[Latin]] poems, and in 1772 there appeared a [[quarto]] volume containing all Bourne&amp;apos;s pieces, but also some that did not belong to him.

The Latin poems are, a number of them, translations of English poems. [[William Cowper|Cowper]], an old pupil of Bourne&amp;apos;s, [[James Beattie (writer)|James Beattie]], and [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], praised of his power of Latin versification.

An edition (1840) of his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Poemata&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has a memoir by [[John Mitford (clergyman)|John Mitford]].
