        text="&lt;p&gt;[[Malcolm Bricklin]] is head of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;V Cars. LLC&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Visionary Vehicles&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; prior to mid-2008,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketwire.jiaodong.net/ReadNews.aspx?C=0000644565&amp;amp;L=EN |title=marketwire新闻首页 |publisher=Marketwire.jiaodong.net |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; that was to be the North American distributor of [[Chery]] Automobiles.  Bricklin&amp;apos;s foray with Chery ended in mid-2006 after Chery allegedly used the relationship to enter the US market, then backed out of the contract with VV.

In a documentary film (The Entrepreneur) made by his son Johnathan, Malcolm Bricklin is shown with his lawyer in litigation against Chery auto makers.

Bricklin&amp;apos;s strategy was to bring in cars and crossover SUVs that were competitive with German brands (Audi especially), but priced similarly to Honda vehicles.  The lineup was to start with a mid-size car, a sporty coupe and small crossover.  Later, with Bricklin funding, a bespoke line of front-wheel-drive vehicles was to have been developed.  Following the front wheel drive vehicles, a rear wheel drive platform was contemplated which would have pushed Visionary into the Audi/BMW/Mercedes class of vehicles.

Bricklin&amp;apos;s distribution strategy was to have dealers invest in Visionary Vehicles and in Chery, different from traditional dealer-distributor-manufacturer relationships.  The dealer investments of $2-million were to be put in an escrow account until being used to fund investments in products from Chery.

All dealer-investors and other investing parties are suing Chery auto makers in China for breach of contract and several other categories of litigation for over $1 billion.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/basicIndustries/idINN2141944520080721 |title=Entrepreneur Bricklin sues Chery over failed deal |publisher=Reuters.com |date= 2008-06-22}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Visionary intends to bring a $35,000 luxury [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]] [[V2G]]-capable [[PHEV]] to market around 2010. VV just announced it would compete for the [[X-Prize]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/842.html |title=Promising News from PHEV Startups: Fisker &amp;amp;#124; Visionary Vehicles &amp;amp;#124; Venture Vehicles |publisher=Calcars.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-27}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
