        text="&lt;p&gt;[[File:AfricaMap1.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Map showing the road between Bardia and Sidi Barrani called &amp;quot;Via della Vittoria&amp;quot;. It coincided with Graziani&amp;apos;s advance.]]

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Via della Vittoria&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a military road between [[Bardia]] in [[Italian Libya]] and [[Sidi Barrani]] in western [[Egypt]].

== Characteristics ==
The &amp;quot;Via della Vittoria&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Victory Road&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;), was a [[road]] built by [[Italy|Italian]] [[engineer]]s during [[World War II]], between June and December 1940. The road went from [[Sidi Barrani]], [[Egypt]], to the border of [[Italian Libya]] and connected to the [[Libyan Coastal Highway|Via Balbia]].

== History ==
The Italian Army invaded Egypt in summer 1940 and penetrated until Sidi Barrani. The need of communication in order to supply the Army forced the construction of this new road.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.egyptstudycircle.org.uk/Articles/p280QC223.pdf The Italian Army initial attack on Egypt]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

{{Quote|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Proceeding in an orderly, colonial fashion, the Italian commander in Egypt, General Mario Berti, deployed the advanced units of his Army (1st and 2nd Libyan, 3 January Blackshirt, Cirene and Catanzaro Divisions, as well as Malettiâ€™s motorised brigade group) in a ring of strong-points around Sidi Barrani, and began work on extending the Via Balbia into Egypt..&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Edmund Hall. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Italian attack on Egypt&amp;apos;&amp;apos; p.281&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;}}

In fall 1940 Italian Marshal [[Rodolfo Graziani]] ordered his Army in western Egypt to complete this new coastal road extending the Via Balbia 60 miles inside Egypt, even in order to create an infrastructure for a planned Italian invasion of the [[Nile Delta]] in January/February 1941.

But in December 1940 the new road was used by the [[United Kingdom|British]] forces during [[Operation Compass]]. In the next two years the road was damaged by the continuous changes in the [[front]] between [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces under [[Erwin Rommel]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].
