&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Victor G. Szebehely&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (August 21, 1921 [[Budapest]]  – September 13, 1997 [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]) was a key figure in the development and success of the [[Apollo program]].

Szebehely was born in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. He went to the [[United States]] in 1947 and became a [[naturalized citizen]] in 1956.  In 1956, a dimensionless number used in time-dependent unsteady flows was named “Szebehely’s number,” and in 1957, he was knighted by HRH [[Queen Juliana]] of the [[Netherlands]]. In the September and October 1977 issues of the journal Celestial Mechanics, volume 16, an equation used to determine the [[Potential energy|gravitational potential]] of the [[Earth]], [[planet]]s, [[satellite]]s, and [[galaxy|galaxies]] was named “[[Szebehely’s equation]]”.

He worked with [[General Electric]], [[Yale University]], the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], the [[United States Air Force]], [[NASA]], and the [[University of Texas at Austin]].  One of his areas of research was [[orbital debris]] and planetary defense against [[meteor impact]]s.

Szebehely authored &amp;quot;Hydrodynamics of Slamming Ships&amp;quot; as David Taylor Model Basin Report 823 in 1952 and co-authored &amp;quot;Ship Slamming in Head Seas&amp;quot; as DTMB Report 913 in
1955.
He was the author of several books.

His first book, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Theory of Orbits&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is an important work in [[orbital mechanics]], being the definitive text on the [[restricted three-body problem]] as applicable to an Earth-[[Moon]] [[spacecraft]] system such as [[Apollo program|Apollo]]. In 1978 he received the very first  [[Brouwer Award|Dirk Brouwer Award]] from the Dynamical Astronomy Division of the [[American Astronomical Society]].

He died in [[Austin, Texas]] at age 76.
