== Biography ==
Although he is Sevillian by birth, he was raised and lives in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], where he attended his first guitar lessons with [[El Tomate]] and [[Merengue de Córdoba]], and later, he improved his guitar playing with [[Manolo Sanlúcar]], with whom he worked for ten years. After a period of accompaniment which began alongside El Pele, he started to devote himself almost exclusively to playing concerts in 1988. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Mi Corazón al Aire&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;From Out of My Heart&amp;quot;, 1991) was his first record. An admirer of [[Paco de Lucía]] since childhood, Amigo took part with him in the show &amp;quot;Leyendas de la guitarra&amp;quot; (Legends of the Guitar) that was held in [[Seville]] as a foretaste of the Expo 92 exhibition, which also featured [[Paco de Lucía]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Steve Vai]], [[Joe Satriani]], [[Nuno Bettencourt]], [[Phil Manzanera]], [[Joe Cocker]], [[Jack Bruce]] and [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]]. By that time, he had already been awarded some of the most prestigious flamenco guitar prizes.

Vicente Amigo is open to experimenting, pursuing Flamenco to unprecedented limits, and gaining in-depth knowledge about other forms of music, and sharing experiences with other artists. He has taken part in recordings by [[Khaled (musician)|Khaled]], [[Miguel Bosé]], [[Carmen Linares]], [[Manolo Sanlúcar]], [[Wagner Tiso]], [[Rosario]], [[Nacho Cano]], [[Alejandro Sanz]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], etc., and has shared the stage with the greatest of contemporary artists: [[Paco de Lucía]], [[Stanley Jordan]], [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Al Di Meola]], [[Milton Nascimento]].
