&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vivian Mercier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1919&amp;amp;ndash;1989) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[literary critic]]. He was born in [[Clara]], [[County Offaly]], [[Ireland]] and educated first at [[Portora Royal School]], [[Enniskillen]], [[Co. Fermanagh]], and then at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. He became a Scholar of the College and edited the student magazine [[T.C.D. Miscellany]].

After taking his doctorate at Trinity, he taught in American universities from the 1940s to the 1980s; his last post was Professor of English at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is perhaps best known for his famous summation of the plot of [[Samuel Beckett]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Waiting for Godot]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: &amp;quot;... has achieved a theoretical impossibility—a play in which nothing happens, that yet keeps audiences glued to their seats. What&amp;apos;s more, since the second act is a subtly different reprise of the first, he has written a play in which nothing happens, twice.&amp;quot; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Irish Times]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 18 February 1956, p. 6.). Despite what may sound like a somewhat disparaging criticism, Mercier was one of the foremost Beckett scholars of his day, and wrote extensively about &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Godot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He also wrote a critically acclaimed study of Beckett&amp;apos;s work as a whole, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Beckett/Beckett&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Mercier died in 1989, the same year as Beckett. His last marriage (1974-1989) was to the Irish novelist and children&amp;apos;s writer [[Eilís Dillon]], who edited his posthumous book, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Modern Irish Literature: Sources and Founders&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Oxford, 1994). He is buried beside his wife in his hometown of [[Clara]].
