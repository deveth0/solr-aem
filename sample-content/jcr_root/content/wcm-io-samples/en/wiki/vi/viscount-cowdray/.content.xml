&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscount Cowdray&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Cowdray in the County of [[West Sussex]], is a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created in 1917 for the industrialist [[Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray|Weetman Pearson, 1st Baron Cowdray]], head of the [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]] conglomerate. He had already been created a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baronet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Paddockhurst, in the Parish of Worth, in the County of Sussex, and of Airlie Gardens, in the Parish of St Mary Abbots, Kensington, in the County of London, on 26 June 1894, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Cowdray&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Midhurst in the County of Sussex, in 1910. His son, the second Viscount, sat as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Eye (UK Parliament constituency)|Eye]]. His son, the third Viscount, after serving in [[World War II]] where he lost an arm, was Chairman of the family firm of [[Pearson PLC|Pearson Plc]] from 1954 to 1977. {{As of|2010}} the titles are held by the latter&amp;apos;s son, the fourth Viscount, who succeeded in 1995.

The family seat is [[Cowdray House]], near [[Midhurst]], [[Sussex]], which the 4th Viscount put up for sale in 2011.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Why I&amp;apos;m swapping my £25m house for a cottage|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2015843/As-Lord-Cowdray-holds-exceedingly-grand-car-boot-sale--Why-Im-swapping-25m-house-cottage.html#axzz2Jq0OMTUy|newspaper=Daily Mail}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
