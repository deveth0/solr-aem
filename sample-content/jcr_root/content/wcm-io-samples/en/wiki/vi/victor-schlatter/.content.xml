        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Victor Schlatter&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a former nuclear scientist, church planter, missionary, and author. He is the author of [[Where is the Body?]] and [[Showdown of the Gods]].

Victor grew up in [[Portland, Oregon]], was trained at [[Purdue University|Purdue]], and eventually found himself working in a nuclear plant in Washington state. There he founded a church within the [[Apostolic Christian Church]] (Nazarean) denomination. In the late 1950s, Victor dedicated himself to a new vision, to reach the stone-age people of [[Papua New Guinea]] and translate the Bible into the [[Waola]] language. He and his wife Elsie spent 30 years in the country and produced an entire Bible and founded the [[Tiliba Christian Church]], which is currently composed of over one hundred churches.

Schlatter now resides in [[Australia]], where he still provides oversight and accountability to the [[Papua New Guinea]] churches and directs [[Southern Pacific Island Ministries]], which is dedicated to promoting a relationship between southern pacific island Christians and [[Israel]].
