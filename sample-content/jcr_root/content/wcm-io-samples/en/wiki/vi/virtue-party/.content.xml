&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Virtue Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-tr|Fazilet Partisi}}, FP) was an [[Islamism|Islamist]] political party established in December 1998 in [[Turkey]]. It was found unconstitutional by the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey|Constitutional Court]] and then banned in June 2001 for violating the secularist articles of the [[Constitution of Turkey|Constitution]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Atacan 2005, 188.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; After the party&amp;apos;s ban, the party MPs founded two sections of parties: reformist [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) and traditionalist [[Felicity Party]] (SP).

Founders of the Virtue Party were also active members of the [[National Order Party]] (MNP), [[National Salvation Party]] (MSP) and [[Welfare Party]] (RP). The Virtue Party was the first party in this tradition to have a genuine intra-party democracy in the nation.

[[Merve Kavakçı]], the female elected as the MP who was banned from swearing her [[oath]] in [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]] because she wore a [[hijab|headscarf]], was a Virtue Party member.
