The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Violaceous Trogon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Trogon violaceus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), also known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Guianan Trogon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a [[near passerine]] [[bird]] in the [[trogon]]  family, Trogonidae. It is found in humid forests in the [[Amazon Basin]] of [[South America]] and on the island of [[Trinidad]], although some authorities have argued for treating the west Amazonian population as a separate species, the Amazonian Trogon (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;T. ramonianus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). Until recently, the [[Gartered Trogon]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;T. caligatus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) of [[Mexico]], [[Central America]] and north-western South America was generally considered a [[subspecies]] of the Violaceous Trogon.

==Behavior==
It is a resident of moist tropical forests, where it nests in a [[wasp]], [[ant]] or [[termite]] nest or a hole in a rotten tree, with a typical clutch of two or three white eggs.

Violaceous Trogons feed on [[insect]]s and small [[fruit]], and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. They typically perch upright and motionless.

==Description==
[[File:Violaceous Trogon RWD7.jpg|left|thumb|Female in Panama]]
Trogons have distinctive male and female plumages, with soft, often colourful, feathers. This relatively small species is about {{convert|23|cm|in}} long and weighs {{convert|56|g|oz}}. The head and upper breast of the male are blue and the back is green, becoming bluer on the rump. A faint white line separates the breast from the orange yellow underparts. The undertail is white with black barring, and the wings are black, vermiculated with white. The complete eye-ring is yellow. The female Violaceous Trogon resembles the male, but has a dark grey back, head and breast, and an incomplete white eye-ring.

This species resembles the [[White-tailed Trogon]], but the latter is larger and has a complete pale blue eye-ring in both sexes. Furthermore, the male White-tailed Trogon lacks barring to the undertail.

The shade of the blue of the head in the male differs between the Violaceous Trogon and the Gartered Trogon, but (disregarding their separate distributions) the call is the main distinction between the two. The Gartered has a slurred whistled  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;cuh-cuh-cuh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and Violaceous has a soft &amp;apos;&amp;apos;cow cow, cow&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
