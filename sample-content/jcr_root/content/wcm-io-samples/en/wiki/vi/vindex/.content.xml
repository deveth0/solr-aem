&amp;lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Vindex - denarius - RIC 0072.jpg|thumb|[[Denarius]] minted during the revolt of Vindex with legend &amp;quot;salvation of mankind&amp;quot;.]] --&amp;gt;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gaius Iulius Vindex&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of a noble Gaulish family of [[Aquitania]] given senatorial status under [[Claudius]], was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] governor in the province of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]].  In either late 67 or early 68, he rebelled against the tax policy of the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Nero]].  According to the historian [[Cassius Dio]], Vindex &amp;quot;was powerful in body and of shrewd intelligence, was skilled in warfare and full of daring for any great enterprise; and he had a passionate love of freedom and a vast ambition&amp;quot; (Cassius Dio, 63.22.1-2). In order to gain support, he declared his allegiance to the then governor of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], [[Servius Sulpicius Galba]], as the new emperor.  Vindex was defeated and killed by the commander of the [[Germania Superior]] army, [[Lucius Verginius Rufus]], in a battle near Vesontio (modern [[BesanÃ§on]]).

By June 68, military support for Galba led to Nero committing suicide. Galba, acclaimed by the Senate, struck coins to commemorate Vindex, to whom he owed his position as emperor.

==Current Fame==
Today, Vindex is a favorite of many students of the [[Latin]] language and Roman history worldwide. In classical Latin, &amp;apos;v&amp;apos;s are pronounced as &amp;apos;w&amp;apos;s, making C. Julius Vindex&amp;apos;s name sound comically similar to the cleaning solution [[Windex]]. He is a special favorite of members of the [[National Junior Classical League]], a group of grammar- and high-school students interested in the classics, and frequently appears in their academic tests or competitive trivia questions, called [[Certamen]].
