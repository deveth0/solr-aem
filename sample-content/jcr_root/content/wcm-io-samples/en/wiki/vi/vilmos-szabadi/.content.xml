        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vilmos Szabadi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, sometimes referred to as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wilhelm Szabadi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1959) is a  [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[violin]]ist.

Szabadi studied under Professor Ferenc Halász at the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]] in [[Budapest]] where on receiving his diploma, he became the youngest-ever member to join the teaching staff. Then he studied, after graduation, with [[Sándor Végh]], [[Ruggiero Ricci]] and Loránt Fenyves. In 1982 he won first prize (with special mention) in the [[Hungarian Radio]] Violin Competition and the following year in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Jenő Hubay]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; competition in Budapest. In 1985 Szabadi was awarded 3rd prize at the [[international Jean Sibelius Violin Competition]] in [[Finland]] where he has since been invited to perform regularly and to give master classes.

His career as an international concert violinist took off when [[Sir Georg Solti]] invited him to play [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]]&amp;apos;s [[Violin Concerto No. 2 (Bartók)|2nd Violin Concerto]] during a Bartók Festival at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London in 1988. The success of the concert (which was recorded by [[Philips]]), led to invitations from the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[BBC Philharmonic]] and the [[RTÉ Concert Orchestra]]. Szabadi was among the musicians invited by HRH [[Prince Charles]] to perform at the celebration in honour of Sir Georg Solti&amp;apos;s 80th birthday held at [[Buckingham Palace]] in 1992.

He has played in the following countries;
*Austria: [[Wiener Konzerthaus]], [[Musikverein]]
*Belgium: Brussels-  Theatre St.Michel
*England: London- [[Wigmore Hall]], [[Barbican Centre]], and [[Royal Festival Hall]]; Manchester- [[Royal Northern College of Music]]

Conductors with whom he has appeared include Simonov, Ceccato, Nelson, Gardelli, Tabachnik, Loughran, Berglund, Renzetti, Kamu, Haenchen, Vásáry, Kobajashi, Adam and Ivan Fisher.
He has recorded for the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;BBC&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Radio Classique&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (France), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;NDR&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (North German Radio), BRD (Bavarian Radio), Irish Radio, and lots of other Radio and TV stations.
He was the recipient of the [[Franz Liszt prize]] in 1993.

==Discography==
He is the double prize-winner (1999, 2002) of the [[MIDEM]] Festival in [[Cannes]], France, where the international jury chose the Szabadi recording of [[Ernő Dohnányi|Dohnányi]] Violin Concertos, and the complete Bartók edition (issued by [[Hungaroton]], the Hungarian record company) which includes Szabadi&amp;apos;s version of the early Bartók violin sonata.
So far he has recorded 45 CDs / LPs / CDVs for several companies. From 1996 he has been the only violinist in Hungary to be contracted as an exclusive artist for the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hungaroton Classic&amp;apos;&amp;apos; record label.  In 1999 the Hungaroton Prize was awarded to him.

==Instrument==
Szabadi usually plays an instrument on loan from the Hungarian state collection -  a [[Lorenzo Storioni]] violin made in [[Cremona]] in 1778. However, in 1995 he appeared in a &amp;quot;[[Stradivarius]] Series&amp;quot; in Madrid, playing one of the &amp;quot;Strad&amp;quot; instruments housed in the Royal Palace ([[Palacio Real]]).

==Chamber music==
In 1995 Szabadi established, as Artistic Director, a chamber music festival in [[Keszthely]], a resort on Lake Balaton.  He still teaches at Keszthely but the festival moved to the baroque palace at [[Gödöllő]] near Budapest.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;herald&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23746511.html | title=Waiting for Godollo | publisher=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Herald&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]].
