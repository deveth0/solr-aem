&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vianen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-nl|viˈjaːnə(n)}}) is a [[municipality]] and a [[city]] in the central [[Netherlands]], in the province of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]. It is the only municipality in Utrecht located south of the [[Lek River]]. Before 2002 it was part of the province of [[South Holland]]. Vianen is bordered by two major [[motorway]]s leading to Utrecht: the [[A2 motorway (Netherlands)|A2]] (Amsterdam-Maastricht) on its west, and the [[A27 motorway (Netherlands)|A27]] (Breda-Almere) just east of the town. Both roads can be notoriously congested near Vianen during peak commute hours.

[[Image:Vianen.Lekpoort.jpg|thumb|left|130px|City gate (15th century)]]
Vianen received [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] in 1337. Vianen thrived under the counts of Brederode, who acquired its lordship through marriage early in the 15th century. It formed a self-proclaimed sovereign seignory till 1795, including Vianen, Lexmond, Hei- en Boeicop and Meerkerk. During the Middle Ages, as a &amp;quot;free city,&amp;quot; Vianen could be a haven for felons and escaped serfs. Of the three castles built during the town&amp;apos;s history, Castle Batestein was said to be one of the most beautiful in the Netherlands. Its only remnants are a 17th-century brick gate and water-pump. Remnants of the old city wall are visible girdling parts of the old downtown.

Vianen celebrates its [[city rights]] every year in October with a horse-market. Besides the horses there are also other activities on this day, such as a fair and [[market]] and traditional Dutch games.
