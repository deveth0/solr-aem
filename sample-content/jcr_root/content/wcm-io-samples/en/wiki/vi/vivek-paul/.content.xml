===Wipro===
In 1999, Paul was asked to run Wipro&amp;apos;s software unit in India.  Wipro was a $150-million company when Vivek Paul took over, and it had all the tendencies of a small, traditional company.

Shortly after a May 6 offsite event at Goa&amp;apos;s Hotel Marriott, Paul began telling colleagues of his intention to leave Wipro.  On June 29, he formally put in his papers. The following day, Wipro announced that Paul was leaving and that [[Dr A L Rao]], would become the chief operating officer.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/vivek-paul-logs-outwipro-after-six-years/216739/|title=Vivek Paul logs out of Wipro after six years|date=July 1, 2005|publisher=Business Standard|accessdate=2005-01-07}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
