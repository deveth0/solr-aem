&amp;lt;br&amp;gt; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Norges historie fremstillet for det norske folk I-2&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1910)]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vingulmark&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Old Norse &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vingulmörk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is the old name for the area in Norway which today makes up the counties of [[Østfold]], western parts of [[Akershus]] (excluding [[Romerike]]), and eastern parts of [[Buskerud]] ([[Hurum]] and [[Røyken]] municipalities), and includes the site of Norway&amp;apos;s capital, [[Oslo]]. During the Middle Ages, Vingulmark was an administrative unit limited to [[Oslo]], [[Bærum]] and [[Asker]].
==History==
According to medieval [[kings&amp;apos; sagas]], it was a [[Viking Age]] [[petty kingdom]]. Vingulmark was one of the four counties under the Court of Law, which together constituted the ancient landscape of [[Viken, Norway|Viken]]. Archaeologists have made finds of richly endowed burials in the area around the estuary of the river [[Glomma]], at [[Onsøy]], [[Rolvsøy]] and [[Tune, Norway|Tune]], where the remains of a ship, the [[Tune ship]], was found. This indicates that there was an important center of power in this area.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Bergljot Solberg, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jernalderen i Norge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (Oslo,2000), p. 279&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

There are indications that at least the southern part of this area was under Danish rule in the late 9th century. In the account of [[Ohthere of Hålogaland|Ottar]], which was written down at the court of the English king [[Alfred the Great]], Ottar says that when he sailed south from [[Skiringssal]], he had Denmark on the port side for three days. This would include parts of Vingulmark.

Snorri Sturluson writes in [[Heimskringla]] and [[Fagrskinna]], that King [[Harald Fairhair]] inherited part of Vingulmark from his father [[Halfdan the Black]]. King Harald defeated King [[Gandalf Alfgeirsson|Gandalf]], who had previously held half of Vingulmark. [[Snorri Sturluson]] relates in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Heimskringla]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; that the area was also claimed by the Swedish King [[Erik Emundsson]]. The   Norwegians  invaded [[Götaland]] to defend their claim.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://omacl.org/Heimskringla/halfdan.html &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Halfdan the Black Saga&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Heimskringla or The Chronicle of the Kings of Norway)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://omacl.org/Heimskringla/harfager.html &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Harald Harfager&amp;apos;s Saga&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Heimskringla or The Chronicle of the Kings of Norway)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Legendary rulers==
The sagas name several more or less legendary kings as rulers of Vingulmark:
* [[Gudrød the Hunter]], half of Vingulmark
* Alfgeir (Old Norse: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Álfgeir&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)
* [[Gandalf Alfgeirsson]]
* [[Halfdan the Black]]
* [[Olaf Haraldsson Geirstadalf|Olaf Haraldsson]]
* [[Tryggve Olafsson]]
* [[Harald Gudrødsson Grenske]], 976-987

==The name==
The [[Norse language|Norse]] form of the name was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vingulmǫrk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The first part of the name, Vingul, is somewhat uncertain. The first element is assumed to be the old name of the inner part of [[Oslofjord]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vingull&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). The name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vingull&amp;apos;&amp;apos; could be derived from a word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;vingr&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;swing, turn&amp;apos; (see &amp;gt; [[Vinger]]): The inner part of Oslofjord is shaped like a [[Fish hook|hook]].

Last element of the name, mark or mork (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;mǫrk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), is also from Old Norse period. It is interpreted to mean woodland, borderland or threshold, signifying the border area between villages. Presumably, such a designation separated the two parts of the landscape that is today called Østfold.
