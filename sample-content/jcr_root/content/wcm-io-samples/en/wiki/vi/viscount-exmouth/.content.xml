&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscount Exmouth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Canonteign in the County of Devon, is a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created in 1816 for the prominent naval commander [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Edward Pellew, 1st Baron Exmouth]]. He had already been created a baronet in the [[Baronetage of Great Britain]] on 18 March 1796 for rescuing the crew of the [[East Indiaman]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dutton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. After a succession of commands culminating as Commander of the Mediterranean Fleet he was created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Exmouth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Canonteign in the County of Devon, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1814. He was created a Viscount, with the same designation, for the successful [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|Bombardment of Algiers]] in 1816 which secured the release of the 1,000 Christian slaves in the city.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Viscount, who represented [[Launceston (UK Parliament constituency)|Launceston]] in Parliament. On the death in 1922 of his great-great-grandson, the fifth Viscount, this line of the family failed. He was succeeded by his ninety-four year old first cousin twice removed, [[Henry Pellew|the sixth Viscount]]. He was the son of the Very Reverend Hon. [[George Pellew]], [[Dean of Norwich]], third son of the first Viscount. On the death of his son, the seventh Viscount, this line also failed.

The title then passed to the seventh Viscount&amp;apos;s second cousin, the eighth Viscount. He was the grandson of Reverend the Hon. Edward Pellew, fourth son of the first Viscount. His son, the ninth Viscount, married Maria Luisa Urquijoy y Losada, Marquesa de Olias, a title created by [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] in the [[Spanish nobility|Peerage of Spain]] in 1652. They were both succeeded by their son, the tenth and ({{As of|2010}}) present Viscount.
