&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vincent Brome&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (pronounced &amp;apos;broom&amp;apos;) (14 July 1910 â€“ 16 October 2004) was an English writer, who gradually established himself as a [[man of letters]]. He is best known for a series of biographies of politicians, writers and followers of [[Sigmund Freud]]. He also wrote numerous novels, and was a [[dramatist]].

He was born and brought up in London, and educated at [[Streatham]] Grammar School and [[Elleston]] School. He failed to enter university, and was found a job at a [[tea]] broker. He left home at 18 determined to write for a living. He took up residence in [[Bloomsbury]], where he would live for the rest of his life.

==Early career==
Brome began his career as a journalist and magazine editor, his first short story anthology was published in 1936. Having been declared unfit for active duty, he worked for the British [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] during [[World War II]]. After the war Brome worked under [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] researcher.

==Literary career==
Following the electoral success of the Labour Party in 1945, Brome turned his hand to biography writing. Fittingly, his first subject was the new [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]: [[Clement Attlee]]. He went on to receive some critical and commercial success with his second work, [[H.G. Wells]] in 1950. Brome went on to chronicle the lives of such men as [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Frank Harris]], [[J. B. Priestley]], and [[Havelock Ellis]] to wide acclaim. Two of his literary works, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Surgeon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Embassy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, were international bestsellers. However, his works were not always treated so kindly by critics; his biography of [[Aneurin Bevan]] was particularly poorly received.

Brome was a regular at the [[British Library]], and was a member of its advisory committee from 1975 until 1982. He was a vocal supporter of the library&amp;apos;s move from the [[British Museum]] to its own purpose built building in [[St Pancras, London|St. Pancras]], even writing numerous letters to such organs as [[The Times]] and the [[Times Literary Supplement]] praising the move.

At the time of his death Brome still occupied the third story flat he had lived in for fifty years despite growing frailty and deafness.
