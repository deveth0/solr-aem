&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vicente Alberto Pernía&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born April 25, 1949 in [[Tandil]], [[Buenos Aires Province]]), known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;El Tano&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the [[Italy|Italian]], in [[lunfardo]]), is a former [[Argentina|Argentine]] professional [[football (soccer)|footballer]]. He then went on to a second career as a [[car racing]] driver.

==Club career==

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;El Tano&amp;apos;&amp;apos; started his football career with [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] in 1969, where he played until his transfer to [[Boca Juniors]] in 1973. During his time at Boca Pernía won a number of titles, including 3 league titles and 2 [[Copa Libertadores]]. Pernía played a total of 269 games for Boca in all competitions and still holds the record for the Boca player to have been sent off the most times with 13 red cards. After the chain of successes under coach [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]], he was sold to [[Club Atlético Vélez Sársfield|Vélez Sársfield]] at the end of 1981 after being left out of new coach [[Silvio Marzolini]]&amp;apos;s plans.

Pernía retired from playing football in 1982. His son [[Mariano Pernía|Mariano]] is also a football player and was a member of the [[Spain national football team]] for [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].

==International career==
Pernía was widely hailed as the best Argentine right defender of his time, but [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]] coach [[César Menotti]] chose not to call him to the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] squad, after some rude altercations in friendly matches, notably a friendly against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] played 18 June 1977, when he was sent off for repeated violent fouls against [[Willie Johnston]] [http://sport.scotsman.com/sport/Scotland-v-Argentina-the-story.4706879.jp].

For the main event, Menotti improvised fullback [[Jorge Olguín]] in the position. Olguín played both the 1978 and the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]]s. It was rumored that the personal preferences of some members of the military [[military dictatorship|junta]] that ruled Argentina played a part in the decision.

In a popular sketch on TV, comedian [[Mario Sapag]] as Menotti would say that Pernía does not fit in his philosophy of play &amp;quot;because he is sad&amp;quot;, and he&amp;apos;d rather have Olguín, whose name itself is funny.

==Titles==
*[[Primera División Argentina|Metropolitano]] 1981
*[[Copa Libertadores]] 1978
*[[European/South American Cup|Intercontinental Cup]] 1977
*[[Copa Libertadores]] 1977
*[[Primera División Argentina|Metropolitano]] 1976
*[[Primera División Argentina|Nacional]] 1976

==Stock-car racing==
In the 1980s, Pernía reinvented himself as a stock-car driver in Argentina&amp;apos;s [[Turismo Carretera|TC]] and [[TC2000]] categories. He won a few races, obtaining in 1996 the Subchampionship of [[Turismo Carretera]].

In 2005, Argentine football giants [[Boca Juniors]] and [[CA River Plate|River Plate]] prepared their own racing teams for the [[Top Race V6]] competition that starts in March 2005. Pernía will, after 14 years, dress again the blue-and-yellow colors of Boca Juniors, along with driving [[Guillermo Ortelli]] and [[Ernesto Bessone]].

Another of Pernía&amp;apos;s sons, [[Leonel Pernía|Leonel]] races in TC2000 and the [[World Touring Car Championship]].
