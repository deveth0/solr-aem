&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscount of Arbuthnott&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a title in the [[Peerage of Scotland]]. It was created in 1641, along with the subsidiary title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lord Inverbervie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, for Sir Robert Arbuthnot.

The Viscount of Arbuthnott is the hereditary [[Scottish clan chief|Clan Chief]] of [[Clan Arbuthnott]].

The family seat is [http://www.arbuthnott.co.uk/images/ArbHouse/arbhouse.htm Arbuthnott House], [[Arbuthnott]], near [[Inverbervie]], [[Kincardineshire]] ([[Aberdeenshire (unitary)|Aberdeenshire]]).

Kincardineshire was a Scottish shire (later known as a county), which had previously been represented by two commissioners in the former Parliament of Scotland. The constituency included the whole shire, except for the [[Royal burgh]] of [[Inverbervie]] which formed part of the Aberdeen Burghs constituency.

All Viscounts in the Peerage of Scotland have &amp;quot;of&amp;quot; in their titles, but most Scottish Viscounts have dropped the practice of using &amp;quot;of.&amp;quot; The only ones who persist in the usage of the word are the Viscount of Arbuthnott, and, to a lesser extent, the [[Viscount of Oxfuird]].

==Coat of arms==
The heraldic [[blazon]] for the [[coat of arms]] of the viscountcy is: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Azure a crescent between three mullets argent&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This can be translated as: a blue shield containing a silver crescent with three silver stars around it.
