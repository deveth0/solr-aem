&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xargon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xargon: The Mystery of the Blue Builders&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 1993 [[video game]] trilogy produced by Epic MegaGames (now [[Epic Games]]) for [[IBM PC compatible|PCs]] running [[MS-DOS]]. It was programmed by Allen Pilgrim.  The graphics were created by Joe Hitchens, who also contributed to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Epic Pinball]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Jill of the Jungle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The game is a [[side-scrolling game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] very similar to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jill of the Jungle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but with improved graphics. The main character, Malvineous Havershim, must journey through strange landscapes as he seeks to destroy the evil Xargon.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Volume One: Beyond Reality&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was released as [[shareware]], but &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Volume Two: The Secret Chamber&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Volume Three: Xargon&amp;apos;s Fury&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; had to be purchased commercially.

The game was a contemporary of such games as [[Id Software]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Commander Keen]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Duke Nukem II]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Allen Pilgrim declared the registered version [[freeware]] on August 4, 2008.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.classicdosgames.com/game/Xargon.html] Allen Pilgrim declared &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xargon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; freeware and released the source code.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Storyline==
Malvineous Havershim is an archaeologist studying strange ruins in [[Madagascar]]. The ruins were built by an unknown ancient culture known as the &amp;apos;Blue Builders&amp;apos;. While attempting to translate the [[glyph]]s on the walls of one Blue Builder structure, a strange gas is emitted, and Malvineous loses consciousness.

Malvineous then has a dream-encounter with a talking eagle, who gives him cryptic warnings. He awakes in a strange land, the area in which the game takes place.

==Gameplay==
The basic goal of the game is to advance through the map by completing levels. To finish a level, the player must find and reach the exit, which is found by traversing throughout the level.

Initially, Malvineous is armed with a &amp;quot;laser bullet&amp;quot;, allowing only one shot on-screen at a time and it can be slightly controlled by pressing up or down, in which the laser bullet will slightly advance upwards or downwards. Other weapons include more laser bolts which allows Malvineous to shoot more often, rapid fire, rocks which can be thrown more strategically, and powerful fireballs which make short work of most enemies.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xargon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is unique in the sense that you can purchase items at any point during the game granted you have the emeralds to spend. Emeralds are randomly placed in most levels. Purchasable items include health units, invincibility, and weapon upgrades.

In most of the levels there are gift boxes, that either explode when you shoot them or contain fruit or other valuable items or nothing at all. Points are earned by collecting fruit, killing monsters, and collecting the four EPIC pool balls. More points are earned if the EPIC pool balls are collected in order.

Malvineous can take 5 hits, and if he dies the player must start the level over again. His health can be restored by collecting a beating heart or collecting 16 fruits which restores one health unit or purchasing a health unit. Spike pits, water, acid and various other dangers kill Malvineous instantly if he touches them.

==Reception==
The game was reviewed in 1994 in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; #204 by [[Sandy Petersen]] in the &amp;quot;Eye of the Monitor&amp;quot; column. Petersen gave the game 2 out of 5 stars.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Dragon204&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal|title=Eye of the Monitor|author=[[Sandy Petersen|Petersen, Sandy]]|journal=Dragon
