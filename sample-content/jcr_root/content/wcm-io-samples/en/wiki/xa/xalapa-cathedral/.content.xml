&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xalapa Cathedral&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or in full, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Catedral Metropolitana de la Immaculada Concepción de Xalapa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a Roman Catholic cathedral in the city of [[Xalapa]], [[Veracruz]], in eastern [[Mexico]]. The [[Episcopal see|see ]] of the  [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Jalapa|Metropolitan Archdiocese of Xalapa]], it is one of the oldest constructions of the city.

The cathedral was originally built in 1641, but in 1772 it underwent massive change that reconstructed it in the [[baroque]] style. Some details in some parts of cathedral remain from this, including the bell tower. The clock itself was imported from England. The consecration of the status of cathedral was announced in 1864, coinciding with the creation of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Xalapa to support it. In 1896, it underwent further modification forming an appearance, much of which remains today.
