&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xanthochromia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [from the Greek &amp;apos;&amp;apos;xanthos (ξανθός)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;=yellow and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;chroma (χρώμα)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;=colour], is the yellowish appearance of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (which envelops the [[brain]]) in particular medical conditions, especially [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]].&amp;lt;ref name=Cruickshank&amp;gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cruickshank A, Auld P, Beetham R, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;et al.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; |title=Revised national guidelines for analysis of cerebrospinal fluid for bilirubin in suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage |journal=Ann. Clin. Biochem. |volume=45 |issue=Pt 3 |pages=238–44 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18482910 |doi=10.1258/acb.2008.007257 |url=http://acb.rsmjournals.com/cgi/content/full/45/3/238}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The most effective test for SAH is [[computed tomography]] (CT, a type of brain scan), but this identifies only 98% of cases in the first 12 hours after the symptoms and becomes less useful afterwards. Therefore, obtaining cerebrospinal fluid (after a CT scan) by [[lumbar puncture]] is recommended if someone has characteristic symptoms (e.g. a [[thunderclap headache]]) but no blood visible on the CT.&amp;lt;ref name=Cruickshank/&amp;gt;  According to one article it is not necessary if the images were taken with a third generation CT scan in the first six hours after the onset of the symptoms and no blood is present on the scan.  However, this is not standard of care.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite journal|author=Perry JJ, Stiell IG, Sivilotti ML, Bullard MJ, Emond M, Symington C, Sutherland J, Worster A, Hohl C, Lee JS, Eisenhauer MA, Mortensen M, Mackey D, Pauls M, Lesiuk H, Wells GA. |title=Sensitivity of computed tomography performed within six hours of onset of headache for diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage: prospective cohort study. |journal=BMJ |year=2011|month=July |doi=10.1136/bmj.d42777 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4277}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The yellow appearance is caused by [[red blood cell]]s entering the CSF during the bleeding. The cells are eventually destroyed by the body, releasing their oxygen-carrying molecule [[heme]], which is degraded by [[enzyme]]s into the yellow-green pigment [[bilirubin]]. Heme from red blood cells that enter the CSF for a different reason, e.g., because a small blood vessel was damaged during the lumbar puncture, has no time to be digested in this fashion, and bilirubin is therefore absent. Many laboratories rely on the color of the fluid alone when reporting the presence or absence of xanthochromia.&amp;lt;ref name=Edlow&amp;gt;{{Cite web|author=Edlow JV | url=http://www.webmm.ahrq.gov/case.aspx?caseID=69 |title=The Worst Headache |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |work=Morbidity &amp;amp; Mortality Rounds on the Web |date=July 2004| accessdate=2008-06-22}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Recent guidelines, however, suggest that [[spectrophotometry]] should be performed. This relies on the fact that bilirubin absorbs light of wavelengths between 450–460&amp;amp;nbsp;nm.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|author=Petzold A, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;et al.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|title=Spectrophotometry for xanthochromia|journal=N Engl J Med|year=2004|volume=351|pages=1695&amp;amp;ndash;1696}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Two related substances that are also released when heme is metabolized are [[oxyhemoglobin]] and [[methemoglobin]] (the absorption ranges are 410-418&amp;amp;nbsp;nm and 403-410&amp;amp;nbsp;nm respectively) may also be detected during this process.,&amp;lt;ref name=Cruickshank/&amp;gt; Xanthochromia is not seen in traumatic tap.

There are other causes for xanthochromia.&amp;lt;ref name=Edlow/&amp;gt;
