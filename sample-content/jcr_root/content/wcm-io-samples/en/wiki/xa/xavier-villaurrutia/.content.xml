&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xavier Villaurrutia y González&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (27 March 1903 – 31 December 1950) was a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[poet]] and [[playwright]], whose most famous works are the short theatrical dramas, called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Autos profanos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, compiled in the work &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Poesía y teatro completos&amp;apos;&amp;apos; published in 1953.

== Early life ==
Xavier Villaurrutia was born in Mexico City in 1903. He studied in the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria ([[National Preparatory School]]) and in the Escuela de Jurisprudencia (Jurisprudence School). During that time, he felt a certain affinity to writing so he decided to dedicate his life to writing literature.

In 1928 he joined the [[Los Contemporáneos|grupo de los Contemporáneos ( Contemporaries)]].  In 1935, he received a scholarship to study in the [[Yale University]] where he studied Theatre. Returning to Mexico in 1937, he started working for the local newspaper &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Letras de Mexico&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Alongside with [[Salvador Novo]], they founded the magazine &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ulises&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1927.

== Professional achievements ==
Professionally, Villaurrutia worked for the Mexican literary review &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Los Contemporáneos|Contemporáneos]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (literally &amp;quot;Contemporaries&amp;quot;) from 1928 to 1931. Villaurrutia would later found the first [[experimental theater]] in Mexico.

==Notable works==
Villaurrutia&amp;apos;s notable works include his poetic writings beginning with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reflejos&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1926 and  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nocturnos&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1933. Villaurrutia&amp;apos;s writing becomes darker in his later poetic works: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nostalgia de la muerte&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (literally meaning &amp;quot;Nostalgia of the dead&amp;quot;) in 1938, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Décima muerte&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (literally &amp;quot;tenth death&amp;quot;) in 1941. It is unclear if this change was due to the increase turmoil in Europe that would lead to [[World War II]] or simply due to Villaurrutia&amp;apos;s increasing age. The preoccupation with death in Villaurrutia&amp;apos;s work would climax with his 1941 with his play &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Invitación à la muerte&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the title of which can be literally translated to &amp;quot;Invitation to the death&amp;quot; (see &amp;quot;References&amp;quot; below regarding Dr. Raymond Marion Watkins&amp;apos;s book which chronicles a history and analysis of this play, which Watkins demonstrates was heavily influenced by Villaurrutia&amp;apos;s integration of dramatic elements traceable to William Shakespeare&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Hamlet.&amp;quot;)  The final published work of Villaurrutia would come posthumously in 1953 with the publication of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Poesía y teatro completos&amp;apos;&amp;apos; a collection of his works which included the short theatrical dramas, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Autos profanos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 1993, [[Copper Canyon Press]] published [[Eliot Weinberger]]&amp;apos;s translation of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nostalgia for Death&amp;apos;&amp;apos; along with Esther Allen&amp;apos;s translation of [[Octavio Paz]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hieroglyphs of Desire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a book-length study of Villaurrutia&amp;apos;s work.

==Inspiration==
Xavier Villaurrutia was greatly influenced by the work of [[Ramón López Velarde]] as well as by several other Mexican poets. He has been a mayor influence for many poets, like Octavio Paz (who was his student) and Alí Chumacero.

==Commemoration==
Since 1955 there has been a [[Xavier Villaurrutia Award]] for literary works published in Mexico, selected by a jury of writers. This award has been sponsored by the [[Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes]] since 1991.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.literaturainba.com/premios/xavier_villaurrutia.htm &amp;apos;&amp;apos;El Premio Xavier Villaurrutia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;] - in Spanish&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
