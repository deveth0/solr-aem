The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xavier Aptitude Test&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (XAT) is a national level aptitude test conducted in India by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[XLRI]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (formerly known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xavier Labour Relations Institute&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), a [[business school]] in [[Jamshedpur]] in the state of [[Jharkhand]] in India, as an entrance test for its management programmes.

==Pattern==
XAT 2013 was a three hour long exam. It was divided into an initial section of two hours and twenty minutes, consisting of multiple-choice questions that tested Quantitative Ability (Mathematics), Verbal Ability (English) and Data Interpretation/Logical Reasoning skills and a final section of 40 minutes which contained General Awaremess questions and an Essay question.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.xatonline.net.in/faq.aspx&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The XAT is quite similar to the [[Common Admission Test|Common Admission Test (CAT)]] conducted by the [[Indian Institutes of Management|IIMs]], except that the CAT has no Essay and General Awareness sections.

XLRI Jamshedpur has about 240 seats in its flagship BM (Business Management) and PMIR (Personnel Management and Industrial Relations) programmes and 120 seats in its flagship 15 months full-time residential GMP (General Management Program). The PMIR program has been renamed HRM (Human Resource Management). Apart from XLRI, 60 other institutes accept XAT scores for selection of candidates to their respective programmes. About 1,03,427 students appeared for the XAT exam in 2010. Candidates were surprised to note differential marking (1 marks to 5 marks) in XAT 2011 (Maximum Marks:252). The paper was very difficult compared to all other Management Entrance Exams. XAT 2012, held on 8th January 2012 had fewer questions in all three sections (Decision Making:25, Quantitative Ability:32 and Verbal Ability:28). XAT 2012 (Maximum Marks:100) also had differential marking with questions allotted marks either 1, 1.5 or 2. There was an essay question consisting of two statements on poverty, where the candidate was supposed to support one of them, giving justification and examples. The result of XAT comes in last week of January.
