        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xavier Beitia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1982-11-23) is an [[American football]] [[placekicker]] who last played for the [[Georgia Force]] of the [[Arena Football League (1987â€“2008)|Arena Football League]] (AFL) in 2007.  He played [[college football]] at [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] and signed with the [[New York Jets]] in 2004 and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in 2006.  Within NFL Europe, he played for the [[Berlin Thunder]].

==High school years==
Beitia attended [[Jesuit High School of Tampa]] in [[Tampa, Florida]] and kicked for coach Dominic Ciao. While in high school, he participated in the first ever [[U.S. Army All-American Bowl]] game in 2000.

==College career==
At Florida State, Beitia was well known for having missed a potential game-winning field goal against [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami (Fla.)]]. The kick went wide left as time expired in 2002, in what would continue the bizarre &amp;quot;[[Wide Right (Florida State)|Wide Right]]&amp;quot; saga. Beitia&amp;apos;s miss at the [[Miami Orange Bowl]] was dubbed &amp;quot;[[Wide Left I(Florida State)#Wide Left I|Wide Left I]],&amp;quot; and it affected him openly and deeply.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/10/13/Columns/For_FSU__same_sadness.shtml|title=For FSU, same sadness, but deeper|author=Gary Shelton|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|date=2002-10-13|accessdate=2010-09-26}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

More than one year later, Beitia missed another field goal in the [[Orange Bowl (game)|2004 Orange Bowl]] which would have given the Noles the lead with about five minutes left. The Miami Hurricanes went on to win that game, 16-14.

==Professional career==
In 2004, he signed with the New York Jets.  In 2006, Xavier became a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers being used as a punter, but not for field goals.   Tampa Bay sent him to NFL Europe that year, where he played for the Berlin Thunder.  He was released by Tampa Bay in August 2006.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E2D8113EF933A0575BC0A9609C8B63|title=Transactions|publisher=New York Times|date=2006-08-30|accessdate=2010-09-26}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Beitia went on to become a kicker for in the AFL for the Georgia Force, before being waived in May 2007.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/charleston-gazette-the/mi_8022/is_20070508/transactions/ai_n43247353/|title=Transactions|publisher=[[Charleston Gazette]]|date=2007-05-08|accessdate=2010-09-26}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
