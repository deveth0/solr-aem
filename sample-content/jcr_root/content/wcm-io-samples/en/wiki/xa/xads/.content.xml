        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;XADS&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xtreme Alternative Defense Systems&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a privately held firm in [[Anderson, Indiana]], [[USA]]. XADS is a  producer of NLDEW (Non-lethal (less than lethal) [[directed energy weapon]]s) for protecting and defending in military operations, law enforcement, site security, and peacekeeping. XADS was founded in 2002 after a proposal was submitted to the [[United States Marine Corps]].

XADS is developing a short-range wireless [[electroshock weapon]] called [[StunStrike]]. Contracts have been awarded to XADS to provide new solutions to problems on the battlefield.

XADS makes the Photonic Disruptor Series [http://www.xtremeads.com/photonic.htm]. It is called a Threat Assessment Laser Illuminator (TALI); but it can cause night-blindness and secondary effects such as [[nausea]]; it is claimed to leave no permanent eye damage.

== PD/G 105 ==
The Photonic Disruptor/Green 105 mW laser illuminator is XADS&amp;apos;s military grade laser. The laser runs off two AAA batteries and has a range of over 350 meters in darkness, with an operating life of 3000-5000 hours. The unit can be rail mounted for use with weapons. It is deployed in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan.
