        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xavier Coppolani&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[France|French]] [[Military of France|military]] and [[colonialism|colonial]] leader, who was instrumental in the colonial [[military occupation|occupation]] and creation of modern-day [[Mauritania]].

Born to [[Corsica]]n parents in French-ruled [[Algeria]], he was transferred to [[Senegal]] to lead the expansion of colonial rule north of the [[Senegal river]], where [[Moors|Moorish]] [[tribe]]s held firm against French rule. Their tribal rivalries provided Coppolani with an opportunity, and in 1901, he drew up a plan for moving into the territory with a combination of military and political strategies.

Alliances were drawn up with two of the main [[marabout]]s of the territory, Shaykh [[Sidya Baba]] and [[Shaykh]] [[Saad Bouh]], local leaders of [[Qadiriyya]] [[Sufi]] brotherhoods. They were promised a dominant role in the colonial administration and protection for their [[Zawiya]] tribes against the attacks of [[Hassane]] warriors. In return they would use their religious influence to persuade the local [[emir]]s to accept French rule. With military pressure applied, the strategy worked, and the [[emirate]]s of [[Tagant]], [[Emirate of Trarza|Trarza]] and [[Brakna]] all accepted French rule in 1903-04. The last emirate, in the northern zone of [[Adrar]], proved combative. It was also backed by a third influential Qadiriyya marabout, [[shaykh]] [[Ma al-&amp;apos;Aynayn]], himself in turn supported by the [[Sultan of Morocco|Sultan]] of [[Morocco]].

Coppolani was preparing to march on Adrar when he was [[assassinated]] in 1905, by a member of the shaykh&amp;apos;s [[Gudfiyya]] brotherhood. The emirate was eventually defeated and forcibly incorporated into Mauritania in 1912, by [[General]] [[Henri Gouraud (soldier)|Gouraud]], but tribal revolts and raids persisted until 1934.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The four previous paragraphs are taken from the Library of Congress country study of Mauritania, specifically Robert E. Handloff, ed. Mauritania: A Country Study.
