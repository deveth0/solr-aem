&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Good Shepherd Sunday&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the Fourth Sunday of [[Easter]] in the Catholic [[liturgical calendar]]; that is, the Sunday three weeks after [[Easter Sunday]]. The name derives from the [[gospel]] readings on this day which are taken from the [[Gospel of John|10th chapter]] of [[John the Apostle|John]]. In this reading [[Christ]] is described as the Good [[Shepherd]] who, by dying on the Cross, lays down his life for his sheep.  In the Traditional (pre-1970) Latin Liturgy (see [[Tridentine Mass]]), this Mass is said on the Second Sunday after Easter, i.e., the Sunday after &amp;quot;Low Week&amp;quot; (the week beginning with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quasimodo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;quot;Low&amp;quot; Sunday).

In recent times the feast day has also become known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vocations Sunday&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a day on which prayers should be said for vocations to the [[priesthood]] and religious life.

Those [[Protestants]] that follow the [[Revised Common Lectionary]], such as Lutherans, [[United Methodists]], Anglicans, and others also read the &amp;quot;Good Shepherd&amp;quot; passage from John chapter 10 on the Fourth Sunday of Easter and some also call this day &amp;quot;Good Shepherd Sunday.&amp;quot;
