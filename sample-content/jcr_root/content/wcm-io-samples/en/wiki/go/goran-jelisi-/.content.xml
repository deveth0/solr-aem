&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Goran Jelisić&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Горан Јелисић}}) (born June 7, 1968 in [[Bijeljina]], [[SR Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]]), nicknamed &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Serb Adolf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;, is a [[Bosnian Serb]] war criminal who was found guilty of having committed crimes against humanity and for violating the customs of war by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) at the [[Luka camp]] in [[Brčko (town)|Brčko]] during the [[Bosnian War]].&amp;lt;ref name=ICTY-CIS&amp;gt;[http://www.icty.org/x/cases/jelisic/cis/en/cis_jelisic.pdf Case Information Sheet JELISIC (IT-95-10)] ICTY&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Trial==

Jelisić was apprehended by the [[Stabilisation Force]] (SFOR) of [[NATO]] on 22 January 1998.&amp;lt;ref name=ICTY-CIS/&amp;gt; He faced trial for one count of genocide, sixteen counts of violating the customs of war and fifteen counts of crimes against humanity in relation to his involvement in the inhumane treatment and systematic killing of detainees at the Luka camp, where he was alleged to have, every day, &amp;quot;entered Luka’s main hangar, where most detainees were kept, selected detainees for interrogation, beat them and then often shot and killed them&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=ICTY-CIS/&amp;gt;

In 1999, he pleaded guilty to the charges of crimes against humanity and violating the customs of war.&amp;lt;ref name=ICTY-CIS/&amp;gt; He was acquitted on the charge of genocide as the court did not believe the prosecution had proved this beyond reasonable doubt. He was sentenced to 40 years imprisonment. The same sentence was confirmed by the appeals chamber.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.icty.org/sid/7729 Goran Jelisic acquitted of genocide and found guilty of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war] Press release, The Hague, 19 October 1999 JL/P.I.S./441-E&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On 29 May 2003, Jelisić was transferred to [[Italy]] to serve the remainder of his sentence with credit for time served since his arrest on 22 January 1998.&amp;lt;ref name=ICTY-CIS/&amp;gt;

==Personal life==

On 21 December 2011, Monika Ilić, nicknamed &amp;quot;Female Monster&amp;quot; and the wife of Goran, was detained on suspicion of having committed war crimes against non-Serbs in the Luka camp.&amp;lt;ref name=salon&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Bosnian Police Detain Female War Crimes Suspect|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-12-21/bosnia-woman-war-crimes/52138606/1|newspaper=USA Today|date=21 December 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
