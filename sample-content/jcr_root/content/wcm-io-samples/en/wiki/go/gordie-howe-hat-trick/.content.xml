In [[ice hockey]], a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gordie Howe Hat Trick&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a variation on the [[hat-trick]], wherein a player scores a [[goal (hockey)|goal]], records an [[assist (hockey)|assist]], and [[fighting in ice hockey|gets in a fight]] all in one game. It is named after [[Gordie Howe]], well known for his skill at both scoring and fighting.

The Gordie Howe hat trick is not an official statistic. Its conception is relatively recent; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Hockey News]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has statistics on it only since the [[1996–97 NHL season]]. The [[Detroit Red Wings]], [[San Jose Sharks]], [[Calgary Flames]], [[Nashville Predators]], [[Edmonton Oilers]], [[Ottawa Senators]], [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], [[Vancouver Canucks]], [[Montreal Canadiens]], [[Chicago Blackhawks]], [[Philadelphia Flyers]], [[New Jersey Devils]], [[Anaheim Ducks]], [[New York Rangers]], [[Carolina Hurricanes]], [[Los Angeles Kings]], [[Boston Bruins]], and the [[Washington Capitals]] are the list of [[NHL]] franchises that have recorded their Gordie Howe hat tricks. The [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] became the latest franchise to record such a feat when [[Brenden Morrow]] recorded one against the [[Montreal Canadiens]] on April 17, 2013.

The first known Gordie Howe hat trick was achieved by [[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Harry Cameron]] of the [[Toronto St. Pats]] on December 22, 1920.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;OGHHOF&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |last=Duplacey |first=James |last2=Zweig |first2=Eric |title=Official Guide to the Players of the Hockey Hall of Fame |publisher=Firefly Books |year=2010 |isbn=1-55407-662-5 |page=81}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The namesake of the achievement, Gordie Howe, achieved a Gordie Howe hat trick twice in his NHL career. Howe got his first Gordie Howe Hat Trick on October 11, 1953 when he fought the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]&amp;apos; [[Fernie Flaman]], assisted on [[Red Kelly]]&amp;apos;s goal, and scored his own. His second happened on March 21, 1954, once again versus the Maple Leafs. Howe scored the opening goal, assisted on two [[Ted Lindsay]] goals, and fought [[Ted Kennedy (ice hockey)|Ted &amp;quot;Teeder&amp;quot; Kennedy]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=514973 Going inside the “Gordie Howe Hat Trick”]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

According to the [[Society for International Hockey Research]], the all-time leader in Gordie Howe Hat Tricks is [[Brendan Shanahan]] with 17, [[Rick Tocchet]] has 15 and [[Brian Sutter]] with 12.  The active leader is [[Jarome Iginla]] of the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] with 9.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite magazine |title=Howe to Hat Trick |work=The Hockey News |date=2012-03-16 |volume=65 |number=20 |issn=0018-3016 |page=14}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

A double Gordie Howe hat trick occurred on January 10, 2012. [[Adam Henrique]] fought [[Jarome Iginla]]. Iginla recorded 1G, 2A while Henrique recorded 1G, 1A. It happened previously on March 9, 2010. [[Fedor Tyutin]] fought [[Ryan Getzlaf]] and Tyutin recorded 1G, 2A while Getzlaf recorded 1G, 1A.

A double Gordie Howe hat trick achieved by two players on the same team occurred on April 5, 2012 in a game between the [[Los Angeles Kings]] and [[San Jose Sharks]].  [[Joe Thornton]] and [[Ryane Clowe]] of the Sharks both recorded 1G 1A and 1 fight each.

A triple Gordie Howe hat trick occurred on November 14, 1992 in a game between [[Buffalo Sabres]] and [[New York Islanders]]. Tom Fitzgerald recorded 1G 1A, Wayne Presley recorded 1G 2A, Benoit Hogue recorded 2G 1A and all 3 players recorded fights.
