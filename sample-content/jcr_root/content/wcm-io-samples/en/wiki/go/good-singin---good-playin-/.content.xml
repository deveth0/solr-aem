&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Good Singin&amp;apos;, Good Playin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the final 1970s album by [[Grand Funk Railroad]], released by MCA Records (MCA 2216) in 1976.

The band had actually broken up, but after [[Frank Zappa]] expressed interest in producing an album for them, they managed to reassemble for one more attempt to regain a high chart position, which had become elusive as pop music became increasingly dominated by [[disco]].

Recorded in 1976 for [[MCA Records]], this album showed freshness and sheer dynamics, including a guest performance by Zappa himself, playing lead guitar on the song &amp;quot;Out to Get You&amp;quot;..  Although the pairing of rock stars Grand Funk, who had celebrated a good deal of commercial success, with multiple radio hits, and the esoteric Zappa seemed bizarre, Grand Funk drummer Don Brewer said, &amp;quot;His whole viewpoint on what rock and roll is all about is basically the same as ours.... Keep it as simple as possible and really bring the balls out of this thing.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Miles&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[[Barry Miles]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zappa: A Biography&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Grove Press, 2004, p. 254. ISBN 0-8021-1783-X.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Zappa said, &amp;quot;All I did was in a documentary way make a record which tells you exactly what they really sound like. For the first time on record you can hear Grand Funk Railroad ... and they&amp;apos;re fantastic, fan-tastic with an F three times taller than you!&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Miles&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  In spite of all this, or maybe because of it, Grand Funk decided on the first day of overdubs to split up again, although Zappa stayed up until 4 AM trying to talk them out of it.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Miles&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

The album wasn&amp;apos;t a commercial success, only making it to #52 in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Top 200.  Soon after, Grand Funk Railroad folded.
