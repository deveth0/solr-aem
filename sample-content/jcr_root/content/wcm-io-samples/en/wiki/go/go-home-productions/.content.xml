&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Go Home Productions&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;GHP&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is the alter ego of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mark Vidler&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a producer/[[remixer]]/DJ based in [[Watford]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]]. GHP has produced well over 200 [[bastard pop|mash-ups]] since May 2002, many of which have been played on both national and independent radio stations around the world.

GHP creations have been heard regularly on [[Xfm London]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Remix&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Rinse&amp;apos;&amp;apos; radio shows, and are heavily played on the [[New York City]] area station [[WFMU]]. A 30 minute Go Home Productions &amp;quot;Superchunk&amp;quot; mix was aired on Xfm in May 2003 to critical acclaim, and was voted &amp;quot;Superchunk of the year&amp;quot;. GHP has also been nominated for Best Studio Session on [[XFM]] alongside the likes of [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[Kings of Leon]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. GHP&amp;apos;s WFMU Re:Mixology set was broadcast as part of a series that included the legendary mixer [[Double Dee and Steinski|Steinski]].  Go Home Productions has worked with [[MTV]] Mash on their weekly bootleg video show and had five tracks on rotation across Europe in 2004. In the same year, [[Emap]]&amp;apos;s QTV also broadcast a selection of 8 GHP tracks across their network.

GHP&amp;apos;s 2005 mix &amp;quot;Rapture Riders&amp;quot; ([[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] vs [[The Doors]]) was not only approved by both bands, but has been re-remixed using the original studio tracks, and officially released both as a single and as a track on Blondie&amp;apos;s 2005 album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Greatest Hits: Sight + Sound&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It reached #1 on the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; US Hot Dance Club Play chart in May 2006, and charted in the top 40 of multiple worldwide singles charts, with continual play on numerous MTV channels; the ([[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] vs [[The Doors]]) video was directed by audiovisual artists [[Addictive TV]] who created a video mash-up of the two tracks.

Another mash-up that has received approval of the original artists involved is &amp;quot;Ray of Gob&amp;quot; which superimposes the vocals from [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Ray of Light&amp;quot; onto clips from several songs by the [[Sex Pistols]] (including &amp;quot;[[Pretty Vacant]]&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;[[Anarchy in the U.K.]]&amp;quot;).

Go Home Productions released a mash-up album on 12 February 2007 called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Mashed (album)|Mashed]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which featured previous hit tracks including &amp;quot;Rapture Riders&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Notorious Trick&amp;quot; - a mixed version of [[Kelis]] and [[Duran Duran]]. The album also included two tracks by Loo &amp;amp; Placido, most notably the chart hit &amp;quot;Horny as a Dandy&amp;quot;, featuring [[The Dandy Warhols]] and [[Mousse T]].

Turning his skills to AV, Vidler&amp;apos;s latest project is [[Addictive TV]] with fellow artist [[Graham Daniels]].
