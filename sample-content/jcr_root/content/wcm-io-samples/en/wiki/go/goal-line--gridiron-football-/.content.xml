[[Image:Steelers Chiefs goal line.jpg|thumb|320px|The [[Kansas City Chiefs]] (red) and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (black) line up for a play on the goal line.]]
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;goal line&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the chalked or painted line dividing the [[end zone]] from the field of play in [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]]. It is the line that must be crossed in order to score a [[touchdown]]

If any part of the ball reaches any part of the imaginary vertical plane transected by this line while [[in-bounds]] and in possession of a player whose team is striving toward that end of the field, this is considered a touchdown and scores six points for the team whose player has advanced the ball to, or recovered the ball in, this position. This is in contrast with other sports like [[Association football]] and [[ice hockey]], which require the puck or ball to pass completely over the goal line to count as a score.

If any member of the [[offensive team]] is [[down (football)|down]]ed while in possession of the ball behind his own team&amp;apos;s goal line, this is called a [[Safety (American football score)|safety]] and scores two points for the [[defensive team]].

If, during the course of play, a loose ball travels past the goal line and is recovered within the [[end zone]], then it is a touchdown if recovered by the kicking team, or a [[touchback]] if recovered and [[football down|down]]ed by the receiving team.

In the event of a kick recovered in one&amp;apos;s own end zone, the entirety of the ball must pass the goal line in order for the ball to be considered in the field of play, and not a touchback.
