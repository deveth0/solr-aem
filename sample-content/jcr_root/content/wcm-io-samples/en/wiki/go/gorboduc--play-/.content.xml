&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gorboduc&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ferrex and Porrex&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is an English play from 1561. It was first at the Christmas celebration given by the [[Inner Temple]] in 1561, and performed before [[Queen Elizabeth I]] on 18 January 1562, by the Gentlemen of the Inner Temple.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ribner, Irving. (1957) [books.google.com/books?id=l0LHz_Eki_IC&amp;amp;dq &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The English History Play In The Age Of Shakespeare&amp;apos;&amp;apos;], pp. 37-8.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The authors were [[Thomas Norton]] and [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Thomas Sackville]], said to be responsible for the first three Acts, and the final two, respectively.

The first [[book size|quarto]], published by the bookseller William Griffith, was published 22 September 1565.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Cauthen, I. B. (1962) &amp;quot;&amp;apos;Gorboduc, Ferrex and Porrex&amp;apos;&amp;quot;: The First Two Quartos&amp;quot;. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Studies in Bibliography&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;15&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: 231-3; p. 231.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; A second authorized quarto corrected by the authors followed in 1570 printed by [[John Day (printer)|John Day]] with the title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Tragedie of Ferrex and Porrex&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. A third edition was published in 1590 by [[Edward Allde]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ribner (1957) p. 38.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The play is notable for several reasons: as the first [[verse drama]] in [[English language|English]] to employ [[blank verse]]; for its political subject matter (the realm of [[Gorboduc]] is disputed by his sons [[Ferrex]] and [[Porrex I|Porrex]]), which was still a touchy area in the early years of Elizabeth&amp;apos;s reign; for its manner, progressing from the models of the [[morality play]] and [[Senecan tragedy]] in the direction which would be followed by later playwrights. That is, it can be seen as a forerunner of the whole trend that would later produce &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Titus Andronicus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[King Lear]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It is also provides the first well-documented performance of a play in [[Ireland]]: [[Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy]] staged it at [[Dublin Castle]] in 1601.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Gorboduc and Titus Andronicus; James D. Carroll, Notes and Queries, 2004, 51, 267-269.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Synopsis==
At the play&amp;apos;s beginning, the argument gives the following summary of the play&amp;apos;s action: &amp;quot;Gorboduc, King of Britain, divided his realm in his lifetime to his sons, Ferrex and Porrex.  The sons fell to dissention.  The younger killed the elder.  The mother that more dearly loved the elder, for revenge killed the younger.  The people, moved with the cruelty of the fact, rose in rebellion and slew both father and mother.  The nobility assembled and most terribly destroyed the rebels.  And afterward for want of issue of the prince, whereby the succession of the crown became uncertain, they fell to civil war in which both they and many of their issues were slain, and the land for a long time almost desolate and miserably wasted.&amp;quot;
