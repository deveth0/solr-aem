{{Politics of Fiji}}

Fiji was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Colonial Fiji|Crown Colony]] from 1874 to 1970, and an independent [[Dominion of Fiji|Dominion]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] from 1970 to 1987. During this period, the [[List of heads of state of Fiji|Head of State]] was the British Monarch, but in practice his or her functions were normally exercised locally by the [[Governor]] prior to independence (on 10 October 1970), and by the [[List of Governors-General of Fiji|Governor-General]] prior to the proclamation of a republic on 7 October 1987.

Note that from 1877 to 3 July 1952, Governors of Fiji were also [[High Commissioner for the Western Pacific|High Commissioners for the Western Pacific]].
