&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gorgonzola&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[comune]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the [[province of Milan]], part of [[Lombardy]], northern [[Italy]]. Once a rural community, and famous for the [[Gorgonzola (cheese)|cheese which bears its name]], today it forms part of the [[Milan]]ese [[conurbation]] and has three stations on the [[Milan Metro]], Villa Pompea, Gorgonzola and Cascina Antonietta, all of which are on the M2 line.

== History ==
In 453 the local &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[pieve]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the nearby town of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Argentia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were attacked  and destroyed by the [[Huns]]. The first written document mentioning &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gorgontiola&amp;apos;&amp;apos; dates from the 10th century. In 1176 it adhered to the [[Lombard League]], and, during the ensuing wars between [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], it was the site of a battle in 1245 in which [[Enzio of Sardinia]] was made prisoner.&amp;lt;br clear=left /&amp;gt; Gorgonzola received the honorary title of city with a presidential decree on June 24, 2003.

== Cheese ==
The well known [[Gorgonzola (cheese)|Gorgonzola cheese]] is claimed by the residents to have originated in Gorgonzola in 879,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www2.muw.edu/~jfitzger/page74.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; although other towns claim the origins.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0202/p11s02-lifo.html The birthplace of Gorgonzola. Maybe. | csmonitor.com&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Twin towns ==
* {{flagicon|France}} [[Ambert]], [[France]], since 2003. Both towns, known for their blue cow&amp;apos;s-milk cheeses ([[Fourme d&amp;apos;Ambert]] and [[Gorgonzola (cheese)|Gorgonzola cheese]]), have almost the same latitude: 45° 33&amp;apos; N for Ambert, 45° 32&amp;apos; N for Gorgonzola.
* {{flagicon|GER}} [[Annweiler am Trifels]], [[Germany]], since September 2008.
