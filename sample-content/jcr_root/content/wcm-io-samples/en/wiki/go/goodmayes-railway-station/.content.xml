&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Goodmayes railway station&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[railway]] station at [[Goodmayes]] in the [[London Borough of Redbridge]] in east London, opened on 18 February 1901 by the [[Great Eastern Railway]] (GER) on the [[Great Eastern Main Line|Main Line]] from [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street]]. The station once had an extensive [[Classification yard|shunting yard]] for goods traffic but this fell into disuse during [[Dr. Beeching]]&amp;apos;s modernisation (known at the time as &amp;quot;axing&amp;quot;) of the railway system in 1963, and was eventually dismantled.  The site of the yard stood on the area between the present track and the High Road and has been replaced by a [[Tesco]] Extra superstore, other stores and housing.There was also a large yard area between the existing track area and kinfauns road. This yard area went as far as chadwell heath.

It is proposed that the [[Crossrail]] line will stop here. The station is in [[Travelcard Zone 4]].
