The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Governor of the State of Kansas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the [[head of state]] for the [[Kansas|State of Kansas]], United States. Under the [[Kansas Constitution]], the Governor is also the [[head of government]], serving as the chief executive of the Kansas [[executive branch]], of the [[government of Kansas]]. The Governor is the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Kansas National Guard]] when not called into [[Federal Government of the United States|Federal]] use. Despite being an executive branch official, the Governor also possesses [[legislative branch|legislative]] and [[judicial branch|judicial]] powers. The Governor&amp;apos;s responsibilities include making yearly &amp;quot;State of the State&amp;quot; addresses to the [[Kansas Legislature]], submitting the budget, ensuring that state laws are enforced, and that the [[conservator of the peace|peace is preserved]].

The office was created in 1861 when  Kansas was officially admitted to the United States as the 34th state. Prior to statehood in 1861, the office was preceded by a [[President of the United States|Presidential]] appointed Governor of [[Kansas Territory]] with similar powers.

The 46th and current Governor of Kansas is [[Sam Brownback]]. His term began on January 11, 2011. He succeeded [[Mark Parkinson (Kansas politician)|Mark Parkinson]], who began his term on April 28, 2009 when [[Kathleen Sebelius]] resigned upon the [[US Senate]] vote confirming her as [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]].

There is no lifetime limit on the number of times he or she may be elected, but a governor who has been elected to two consecutive terms must be out of office for at least one election cycle before being eligible once again for re-election. Elections occur at the same time as the Congressional [[midterm election]]s, and each term begins on the second Monday of January following the election.  The lieutenant governor is subject to the same limitations and runs on a combined ticket with the governor.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.kslib.info/constitution/ Constitution of the State of Kansas]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

If the governor becomes incapacitated, the lieutenant governor assumes the duties of the governor.  However if both offices become vacant, the line of succession is determined by the [[Kansas Legislature|legislature]].  Under present law, the [[President of the Senate]] would be next in line to assume the governorship, followed by the [[Speaker of the House]].

==Residence==
Since 1962, the Governor of Kansas has resided in the governor&amp;apos;s mansion, known as [[Cedar Crest (mansion)|Cedar Crest]]. It was designed by the architect firm [[Wight and Wight]]. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982.
