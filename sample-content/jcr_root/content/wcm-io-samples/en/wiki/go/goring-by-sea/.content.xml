&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Goring-by-Sea&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a neighbourhood of the [[Borough]] of [[Worthing]] in [[West Sussex]], [[England]], about {{convert|2|mi}} west of [[Worthing]] town centre. Since 1929 Goring has been part of the [[Borough]] of [[Worthing]].

It is thought that the place name Goring may mean either &amp;apos;Gāra&amp;apos;s people&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;people of the wedge-shaped strip of land&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Glover, Judith 1997&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Glover, Judith (1997), Sussex Place-Names: Their Origins and Meanings Countryside Books ISBN 978-1-85306-484-5&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Usually known as &amp;quot;Goring&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;by-Sea&amp;quot; suffix has been added to differentiate it from the village of [[Goring-on-Thames]] in [[Oxfordshire]].

The [[Catholic]] church, dedicated to the English [[Martyr]]s, has a copy of the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]], painted by Gary Bevans.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.goring-by-sea.uk.com/englishmartyrs.htm THE SISTINE CHAPEL CEILING REPRODUCTION]
&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  [[St Mary&amp;apos;s Church, Goring-by-Sea|St Mary&amp;apos;s]], The [[Anglican]] [[parish church]], was originally built {{circa}} 1100 AD as the Church of Our Blessed Ladye of Gorynge and was rebuilt in 1837 by [[Decimus Burton]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.goring-by-sea.uk.com/churches.htm Churches in Goring-by-Sea]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Goring is served by [[Goring-by-Sea railway station]] and is thought to have been the inspiration for the name of the character Lord Goring in [[Oscar Wilde]]&amp;apos;s play &amp;apos;&amp;apos;An Ideal Husband&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The mixed [[pebble]] and sand beach is popular for a wide variety of [[Surface water sports|watersports]] including [[kitesurfing]], has a boat ramp, and is dog-friendly. There is a busy [[café]] at its western end.
The 1980s punk pop singer [[Billy Idol]] (William Broad) lived there for a few years.

[[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]] recorded the beach sounds for the band&amp;apos;s album [[Quadrophenia]] on Goring beach.
