The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;golden-mantled ground squirrel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Callospermophilus lateralis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a type of [[ground squirrel]] found in mountainous areas of western [[North America]].

The golden-mantled ground squirrel is abundant throughout its range and is equally at home in a wide variety of forest habitats as well as rocky [[pasture|meadows]], and even [[sagebrush]] flats.

==Description==
[[File:Callospermophilus_lateralis_Bryce_Canyon.jpg|left|thumb|Side view, Bryce Canyon]]
A typical adult ranges from {{convert|23|to(-)|30|cm|in}} in length. The golden-mantled ground squirrel can be identified by its [[chipmunk]]-like stripes and coloration, but unlike chipmunks, it lacks any facial stripes. It is commonly found living in the same habitat as [[Uinta chipmunk]]s.

The golden-mantled ground squirrel is similar to chipmunks in more than just its appearance. Although it is a traditional [[Hibernation|hibernator]], building up its body [[fat]] so to survive the winter asleep, it is also known to store some food in its burrow, like the chipmunk, for consumption upon waking in the spring. Both the golden-mantled ground squirrel and the chipmunk have cheek pouches for carrying food. Cheek pouches allow them to transport [[food]] back to their [[nest]]s and still run at full speed on all fours. Golden-mantled ground squirrels dig shallow [[burrow]]s up to {{convert|30|m|ft}} in length with the openings hidden in a hollow log or under tree roots or a boulder. The female gives birth to a single litter of 4–6 young each summer.

It eats seeds, nuts, berries, insects, and underground [[fungi]]. It is preyed upon by [[hawk]]s, [[jay]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[fox]]es, [[bobcat]]s, and [[coyote]]s.
