        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;gold gram&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the amount of value represented by exactly one [[gram]] of [[gold]]. It is a [[unit of account]] frequently used for [[digital gold currencies]]. It is sometimes denoted by the symbol &amp;quot;gg&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;AUG&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;GAU&amp;quot;.

A milligram of gold is sometimes referred to as a mil or mgg. Therefore, 1 AUG = 1 gg = 1000 mgg = 1000 mil, and 1 mil = 1 mgg = 0.001 gg = 0.001 AUG.  This allows gold holdings and transfers to take place in tiny fractions of a gram (equivalent to a few [[Cent (currency)|cents]])

A possible source of confusion is that gold is often priced on the open market in the more traditional [[troy ounce]] (one troy ounce is exactly 31.1034768 grams, which is larger than the [[avoirdupois]] ounce generally in use in the [[United States]] and has a mass of 28.35 grams). Kilogram gold prices are commonly used by the Zurich Gold Pool where 1,000 kilograms = one [[metric tonne]].
