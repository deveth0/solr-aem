&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gottfried Christian Friedrich Lücke&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (24 August 1791 – 4 February 1855) was a [[Germany|German]] [[theology|theologian]].

Luecke was born at [[Egeln]] near [[Magdeburg]], where his father was a merchant.  He studied theology at [[university of Halle|Halle]] and [[university of Göttingen|Göttingen]]. In 1814 he received the degree of doctor in philosophy from Halle; in 1816 he moved to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]], [[Berlin]], where he became licentiate in theology, and qualified as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Privatdozent]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

He soon became friendly with [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and [[Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette|de Wette]], and was associated with them in 1819 in the redaction of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theologische Zeitschrift&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Meanwhile his lectures and publications (among the latter a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grundriss der Neutestamentlichen Hermeneutik&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1816) had brought him into considerable repute, and he was appointed professor extraordinarius in the new [[University of Bonn]] in the spring of 1818; in the following autumn he became professor ordinarius. From Bonn, where he had [[Johann Christian Wilhelm Augusti|JCW Augusti]] (1772–1841), [[Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler|JKL Gieseler]], and [[Karl Immanuel Nitzsch]] for colleagues, he was called in 1827 to Göttingen to succeed [[Karl Friedrich Stäudlin|KF Staudlin]] (1761-1826). In that year he helped to found the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theologische Studien und Kritiken&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the chief organ of the &amp;quot;mediation&amp;quot; theology (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vermittelungstheologie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). At Göttingen he remained, declining all further calls elsewhere, as to Erlangen, Kiel, Halle, Tübingen, Jena and [[Leipzig]], until his death.

Luecke, who was one of the most learned, many-sided and influential of the so-called &amp;quot;mediation&amp;quot; school of evangelical theologians (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vermittelungstheologie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), is now chiefly known by his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kommentar über die Schriften d. Evangelisten Johannes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (4 vols., 1820–1832). He is an intelligent maintainer of the Johannine authorship of the Fourth Gospel; in connection with this thesis he was one of the first to argue for the early date and non-apostolic authorship of the [[Apocalypse]]. His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Einleitung in die Offenbarung Johannes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was published in 1832. He also published a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Synopsis Evangeliorum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, jointly with [[W. M. L. de Wette]] (1818).
