&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Goldfly&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an album by the rock band [[Guster]], released in 1997. The album was recorded in December 1996 at the House of Blues Studios in [[Encino, California]]. As of 2011, this album is out of print.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.districtlines.com/guster/Music&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

There are two versions of the album. The original, rare, independently-released version has the hidden song &amp;quot;Melanie&amp;quot; before the first song. The version released on Hybrid/[[Sire Records]] has the hidden song as the eleven1th track.

Due to the limited budget of the album, no B-sides were recorded besides a song called &amp;quot;Happy Birthday Ken&amp;quot; which was a gift to Ken Goldman, who had housed the band in California when they were recording.

In concert, it is a tradition for fans to throw ping-pong balls onto the stage at the end of &amp;quot;[[Airport Song]]&amp;quot;.  This is done in reference to the game of ping-pong that can be heard as the music fades at the end of the studio track.

A sample of the guitar riff and [[Bongo drum|bongo]]s from &amp;quot;Rocketship&amp;quot; can be heard in &amp;quot;Pot Of Gold&amp;quot; on the rapper [[Game (rapper)|Game]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The R.E.D. Album|R.E.D. Album]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
