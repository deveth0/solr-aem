&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ocumare del Tuy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a city located in [[Miranda State]] in northern [[Venezuela]], the [[shire town]] of the [[Lander, Venezuela|Lander Municipality]]. Ocumare del Tuy is noted for warm and clear weather, with year-round sunshine and 60 days of rainfall annually, and an average temperature that ranges from 64 to 83 °F (18 to 28 °C), but with relatively low humidity.

Ocumare del Tuy has a population of around 160,000 (2005), mainly dedicated to agriculture ([[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[coffee]], [[sugar cane]]) and livestock farming ([[pig]]s, but also [[cattle]]), with leafy forest and meadows.

Ocumare del Tuy was the capital of the state of Miranda between 1904 and 1928, when it moved to [[Petare]] and later to [[Los Teques]].
