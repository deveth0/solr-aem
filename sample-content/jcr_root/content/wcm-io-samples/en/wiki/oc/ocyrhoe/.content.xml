        text="&lt;p&gt;In [[Greek mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ocyrhoe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ocyrrhoe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang|grc|Ὠκυρρόη}}) refers to at least five characters.

*Ocyrhoe was a daughter of [[Chiron]] and [[Chariclo]]. Ocyrhoe was transformed into a horse because she told her father Chiron his exact fate. She revealed that he would forsake his immortality to be spared the agonizing pain of a serpent’s poison. For this transgression, Ocyrhoe&amp;apos;s ability to speak was taken. One might assume that she turned into a horse because her father was a centaur, and because she had long, auburn hair.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Ovid]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Metamorphoses]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 2. 636–675&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

*Ocyrrhoe, one of the [[Oceanids]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Hesiod]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Theogony]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 360&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Homeric Hymn]] to [[Demeter]], 420&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Description of Greece&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 4. 30. 4&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Mother of Phasis by [[Helios]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Pseudo-Plutarch]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;On Rivers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 5. 1&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

*Ocyrrhoe (or Ocyone), a [[nymph]]. She was the mother, by [[Hippasus (mythology)|Hippasus]], of Hippomedon (a defender of [[Troy]]), to whom she gave birth on the banks of River [[Sangarius]]. Her son was killed by [[Neoptolemus]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Fall of Troy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 11. 37&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

*Ocyrrhoe (or Ocroe), the nymph daughter of the river god Imbrasus and Chesias, a noble maiden. While in [[Miletus]] at a festival in honor of [[Artemis]], she became an object of [[Apollo]]&amp;apos;s desire and, fleeing from his advances, asked Pompilus, a seafarer and an old friend of her father, to take her home. Pompilus took her on board the ship, but Apollo caught up with them, snatched the girl and then changed the ship into stone and Pompilus into a fish.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Athenaeus]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Banquet of the Learned&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 7. 283 E (citing &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Founding of Naucratis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Apollonius Rhodius]])&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

*Ocyrrhoe, a nymph of [[Mysia]], mother of Caicus by [[Hermes]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Pseudo-Plutarch]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;On Rivers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 21. 1&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
