&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ocean Breeze&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a name sometimes applied to the southern part of the neighborhood known as [[South Beach, Staten Island|South Beach]], in [[Staten Island]], one of the five [[borough (New York City)|borough]]s of [[New York City]], [[United States]].

==History==
Once referred to as Graham Beach, the area was originally a summer beach colony consisting of many [[bungalow]]s and [[tent]]s.  Located nearby was Warren Manor, a residential development that was demolished in the 1950s to make way for a proposed new [[City University of New York|City University]] campus that ended up never being built. (In 1993 the City University system did open a new campus on Staten Island, on the grounds of the former [[Willowbrook State School]].)  A hospital was later constructed on part of the former Warren Manor property, and Staten Island Hospital was relocated to the site from [[New Brighton, Staten Island|New Brighton]] in 1979; in 1989 this hospital merged with Richmond Memorial Hospital in [[Prince&amp;apos;s Bay, Staten Island|Prince&amp;apos;s Bay]] to form Staten Island University Hospital.  Immediately to the east of [[Staten Island University Hospital]] is the [[South Beach Psychiatric Center]], a state institution for the [[mental illness|mentally ill]] which opened shortly after the aforementioned hospital did.  [[Wild Turkey]]s appeared on and near the grounds of this facility in the 1990s, and have since multiplied and spread to other Staten Island neighborhoods, having been sighted as far away as [[West New Brighton, Staten Island|West Brighton]] on the island&amp;apos;s central [[North Shore, Staten Island|North Shore]].

==Topography==
Situated in a low-lying coastal area, Ocean Breeze often experiences the worst [[flood]]-related damage in all of Staten Island after heavy rain has fallen, and many of the neighborhood&amp;apos;s side streets become impassable.

==Transportation==
Ocean Breeze is served by a number of local and express buses.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.info/nyct/maps/bussi.pdf|title=Staten Island Bus Map January 2013|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|date=January 2013|accessdate=February 18, 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
