&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Irving Rapper&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (16 January 1898 &amp;amp;ndash; 20 December 1999) was a [[UK|British]] film director. His most successful body of work is 10 films he made while under contract with [[Warner Brothers]].

Rapper emigrated to the United States and became an actor and stage director on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] while studying at [[New York University]]. In 1936, he went to [[Hollywood]], where he was hired by [[Warner Bros.]] as an assistant director and dialogue coach. He proved invaluable in translating and mediating for non-native English-speaking directors. By the early 1940s, he had metamorphosed into one of the hottest directors on the Warner Bros. lot.

He made his directing debut with the 1941 film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Shining Victory]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in which his friend [[Bette Davis]] appeared as a show of support for him. He would go on to direct her in four more films, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Now, Voyager]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1942), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Corn Is Green (1945 film)|The Corn Is Green]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1945), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Deception (1946 film)|Deception]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1946), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Another Man&amp;apos;s Poison]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1952). In later years, Rapper admitted that he found Davis very difficult to work with and that she would, &amp;quot;...hold the whole set hostage, stopping production for a day, because of her mood.&amp;quot;

Rapper&amp;apos;s film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[One Foot in Heaven]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1941) was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Film]]. Perhaps his best film in a studio other than Warner Bros. was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Brave One (1956 film)|The Brave One]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1956), which earned the then-blacklisted writer [[Dalton Trumbo]] an [[Academy Award]] for his original screenplay.

Additional credits include &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Glass Menagerie (1950 film)|The Glass Menagerie]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1950), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Marjorie Morningstar (film)|Marjorie Morningstar]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1958), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Miracle (1959 film)|The Miracle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a 1959 [[remake]] of the 1912 full-colour film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Miracle (1912 film)|The Miracle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Biopics directed by Rapper include &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Adventures of Mark Twain]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1944), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pontius Pilate&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1962) and his last film, the 1978 flop &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Born Again (film)|Born Again]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, about convicted [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] conspirator and former [[Richard Nixon]] aide [[Charles Colson]].

Rapper died at the age of 101 on 20 December 1999 at the Motion Picture and Television Fund home in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles]], where he had been a resident since 1995.
