&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Irish cream&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[cream liqueur]] based on [[Irish whiskey]], [[cream]], and other ingredients such as [[coffee]], which can be served on its own or used in [[mixed drink]]s or as part of a [[Shooter (mixed drink)|shot]] or a whole shot. Irish cream is very popular in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]].

Irish cream typically has between 15 to 20% [[alcohol by volume]] (ABV). Some notable brands of Irish cream are [[Baileys Irish Cream|Baileys]], [[Carolans]] and [[Saint Brendan&amp;apos;s]].

The five largest manufacturers of Irish Cream Liqueurs in Ireland are (in no particular order) Diageo, Niche Drinks, First Ireland Spirits, Terra, and Merry&amp;apos;s.

==Mixing==
It is usually served [[Ice cube|on the rocks]] as a moderately strong beverage on its own, but is often mixed stronger by adding more [[whiskey]] or sometimes [[bourbon whiskey|bourbon]], which complements the Irish Whiskey used in brewing. Coffee liqueur such as [[KahlÃºa]] and many caramel liqueurs are also used. Baileys is a common addition to [[White Russian (cocktail)|White Russians]], due to its creamy flavour.

==Home recipes==
Some recipes for Irish cream liqueur have been published, which use various combinations of Irish whiskey, cream, coffee (sometimes, and usually optional), sweetened [[condensed milk]] and [[evaporated milk]]. Many have significantly less alcohol by volume than the commercial brands.
