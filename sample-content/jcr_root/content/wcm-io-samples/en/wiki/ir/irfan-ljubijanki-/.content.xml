Dr. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Irfan Ljubijankić&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1952 – 28 May 1995) was a [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] facial surgeon, classical music composer, politician and diplomat. He was a good friend of [[Yusuf Islam]] ([[Cat Stevens]]).

==Biography==
Ljubijankić was born in [[Bihać]], [[Yugoslavia]], the town in which he lived for most of his life. He graduated from the [[University of Belgrade]]&amp;apos;s [[University of Belgrade School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] and became a medical doctor specializing in ear, nose and throat treatments. In 1990 as Bosnia was preparing to secede from [[Yugoslavia]], he was elected to the Bosnian parliament and became a leading member of the Bosniak-dominated [[Party of Democratic Action]]. He temporarily left politics in 1992 after the beginning of the civil war between the [[Bosniaks]] and the [[Bosnian Serb]]s, in order to serve as a medical doctor in Bihać.

Ljubijankić remained an active medical doctor until October 1993 when he became [[foreign minister]] of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He traveled widely to help gain international support for the country. Shortly before his death, he represented Bosnia-Herzegovina at the 50th anniversary celebration of the end of [[World War II]] in [[London]] on 1 May 1995. He was killed when his helicopter was shot down by a missile over [[Cetingrad]], [[Croatia]], a town near the Bosnian border which was being held by Krajina Serbs at that time. He was flying from Bihać to [[Zagreb]], Croatia&amp;apos;s capital, on government business, and the six other people on the helicopter also died. Ljubijankić was married and had two children.
