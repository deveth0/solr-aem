&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ira Jones&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (July 10, 1923 â€“ July 11, 2004) was an author, best known as the first sergeant in charge of [[Elvis Presley]] for a portion of the time Elvis served in the army.  Elvis drove Jones&amp;apos; [[jeep]] for nine months while the two were stationed together in [[Germany]]. Jones was also a veteran of [[World War II]] and a recipient of both the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze]] and [[Silver Star]]s.

The two first met in the port city of [[Bremerhaven]], Germany, in the autumn of 1958 when Elvis was among the replacement troops arriving aboard the USS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;General Randall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Elvis drove Jones in a jeep named &amp;quot;HQ 31&amp;quot; for nine months while serving in the Scout Platoon, [[1st Medium Tank Battalion]], 32nd Armor, of the [[U.S. 3rd Armored Division|3rd Armored Division]], part of the [[U.S. Seventh Army]].  Although Jones had no idea what Elvis looked like before they met, it has been reported that the two formed a close bond during their time together. [http://www.elvisinfonet.com/irajones.html 1]

On May 6, 1959, Sgt Jones appeared on the popular television game show &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[I&amp;apos;ve Got A Secret]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In the years that followed, Jones became a regular speaker at Elvis-related conventions, Bill E. Burk&amp;apos;s [[Elvis World]] breakfasts and fan club meetings all over the world including in Germany.

Jones appeared in numerous television specials, documentaries and videos including the short-lived newsmagazine &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Instant Recall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, hosted by [[John Palmer (TV journalist)|John Palmer]], former news anchor from NBC&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the 2001 documentary &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Remembering Elvis: A Documentary]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0791191/], which also included interviews with comedian [[Steve Allen]] and others.
