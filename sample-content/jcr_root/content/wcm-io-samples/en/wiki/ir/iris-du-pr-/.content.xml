&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Iris du Pré&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (née &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Iris Greep&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (June 6, 1914 – September 27, 1985) was a [[pianist]], [[composer]], conductor and educator, best known as the mother of two famous musicians, [[Hilary du Pré|Hilary]], and [[Jacqueline du Pré|Jacqueline]].

Iris married [[Derek du Pré]], an accountant whom she met by chance when he was traveling in eastern Europe.  She was already a professional musician, her own compositions including part of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ballet de la Jeunesse Anglaise&amp;apos;&amp;apos; performed in 1941.  In 1942 their first daughter, [[Hilary du Pré|Hilary]], was born, and in 1945 they had a second daughter, Jacqueline. Their son, Piers, was born in 1948.

As a music teacher, Iris started the education of her two daughters on the [[flute]] and [[cello]], in addition to teaching in the public sector at [[Apsley Grammar School]] in [[Hemel Hempstead]] during the 1970s.  In the film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hilary and Jackie]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Iris is played by [[Celia Imrie]].
