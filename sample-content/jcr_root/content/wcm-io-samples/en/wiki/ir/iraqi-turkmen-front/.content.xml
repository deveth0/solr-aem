The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Iraqi Turkmen Front&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-tr|Irak Türkmen Cephesi}}, {{lang-ar|الجبهة التركمانية العراقي}} &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Al-Jabhat Al-Turkmaniyah Al-Iraqi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a political movement founded in 1995 which seeks to represent the [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen people]] of [[Iraq]]. Since the fall of [[Saddam Hussein]] in 2003, the ITF has contested control of [[Kirkuk]] and other areas of northern Iraq.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifpo.revues.org/1115|title=The Iraqi Turkmen Front|author=Raber Tal’at Jawhar|accessdate=February 26, 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The ITF claims a region named Turkmeneli (literally meaning the &amp;quot;land of the Turkmens&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Anderson &amp;amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=57&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=57}}.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) as the homeland by the Iraqi Turkmens. Turkmeneli includes within its boundaries [[Kirkuk]], [[Tel Afar]], [[Erbil]], [[Mandali, Iraq|Mandali]], [[Mosul]], and [[Tuz Khormato]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=16}}.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Anderson &amp;amp; Stansfield 2009 loc=57&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==ITF Composition==
The ITF is a coalition of the following political parties:
*Iraqi National Turkmen Party (INTP), founded in 1988 and operated in the northern [[Iraqi no-fly zones]]
*Turkmeneli Party, founded in 1992 in [[Northern Cyprus]] as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Turkmen Union Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
*Provincial Turkmen Party
*Movement of the Independent Turkmen
*Iraqi Turkmen Rights Party
*Turkmen Islamic Movement of Iraq

==Election results==
In the [[Iraqi legislative election, December 2005]], the ITF list (#630) polled 76,434 votes, or 0.7% nationwide, according to the uncertified published results. The overwhelming majority of those votes were cast in [[At-Ta&amp;apos;mim Governorate|Kirkuk Province]], where the ITF won more than 10% of the total. Most of the rest of the ITF&amp;apos;s votes were in [[Salah ad Din Governorate|Salah ad Din]] province. According to the full official results of that election, the ITF is entitled to only one seat in the permanent [[National Assembly of Iraq|National Assembly]]. The party has been funded deeply by the Turkish administration and military.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Raber Tal’at Jawhar. &amp;quot;The Iraqi Turkmen Front&amp;quot;. Retrieved February 26, 2012.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the aftermath of the first [[Iraqi legislative election, January 2005|Iraqi parliamentary election in 2005]], the ITF lodged a number of formal complaints to the [[Independent High Electoral Commission|Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq]] alleging vote fraud on the part of the [[Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan|Kurdish parties]] and protesting the Commission&amp;apos;s decision to allow Kurdish [[internally displaced person]]s and [[refugee]]s to vote in the places from which they had been expelled under Saddam Hussein. In the election, they received just over 90,000 votes, or 1.1% of votes cast, earning them three seats in the trasitional National Assembly of Iraq.

In the 2009 Iraqi Kurdistan legislative election, the ITF polled just 7,077 votes, or 0.38% of the popular vote, winning 1 seat.

In the 2010 Iraqi national elections, the ITF candidate in the Turkmen stronghold of [[Kirkuk]], [[Arshad al-Salihi]], won 59,732 votes as a part of [[Iyad Allawi]]&amp;apos;s [[Iraqi National Movement|Iraqiya List]]. This was second only to [[Khalid Shwani]] of the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]], who won 68,522 votes. This is a very high figure, since the Turkmens historically made up roughly 10-20% of the population and as such, much of the support for the Turkmen candidate must have been gained from the Arab supporters.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
