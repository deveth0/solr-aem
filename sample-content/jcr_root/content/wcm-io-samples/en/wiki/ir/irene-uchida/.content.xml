&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Irene Ayako Uchida&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} (born April 8, 1917) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] scientist and [[Down syndrome]] researcher.

Born in [[Vancouver]], she initially studied [[English literature]] at the [[University of British Columbia]]. As a child and teenager she played violin and piano, and was described as &amp;quot;out-going&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;social&amp;quot; She went to visit her mother and sister who were in [[Japan]] at the time, and was able to catch a ship out of Japan prior to the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] on December 1941.

In 1944 she continued her studies at the [[University of Toronto]] where she wanted to get a masters degree in [[social work]]. Her professors encouraged her to pursue a career in [[genetics]], and as a result she completed PhD in human genetics at the University of Toronto in 1951 and worked at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. At the Hospital for Sick Children she studied [[twin]]s and children with [[Down syndrome]]. In the 1960s she helped identify the link between [[x-ray]]s and [[birth defects]] in pregnant women.

In 1960 she became the director of the Department of Medical Genetics at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]] and became a professor at the University of Manitoba (National Library of Canada and National Archives of Canada, 1997).

In 1993, she was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] for &amp;quot;her research on radiation and human chromosome abnormalities [that] has made a notable contribution to medical science&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{OCC|3187}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
