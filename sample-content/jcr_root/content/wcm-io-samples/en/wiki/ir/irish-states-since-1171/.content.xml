        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Irish states&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; have existed under a number of different names for nearly a thousand years. A unified Irish proto-state had been coalescing from the multitude of small tribal kingdoms that existed circa AD 500, similar to the pattern elsewhere in [[Europe]]. The development of the several dynastic regional kingdoms into a nascent national kingdom, however, was extinguished by the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169.

This list deals with the various states that existed from 1171 onwards that owed their origin to [[Normans|Norman]] and later, [[England|English]] involvement on the island of [[Ireland]]. These were recognised by the [[Holy See]] before 1570 and after 1766. Until the whole island was subdued following the end of the [[Nine Years&amp;apos; War (Ireland)|Nine Years&amp;apos; War]] in 1603 these states shared the island of Ireland with a patchwork of indigenous states that existed outside of their authority.

The list below refers to all-Ireland (or nominally all-Ireland) states and to the post-partition states, not the patchwork of small Gaelic kingdoms.

* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Lordship of Ireland]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1171–1541)
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Kingdom of Ireland]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1541–1800)
:* [[Confederate Ireland]] was an Irish government that controlled much of Ireland between during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]].
* Part of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1801–1922)
* The revolutionary &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Irish Republic]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1919–22)
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Northern Ireland]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1921–present) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Southern Ireland]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1921–22), both created by the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]], though only the former existed in reality.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Irish Free State|Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann)]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1922–37)
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1937–present), often known since 1949 by its official description, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Republic of Ireland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and sometimes in [[English language|English]] as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Éire]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the word for Ireland in [[Irish language|Irish]].

For international purposes the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] was also [[Monarchy of Ireland|King of Ireland]] until 1949, but from 1937 his internal powers in Ireland had been transferred to the [[President of Ireland]]. With the enactment of the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|Republic of Ireland Act]] in 1949, all powers of the British monarch were transferred to the president. The name of the state remained &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ireland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, even after the passing of the Republic of Ireland Act, see [[names of the Irish state]].
