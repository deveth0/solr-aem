        text="&lt;p&gt;[[File:Modigliani - Female nude (Iris Tree).jpg|thumb|Iris Tree by [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]], c. 1916]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Iris Tree&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (27 January 1897 â€“ 13 April 1968) was an English poet, actress and artists&amp;apos; model, described as a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]], an [[eccentricity (behaviour)|eccentric]], a [[wit]] and an adventuress.

Her parents were actors Sir [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] and [[Helen Maud Tree]], and her sisters were actresses [[Felicity Tree|Felicity]] and [[Viola Tree]]. An aunt was author [[Constance Beerbohm]], and her uncles were explorer and author [[Julius Beerbohm]] and [[Caricature|caricaturist]] and [[Parody|parodist]] [[Max Beerbohm]].

Iris Tree was sought after, as a young woman, as an artists&amp;apos; model, being painted by [[Augustus John]], simultaneously by [[Duncan Grant]], [[Vanessa Bell]] and [[Roger Fry]], and sculpted by [[Jacob Epstein]], showing her bobbed hair (she was said to have cut off the rest and left it on a train) that, along with other behaviour, caused much scandal. The sculpture is currently displayed at the [[Tate]] Britain. She was photographed countless times by [[Man Ray]], and ran with [[Nancy Cunard]] for a time, in a set at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant of Rudolph Stulik; and acted alongside [[Diana Cooper]] in the mid-1920s.

She had studied at the [[Slade School of Art]]. She contributed verse to the 1917 [[The Sitwells|Sitwell]] [[anthology]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wheels&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; her published collections were &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Poems&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1920) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Traveller and other Poems&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1927).

She married twice. Her first marriage was to [[Curtis Moffat]], a New York artist; [[Ivan Moffat]], the [[screenwriter]], was their son. Her second marriage was to the actor and ex-officer of the [[Austria]]n cavalry, Count [[Count Friedrich von Ledebur|Friedrich von Ledebur-Wicheln]]. They both appear (after their divorce) in the [[Moby Dick (1956 film)|1956 film version]] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Moby-Dick]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. She also appears in a cameo, essentially as herself, in [[Federico Fellini]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[La Dolce Vita]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
