        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Irving Joshua Matrix&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; — born ([[Japan]], 1908) as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Irving Joshua Bush&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and commonly known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dr.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;I. J.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Matrix&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; — was a fictitious [[polymath]] scientist, scholar, and entrepreneur who made extraordinary contributions to [[perpetual motion]] engineering, [[Bible code|Biblical cryptography]] and [[numerology]],  [[pyramid power]], [[pentagon|pentagonal]] [[meditation]], [[extra-sensory perception]], [[spoon bending|psychic metallurgy]], and a number of other topics.  He was an accomplished [[Magic (illusion)|prestidigitator]] and an intuitive [[mathematician]], two qualities which he put to good use in most of his enterprises. Being a fictitious character he could perform tasks that were logically impossible; for example, he could &amp;quot;clap one hand in the air&amp;quot; when summoning a waiter or a minion.

Dr. Matrix was the satirical creation of [[popular mathematics]] columnist [[Martin Gardner]] (1914-2010), who reported some of his doings in his &amp;quot;[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]&amp;quot; column in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Scientific American]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; beginning in 1959. The intent was partly to provide colorful context to mathematical puzzles and curiosities, partly as a spoof of various [[pseudo-scientific]] theories, and always to provide a humorous introduction to the serious topic at hand.

==Fictitious biography==
Matrix was born in [[Japan]], the eldest of  seven children of the Reverend William Miller Bush, a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] [[missionary]].  He resided in Japan until the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], where he learned the secrets of the conjuring art and worked as assistant to the famous Japanese magician [[Tenkai]].

Presumably it was in Japan that he met Ms. [[Eisei Toshiyori]], and where their daughter [[Iva Matrix]] was born. Iva accompanied Dr. Matrix through most of his public life, acting as assistant and manager in most of his enterprises.  The author of the fictitious narrative pretended to be romantically interested in Iva, thus explaining his continuing interest in Dr. Matrix&amp;apos;s activities.

He was a close friend and a student of [[Nicholas Bourbaki]].

Dr. Matrix was often persecuted by establishment authorities, and many times had to change abode and live under assumed names, with appropriate matching changed appearances. He was accused several times of fraud. He reportedly died in a duel against a certain [[Ivan Skavinsky Skavar]], in circumstances as obscure and dubious as most of his career.
