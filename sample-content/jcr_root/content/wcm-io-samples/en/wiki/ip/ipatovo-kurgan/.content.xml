        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ipatovo kurgan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refers to kurgan 2 of the Ipatovo Barrow Cemetery 3, a cemetery of [[kurgan]] burial mounds, located near [[Ipatovo]], some 120 km north-east of [[Stavropol]], [[Stavropol Krai]], [[Russia]].

With a height of 7 metres, it was one of the largest kurgans in the area. It was completely investigated in 1998&amp;amp;ndash;1999, revealing thirteen phases of construction and use, from the [[4th millennium BC]] to the 18th century AD.

The first grave may have been a burial of the [[Maykop culture]], which was destroyed by later graves. The earliest extant grave contained two young people, buried in a sitting position, dating to the late 4th millennium.

On top of the kurgan was a [[Sarmatian]] grave of the 3rd century BC. A woman had been buried here in extended position on the back, together with an exceptionally rich treasure of [[grave goods|grave-goods]]: six solid golden necklets, two golden spiral bracelets, two golden finger rings made from [[Hellenistic]] coins, a gilded wooden cup decorated with [[zoomorphic]] figures, a short sword with gold-decorated pommel (the presence of a weapon in a woman&amp;apos;s grave is not an unusual feature in Sarmatian contexts) and a gold-covered scabbard, a sheet gold buckle, a gilded wooden [[cosmetic container (vessel)|cosmetics container]], and clay vessels.

In the final phase, more than 100 simple graves were dug into the southern slope of the barrow &amp;amp;ndash; probably 18th century burials of the nomadic [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Nogais|Nogai]] people.
