&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Platon Leonidovich Lebedev&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Russian: Плато́н Леони́дович Ле́бедев; born 29 November 1956) is a former CEO of [[Group Menatep]], currently imprisoned in Russia, and is best known as a close associate of [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/russian-court-denies-lebedev-his-freedom-560172.html|title= Russian court denies Lebedev his freedom|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=16 February 2010 | location=London | date=16 April 2004 | first=Our | last=City}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Conviction==
Lebedev was convicted of [[tax evasion]] in 2005, and sentenced to nine years in prison.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4482203.stm|title=Khodorkovsky: an oligarch undone |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 February 2010 | date=31 May 2005 | first=Jeremy | last=Scott-Joynt}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was subsequently charged with [[embezzlement]] and [[money laundering]] in 2009, and pled not guilty to the charges.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bbc09&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8009817.stm|title=Ex-Yukos chief pleads not guilty |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 February 2010 | date=21 April 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/8465300|title=Khodorkovsky pleads not guilty to embezzlement|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=16 February 2010 | location=London | date=23 January 2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; There has been speculation that these charges were politically motivated.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/03/international/europe/03CND-RUSS.html?ex=1057896000&amp;amp;en=c31af43ea395412e&amp;amp;ei=5062&amp;amp;partner=GOOGLE|title=Oil Executive Is Arrested, and Russians Look for Putin&amp;apos;s Role|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=16 February 2010 | first=Sabrina | last=Tavernise | date=3 July 2003}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; On December 27, 2010, Lebedev and [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]] were sentenced again, and will likely spend several more years in jail. &amp;quot;A short prison sentence might be considered a victory for Mr. Putin’s protégé, President Dmitri A. Medvedev, a former law professor who is thought of as less of a hard-liner. Mr. Medvedev has been promoting policies to modernize Russia, and analysts say the Khodorkovsky case is an obstacle toward convincing foreign investors that the country’s legal system is fair.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;CLIFFORD J. LEVY and ANDREW E. KRAMER, &amp;apos;Imprisoned Russian Oil Tycoon Is Convicted Again&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[New York Times]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, DECEMBER 27, 2010 [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/world/europe/28russia.html?_r=1&amp;amp;hp]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Tom Parfitt, &amp;apos;WikiLeaks: rule of law in Mikhail Khodorkovsky trial merely gloss&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Guardian.co.uk]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, DECEMBER 27, 2010 [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/27/wikileaks-russia-mikhail-khodorkovsky-trial]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On 24 May 2011, Lebedev and Khodorkovsky were named [[prisoners of conscience]] by [[Amnesty International]], which criticized the men&amp;apos;s second trial and called for their release on the expiry of their initial sentences.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;AI&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/russian-businessmen-declared-prisoners-conscience-after-convictions-are-upheld-2011 |title=Russian businessmen declared prisoners of conscience after convictions are upheld |author= |date=24 May 2011 |work= |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=24 May 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On 7 August 2012, Lebedev&amp;apos;s 13-year sentence was reduced by 3 years and 4 months by a district court judge in the Arkhangelsk region city of Velsk, where Lebedev is imprisoned.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/russia-reduces-prison-term-for-lebedev-interfax-says-correct-.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=8 August 2012|title=Russian Court Orders Release Of Khodorkovsky Partner In 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This action came as a result of the prosecutor&amp;apos;s office requesting a re-qualification of Lebedev&amp;apos;s offenses due to the passage of a new legal statute in the Russian Criminal Code which reduced the punishment for offenses of which he had been convicted.
