&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Planters&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[United States|American]] snack food company, a division of [[Kraft Foods]], best known for its processed [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s and for the [[Mr. Peanut]] icon that symbolizes them.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;History&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Planter&amp;apos;s History of the Planter Nut|url=http://www.planters.com/history.aspx|accessdate=December 2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Mr. Peanut was created by grade schooler Antonio Gentile for a 1916 contest to design the company&amp;apos;s brand icon.&amp;lt;ref name=History /&amp;gt;  His design was perfected by a commercial artist and has changed over the years.

==History==

[[File:Planters nuts advert in Saturday Evening Post 1921-06-11.png|thumb|Planters Nut &amp;amp; Chocolate Company advertisement in the [[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]], 1921.]]

Planters was founded by [[Italian people|Italian]] [[immigrant]] [[Amedeo Obici]] in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]]. He started his career as a bellhop and fruit stand vendor in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. Obici later moved to Wilkes-Barre, opened his own fruit stand, and invested in a peanut roaster. Obici turned peddler within a few years, using a horse and wagon, and calling himself &amp;quot;The Peanut Specialist&amp;quot;. In 1906, Obici entered a partnership with Mario Peruzzi. Peruzzi had developed his own method of blanching whole roasted peanuts, doing away with the troublesome hulls and skins; and so with six employees, two large roasters, and crude machinery, Planters was founded. Amedeo Obici believed that prices and first profits were as important as repeat business, focusing his operation on quality and brand name for continued success. Two years later, the firm was incorporated as Planters Nut and Chocolate Company.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/plantnuts.htm History of Planters Peanuts]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  It was acquired by [[Standard Brands]] in 1960. In 1981, Standard Brands merged with [[Nabisco|Nabisco Brands]], which was acquired by [[Kraft Foods]] in 2000.

==International==

While used under license from Kraft Canada, Planters in Canada is actually made by JVF Canada.  Some Planters items, such as the cookies under the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;100 Calorie packs&amp;apos;&amp;apos; line from Nabisco, do not use the Planters name, but are under &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kraft Peanut Butter&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in Canada.  Corn Nuts, though, are owned by Kraft Canada.
