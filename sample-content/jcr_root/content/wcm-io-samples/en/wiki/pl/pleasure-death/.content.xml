__NOTOC__

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pleasure Death&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the second (mini-)album by the band [[Therapy?]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.therapyquestionmark.co.uk/discography/albums/pleasuredeath.php | title=Official Discography}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was released on 27 January 1992 on [[Wiiija Records]]. The album was recorded in 1991 at [[Southern Studios]], [[London]]. It reached number 1 in the UK Indie Charts.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.therapyquestionmark.co.uk/biography/band/#a_1992 | title=Band Biography (1992) by Andy Cairns}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The album was originally released by Wiiija on 12” vinyl. In 1993, [[Southern Records]] re-issued the album on 12” vinyl, CD and Cassette.

The album was remastered in 2010 by Harvey Birrell and has been touted for possible release since then, although nothing has been confirmed as yet.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.drop-d.ie/interview-therapy/11256 | title= drop-d Interview}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Trivia==
* The sample in &amp;quot;Skinning Pit&amp;quot; (“Every once in a while I&amp;apos;d have to take a beating. But by then, I didn’t care. The way I saw it, everybody takes a beating sometime”) is taken from the 1990 movie &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Goodfellas]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and is spoken by actor [[Ray Liotta]].
* The sample in &amp;quot;Potato Junkie&amp;quot; (“Don’t you ever feel attracted to the girls you photograph…”) is often cited as having come from the 1978 movie &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pretty Baby (film)|Pretty Baby]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, being spoken by actress [[Brooke Shields]] and actor [[Keith Carradine]].  The British accents in the sample, however, make this impossible.
