&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Platanus racemosa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a species of [[Platanus|sycamore tree]] known by several common names, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;California sycamore&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Western sycamore&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;California plane tree&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and in Spanish &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aliso&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It is native to [[California]] and [[Baja California]], where it grows in [[riparian]] areas, [[canyon]]s, [[floodplain]]s, at [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] and [[Seep (hydrology)|seeps]], and along [[stream]]s and [[river]]s in several types of [[habitat]]s.

==Description==
This large tree grows to 35 meters in height with a trunk diameter of up to one meter. A specimen on the campus of [[Stanford University]] has a trunk diameter of 10.5 feet.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://trees.stanford.edu/ENCYC/PLATrac.htm Stanford Trees, Shrubs, and Vines]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The trunk generally divides into two or more large trunks splitting into many branches. The bark is an attractive patchwork of white, tawny beige, pinkish gray, and pale brown, with older bark becoming darker and peeling away.

The large [[Leaf shape|palmately lobed]] [[leaves]] may be up to 25 centimeters wide and have three or five pointed lobes. New leaves are a bright translucent green and somewhat woolly. The [[deciduous]] tree drops copious amounts of dry golden to orangish red leaves in the fall. The [[inflorescence]] is made up of a few spherical flower heads each around a centimeter wide. The female flower heads develop into spherical fruit clusters each made up of many hairy, maroon-red-woolly [[achene]]s. The dangling seed balls are attractive on the tree.

The tough and coarse-grained wood is difficult to split and work. It has various uses, including acting as a meat preparation block for [[butchers]]. Many small birds feed on its fruit, and several mammals eat its twigs and bark. The [[pollen]] and the hairs on leaves and flowers can be [[allergen]]s for some people.&amp;lt;ref name=cal&amp;gt;[http://www.californiagardens.com/Plant_Pages/platanus_racemosa.htm Californiagardens.com]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; New leaves are susceptible to [[Canker|anthracnose canker]], which, when it causes a side bud to become the new leader, can create picturesque angling trunks and branches on older specimens.&amp;lt;ref name=cal/&amp;gt;

==Cultivation==
It is also widely planted horticulturally as a [[ornamental plant|landscape tree]] in public landscapes and private gardens. New appreciation for how it shades sun in summer and lets sun through in winter has led to its use in [[green architecture]] and [[sustainable design]]. The aesthetics of its bark and its overall form add interest.
