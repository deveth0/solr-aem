The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ZX Interface 2&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[peripheral]] from [[Sinclair Research Ltd|Sinclair Research]] for its [[ZX Spectrum]] [[home computer]] released in September 1983.  It had two [[joystick]] ports and a [[ROM cartridge]] slot, which offered instant loading times. The joystick ports were not compatible with the popular [[Kempston Micro Electronics|Kempston interface]], and thus did not work with most Spectrum games released prior to the launch of the ZX Interface 2. In addition, the pass-through expansion bus provided was stripped, only allowing a [[ZX Printer]] to be attached.

== Compatible titles ==

Availability of cartridge software was very limited:  The cost was almost twice as much as the same game on [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]], and each cartridge could only hold 16 [[Kibibyte|KiB]], making it almost immediately obsolete as the majority of Spectrums sold were 48K-models, which the software publishers targeted.

Only ten games were commercially released:

# [[Jetpac]]
# [[PSSST]]
# [[Cookie (game)|Cookie]]
# [[Tranz Am]]
# Chess
# Backgammon
# [[Horace series|Hungry Horace]]
# [[Horace series|Horace and the Spiders]]
# Planetoids
# Space Raiders

Paul Farrow has demonstrated that it is possible to produce custom ROM cartridges, including the ability to exceed the 16 [[Kibibyte|KiB]] design limitation of the ROM cartridges.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Farrow |url=http://www.fruitcake.plus.com/Sinclair/Interface2/Cartridges/Interface2_RC_Custom.htm |title=ZX Interface 2 - Custom ROM Cartridges |publisher=Fruitcake.plus.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-15}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Joystick ports==

The interface two came with two joystick ports that (unlike the [[Kempston interface|Kempston]] which used the IN31 command) were mapped to actual key presses.  Player 1 was mapped to 1-5 and player 2 was mapped to 6-0.  This initially seemed at odds with Sinclair&amp;apos;s own keyboard layout, given that the keyboard itself had the cursor keys mapped to 5-8 with 0 typically being used by games as a fire button. Joystick interfaces that mapped to the cursor keys were available, but like the popular Kempston interface they were limited to supporting a single joystick only. It was the twin joystick feature of the ZX Interface 2 that turned out to be its major selling point.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.crashonline.org.uk/03/sinclair.htm &amp;quot;Sinclair talks...&amp;quot;, CRASH magazine, Issue 3, April 1984]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
