The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ngonye Falls&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.zambiatourism.com/travel/places/ngonye.htm NGONYE FALLS - Zambia Tourism]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/413559/Ngonye-Falls Ngonye Falls -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sioma Falls&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are a [[waterfall]] on the [[Zambezi]] river in Western [[Zambia]], near the town of [[Sioma]] and a few hundred kilometers upstream from the [[Victoria Falls]].  Situated in the southern part of [[Barotseland]], the falls are a difficult two or three day journey from the capital, [[Lusaka]].  Their inaccessibility makes them much less known than Victoria Falls.

The falls are formed by the same geological process as Victoria Falls, with cracks in the [[basalt]] riverbed being [[erosion|eroded]] away to form the drop.  Their height is only 10-25 meters, but the width of the falls is impressive.  They form a broad crescent, interrupted by rocky outcrops.

Upstream from the falls, the river is broad and shallow as it flows across [[Kalahari]] sands, but below the falls extensive [[white water rapids]] exist, as the river is hemmed in by [[gorge]]s cut into basalt rock.

The surrounding area supports extensive [[wildlife]], especially in the nearby [[Sioma Ngwezi National Park]], and [[elephant]]s are frequently seen by the river in the vicinity of the falls.
