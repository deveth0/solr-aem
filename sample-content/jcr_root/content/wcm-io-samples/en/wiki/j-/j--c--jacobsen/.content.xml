&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jacob Christian Jacobsen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2 September 1811 – 30 April 1887), mostly known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;J. C. Jacobsen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[industrialist]] and [[philanthropist]] best known for founding the brewery [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]].

He had no formal academic or scientific training (although he had attended some lectures by [[Hans Christian Ørsted]]). In the 1840s he had come to realise that production of [[beer]], which had until then been done in numerous small [[brewery|breweries]], now had to be based on scientific methods and to be industrialised.

Starting in 1844, he established his brewery Carlsberg (named after his son, [[Carl Jacobsen]]), in [[Valby]] on the outskirts of [[Copenhagen]], on a site where it has remained since. Being extremely scrupulous as for the securing of high quality beer, in 1875 he founded the [[Carlsberg Laboratory]].

He took much interest in public affairs and supported the [[National Liberal Party (Denmark)|National Liberal Party]] – being gradually more of a conservative – both as an MP for some periods between 1854 and 1871 and as a strong supporter of the case of defence. Besides he was a well-known patron of art. After the fire of [[Frederiksborg Palace]] in 1859 he paid its rebuilding.

1876 he also founded “Carlsberg-fondet” - the [[Carlsberg Foundation]] that became his heir because of family problems of the next years. A bitter conflict with his son Carl led to the latter&amp;apos;s foundation of the Ny Carlsberg (New Carlsberg) Brewery 1882. A reconciliation was however obtained 1886. This conflict was the theme of a debated Danish TV drama series aired in 1997.

His son [[Carl Jacobsen]] created one of the largest private art collections of his time. It is now housed in the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]], a museum founded by him in Copenhagen.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glyptoteket.dk/aba16797-8ba2-485d-81e3-b77f148de1da.W5Doc?frames=yes|title=Link from Glyptoteket.dk site about the collection.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
