&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Júlio Prestes de Albuquerque&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (March 15, 1882 &amp;amp;ndash; February 9, 1946) was a Brazilian politician. Governor of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo state]] in 1926, he was elected [[president of Brazil]] on March 1, 1930, but never took office because the government was overthrown in the [[Revolution of 1930]] that brought [[Getúlio Vargas]] to power, three weeks before Prestes&amp;apos; scheduled inauguration on November 15, 1930.
