&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;J. C. Heard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; a.k.a. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;James Charles Heard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (August 10, 1917 in [[Dayton, Ohio]] – September 27, 1988 in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]]) was a [[United States]] [[swing music|swing]], [[bebop|bop]], and [[blues]] [[drummer]].

Heard was a very supportive drummer, versatile enough to fit comfortably into swing, bop and blues settings. He obtained his first important professional job with [[Teddy Wilson]] in 1939 and continued performing into the 1980s. He performed with [[Lena Horne]], [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Benny Carter]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Erroll Garner]], [[Jazz at the Philharmonic]], [[Pete Johnson]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Sir Charles Thompson]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Roy Eldridge]] besides leading his own groups.

In 1946–47, he recorded with top bop musicians, led his own band at Cafe Society, was a member of Erroll Garner&amp;apos;s trio, and toured with [[Jazz at the Philharmonic]]. In the years 1953 through 1957, he spent time in Japan as a singer/entertainer, mentoring young Japanese singers and musicians like [[Yukimura Izumi]], George Kawaguchi and Franky Sakai. During 1957–66 he freelanced in New York (playing with the Coleman Hawkins-Roy Eldridge Quintet and with Teddy Wilson&amp;apos;s trio in 1961). In 1966 J.C. Heard moved to Detroit where he worked as a bandleader and a mentor to younger musicians into the mid-&amp;apos;80s. &amp;lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:J.C._Heard_Trio.jpg|thumb|right|J.C. with his trio in Drayton Plains, MI., circa 1969.]]  --&amp;gt;
