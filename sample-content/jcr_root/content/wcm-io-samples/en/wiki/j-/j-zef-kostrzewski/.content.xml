&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Józef Kostrzewski&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 25, 1885 &amp;amp;ndash; October 19, 1969) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[archaeology|archaeologist]].

Kostrzewski was born in [[Węglewo, Poznań County|Węglewo]] (now in [[Poznań County]]). He studied first in [[Kraków]], then from 1910 onwards with [[Gustaf Kossinna]] at [[Berlin]] and graduated in 1914. Back in Poland, he was to turn Kossinna&amp;apos;s settlement-archaeological method (&amp;quot;[[siedlungsarchäologische Methode]]&amp;quot;) against its creator and to try to prove a [[Slavic peoples|Slavonic]] [[Slavic peoples#Autochthonic|autochthonism]] in Poland from at least the [[Bronze Age]] ([[Lusatian culture]]) onwards.

Kostrzewski became professor of prehistory at the newly founded [[University of Poznań]] in 1919, and from 1934 conducted the excavation of the [[Iron Age]] settlement of [[Biskupin]], which he continued after the war.

After 1918, Kostrzewski became involved in bitter polemics about the ethnic ascription of the [[Lusatian culture|Lusatian]] and [[Pomeranian culture]]s with the German archaeologist [[Bolko von Richthofen]].

During the German occupation of Poland during [[World War II]], Polish universities and museums were closed, the finds were often transported to Germany, and many scholars were arrested, tortured and detained, or murdered.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Kostrzewski hid from the [[Gestapo]] during the war, but returned to his Poznań chair in 1945. He died in Poznań.
