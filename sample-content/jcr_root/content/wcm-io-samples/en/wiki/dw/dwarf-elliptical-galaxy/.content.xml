        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dwarf elliptical galaxies&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or dEs, are [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] that are much smaller than others. They are classified as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;dE&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and are quite common in galaxy groups and clusters, and are usually companions to other galaxies.

== Examples ==
One of the most nearby &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dwarf ellipticals&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;dE&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s) is [[Messier 32|M32]], a satellite of the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]. In 1944 [[Walter Baade]] confirmed dwarf ellipticals [[NGC 147]] and [[NGC 185]] as members of the [[Local Group]] by resolving them into individual stars. Resolving stars in [[NGC 147]] and [[NGC 185]] was only possible because these dEs are very nearby galaxies. In the 1950s, dEs were also discovered in the nearby Fornax and Virgo clusters.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;G. Reaves (1956), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1956AJ.....61...69R Dwarf galaxies in the Virgo cluster]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Comparison with giant ellipticals ==
Dwarf elliptical galaxies have blue [[absolute magnitude]]s within the range -18 mag &amp;lt; M &amp;lt; -14 mag, fainter than giant elliptical galaxies. While the surface brightness profiles of [[elliptical galaxy|giant elliptical galaxies]] are well described by [[de Vaucouleur&amp;apos;s law]], dEs have exponentially declining surface brightness profiles. However, both types can be well fit by the same more general law, [[Sersic&amp;apos;s law]], and there is a continuity of Sersic index as a function of luminosity,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;A. Graham and R. Guzman (2003), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AJ....125.2936G HST Photometry of Dwarf Elliptical Galaxies in Coma, and an Explanation for the Alleged Structural Dichotomy between Dwarf and Bright Elliptical Galaxies]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; suggesting that dwarf and giant elliptical galaxies belong to a single sequence. Still fainter elliptical-like galaxies, called [[dwarf spheroidal galaxies]], appear to be genuinely distinct.

== Two hypotheses for origins ==
Dwarf ellipticals may be primordial objects. Within the currently favoured cosmological [[Lambda-CDM model]], small objects (consisting of dark matter and gas) are the first to form. Because of their mutual gravitational attraction, some of these will coalesce and merge, forming more massive objects. Further mergers lead to ever more massive objects.

The process of coalescence is thought to lead to the present-day galaxies, and has been called &amp;quot;hierarchical merging&amp;quot;. If this hypothesis is correct, dwarf galaxies may be the building blocks of today&amp;apos;s giant galaxies.

An alternative suggestion&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Moore, B. et al. (1996), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996Natur.379..613M Galaxy harassment and the evolution of clusters of galaxies]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; is that dEs could be the remnants of low-mass spiral galaxies that obtained a rounder shape through the action of repeated gravitational interactions with giant galaxies within a cluster. This process of changing a galaxy&amp;apos;s morphology by interactions has been called &amp;quot;[[Interacting galaxy#Galaxy harassment|galaxy harassment]]&amp;quot;. Evidence for this latter hypothesis has been found in the form taken by stellar disks and spiral arms of [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]]. Under this alternative hypothesis the disks and arms are modified version of the original stellar disk of the transformed spiral galaxy, and similarly, small remnants of disks and arms are embedded within &amp;quot;harassed&amp;quot; dEs.
