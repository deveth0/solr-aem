__NOTOC__

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ihug&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was [[New Zealand]]&amp;apos;s third largest [[Internet service provider|ISP]] (behind [[Xtra (ISP)|Xtra]] and [[TelstraClear]]), before it was bought, then absorbed by [[Vodafone New Zealand]] (the country&amp;apos;s largest mobile phone operator). According to 2005 estimates, it had over 100,000 internet and phone subscribers. Before 2000 ihug was New Zealand&amp;apos;s largest &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ISP&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; but as other ISPs began offering flat rate services, some customers opted to transfer to those providers.

ihug originally stood for Internet Home Users Group, even though the name was seldom used. It was also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Internet Group&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;TIG&amp;apos; in Australia. Ihug was sold to [[iiNet]] in 2003 before being sold to Vodafone in 2006 after interest from then [[Television New Zealand]] subsidiary [[Kordia|THL]] and competitor [[Orcon Internet Limited|Orcon]]. Its headquarters are in [[Auckland]], New Zealand. The former CEO was [[Mark Rushworth]], who became Manager of Marketing at Vodafone NZ.

The company also ran a small subscription television service in Auckland for a short period.

After Vodafone shut down the ihug name in April 2008, existing customers were moved to Vodafone&amp;apos;s own internet services, although customers had the choice of retaining their email addresses.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/3/story.cfm?c_id=3&amp;amp;objectid=10488214|title=Vodafone shuts down ihug brand|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=23 January 2008|author=Helen Twose}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
