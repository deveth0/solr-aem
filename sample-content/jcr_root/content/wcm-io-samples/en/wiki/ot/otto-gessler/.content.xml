&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Otto Karl Gessler&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Geßler&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (February 6, 1875 &amp;amp;ndash; March 24, 1955) was a [[Germany|German]] [[politician]] during the [[Weimar Republic]]. From 1910 until 1914, he was mayor of [[Regensburg]] and from 1913 to 1919 [[mayor of Nuremberg]]. He served in Weimar cabinets from 1919 until 1928, usually as [[Defence Minister of Germany|Minister of Defence]].

==Biography==
Gessler was born in [[Ludwigsburg]] in the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]]. He studied law in [[Erlangen]], [[Tübingen]] and [[Leipzig]] and received his doctorate there in 1900. Later he became mayor of [[Regensburg]] and lord mayor of [[Nuremberg]]. Because of a disease he was not actively involved in [[World War I]].

Gessler was one of the founders of the [[German Democratic Party|DDP]] in 1919. After the [[Kapp Putsch]] he assumed the office of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reichswehrministerium&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from [[Gustav Noske]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Quigley|first=Carroll|title=Tragedy And Hope|year=1966|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0-945001-10-X|pages=425|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=KQZxAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;q=tragedy+and+hope&amp;amp;dq=tragedy+and+hope&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=P_gAndEgun&amp;amp;sig=w8Gu9MX-yMpF-K9h6BAORE5zQJY&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=YG8zUIOCG6fYigfc14GADA&amp;amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; of which he was in charge of for different [[chancellor]]s. As &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Defence minister|Reichswehrminister]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; he worked closely with the head of the [[Oberste Heeresleitung|Heeresleitung]] [[Hans von Seeckt]]. Because of the accusation of financial anomalies in his ministry associated with the secret [[armament]] of the [[Reichswehr]] (the Phoebus scandal)Gessler had to resign in January 1928. From 1928 to 1933 he was president of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[German War Graves Commission]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bund zur Erneuerung des Reiches&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. After the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Machtergreifung]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]], he retired from politics in 1933. He was initiated in the plans of the resistance and was arrested after the [[July 20 Plot|assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler]] on 20 July 1944. He was detained in a concentration camp until the end of the war.

After the end of [[World War II]], Gessler became involved in the [[German Red Cross]], of which he was chairman from 1950 to 1952.

From 1950 to 1955 Gessler was member of the [[Bavarian senate]].

The hospital in [[Lindenberg im Allgäu]] is named for Gessler.
