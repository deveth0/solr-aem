&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Otto&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Othon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[French language|French]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oddone&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Italian language|Italian]]) (1010/1020 – {{circa|1057}}) was [[Counts of Savoy|a Count of Savoy]] from  1051 (or 1056) until his death.

He substantially enlarged his lands through his marriage. After this acquisition the [[House of Savoy]] concentrated their expansion efforts towards Italy instead of outside the Alps as they had done before. Savoy&amp;apos;s lands occupied much of modern [[Savoy]] and [[Piedmont]], although several other small states could be found between them.

==Family==
He was son of [[Umberto I, Count of Savoy|Humbert]], the first Count of Savoy, and his wife Ancilla of Lenzburg, and ascended the throne after the death of his elder brother, [[Amadeus I of Savoy]].

In 1046 he married [[Adelaide of Susa|Adelaide]], heiress of [[Turin]] and [[Susa, Italy|Susa]]. They had five children:

* [[Peter I, Count of Savoy|Peter]]
* [[Amadeus II, Count of Savoy|Amadeus]]
* Otto&amp;lt;!--The identification of him as &amp;quot;bishop of Asti&amp;quot; is wrong!! See Ludovico Vergano, Storia di Asti, part I.--&amp;gt;
* [[Bertha of Savoy|Bertha]], Countess of Moriana (died 1087)
* Adelaide (died 1080), married [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolf of Swabia]]
