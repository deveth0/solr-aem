&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Otter&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[Automated theorem proving|automated theorem prover]] developed by [[William McCune]] at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] in Illinois. Otter was the first widely distributed, high-performance theorem prover for [[first-order logic]], and it pioneered a number of important implementation techniques. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Otter&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an acronym for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Organized Techniques for Theorem-proving and Effective Research&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Otter has been very stable for a number of years but is no longer actively developed. As of November 2008, the last changelog entry was dated 14 September 2004. A successor to Otter is [[Prover9]].

The software is in the [[public domain]]. The [[University of Chicago]] has declined to assert its copyrights in this software, and it may be used, modified, and redistributed (with or without modifications) by the public. However, &amp;quot;NEITHER THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT NOR ANY AGENCY THEREOF [...] REPRESENTS THAT ITS USE WOULD NOT INFRINGE PRIVATELY OWNED RIGHTS.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;File name Legal in the [http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/otter/otter-3.3f.tar.gz tarball]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

According to Wos and Pieper, OTTER is written in approximately 28,000 lines of C programming language.
