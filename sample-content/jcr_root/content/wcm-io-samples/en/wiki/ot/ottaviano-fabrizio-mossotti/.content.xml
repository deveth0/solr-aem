&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ottaviano-Fabrizio Mossotti&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1791-1863) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[physicist]] exiled from Italy for his [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas.  He later taught [[astronomy]] and [[physics]] at the [[University of Buenos Aires]].  His name is associated with a type of multiple-element [[lens (optics)|lens]] correcting [[spherical aberration]] and [[Coma (optics)|coma]], but not [[chromatic aberration]].  The [[Clausius-Mossotti]] formula is partly named after him. Mossotti was Chair of Experimental Physics in Buenos Aires (1827-1835) and taught numerous Argentinian physicians his views on [[dielectric]]s, thereby becoming influential on the Argentine-German [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] tradition as regards electricity inside brain tissue, and later (after 1906) on this tradition&amp;apos;s models of [[Standing wave|stationary waves]] in the [[hologram|interference]] of neural activity for short-term memory. He returned to Italy, participated in military actions after his age of sixty, and was appointed as Senator. There Mossotti also was influential on [[Hendrik Lorentz]]&amp;apos;s views on [[fundamental forces]], as well as more than five hundred mathematician students
