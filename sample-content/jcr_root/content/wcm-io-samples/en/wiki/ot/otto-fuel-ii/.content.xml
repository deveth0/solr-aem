&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Otto fuel II&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[monopropellant]] used to drive [[torpedo]]es and other weapon systems. It is not related to the [[Otto cycle]].

==Properties==
This distinct-smelling, reddish-orange, oily liquid is a mixture of three synthetic substances: [[propylene glycol dinitrate]] (the major component), [[2-Nitrodiphenylamine|2-nitrodiphenylamine]], and [[dibutyl sebacate]].&amp;lt;ref name=cdc&amp;gt;http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=780&amp;amp;tid=152&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

It does not need exposure to any [[oxidant]] to ignite and release energy, as its three components will react among themselves whenever vaporised and heated. Needing no oxidants and being a stable substance makes Otto fuel ideal for use in the constrained environment of a submarine. Although the fuel can be made to explode, this requires extreme conditions (such that it can be regarded as practically stable). The [[vapour pressure]] of the fuel is low (i.e., it is not volatile), minimising toxic hazards. Finally, the fuel&amp;apos;s [[energy density]] far surpasses the capacity of the [[electric battery]] used in other torpedoes, maximising range.

==Major ingredients==
Named after its inventor, Dr [[Otto Reitlinger]], Otto Fuel II consists of the nitrated [[ester]]
explosive [[propellant]] propylene glycol dinitrate (PGDN), to which a [[Phlegmatized|desensitizer]] (dibutyl sebacate) and a [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizer]] (2-nitrodiphenylamine) have been added. The chief
component, propylene glycol dinitrate, accounts for approximately 75% of the mixture, while dibutyl
sebacate and 2-nitrodiphenylamine account for approximately 23% and 2%, respectively.

The principal current use of propylene glycol dinitrate is as a propellant in Otto Fuel II.
[[Nitrate]]s of [[polyhydric alcohol]]s, of which propylene glycol dinitrate is an example, have been
used in medicine for the treatment of [[angina pectoris]], and as [[explosive]]s since the mid-nineteenth century.

In addition to its use by the [[U.S. Navy]] as a stabilizer in the manufacture of Otto Fuel II,
2-nitrodiphenylamine is employed for similar purposes by the [[U.S. Army]] in the manufacture of double base solid propellants. It also has civilian applications as a [[solvent dye]].

Dibutyl sebacate is a desensitizer in Otto Fuel II. However, its major use is as a [[plasticizer]] in production of plastics, namely [[cellulose acetate butyrate]], [[cellulose acetate propionate]], [[polyvinyl butyral]], [[polystyrene]], and many [[synthetic rubber]]s. It can be used for plastics in use in the food [[packaging and labelling|packaging]] industry. It is also used as a [[lubricant|lubricating ingredient]] in shaving lotions, and a flavoring additive in [[non-alcoholic beverage]]s, [[ice cream]], ices, candy, and baked goods.

==Toxicity==
Otto fuel II is a toxic substance found in EPA&amp;apos;s National Priorities List. Ingestion of contaminated food or direct exposure at worksites can cause headaches, poor eyeâ€“hand coordination, eye irritation, congested noses, nausea, dizziness, and difficulty breathing.&amp;lt;ref name=cdc/&amp;gt; Fresh air and black coffee used to relive exposure symptoms. No fatal cases of overexposure have yet been reported.

==Used in==

* [[Mark 46 torpedo]]
* [[Spearfish torpedo]]
* [[Yu-6 torpedo]]
