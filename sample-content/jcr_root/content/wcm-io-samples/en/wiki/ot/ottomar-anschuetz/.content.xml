&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ottomar Anschütz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (16 May 1846 in German Lissa &amp;amp;ndash; 30 May 1907 in Berlin) was a German inventor, photographer, and [[chronophotographer]].

==Biography==
He invented 1/1000 of a second [[shutter (photography)|shutter]], and the &amp;quot;electrotachyscope&amp;quot; in 1887. The electrotachyscope was a disk of 24 glass diapositives, manually powered, and illuminated by a sparking [[spiral]] [[Geissler tube]], used by a single viewer, or projected to a small group.

In 1887 Anschütz developed the Projecting [[Electrotachyscope]], in 1891 a slightly smaller, powered version,  the &amp;quot;[[Electrical Schnellseher]]&amp;quot; (i.e. quick viewer), was being manufactured by [[Siemens &amp;amp; Halske]] in Berlin, used in a public [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] and was displayed at the International Electrotechnical Exhibition in [[Frankfurt]]. Nearly 34,000 people paid to see it at the Berlin Exhibition Park in summer 1892 also [[Strand, London]] and at the 1893 [[World&amp;apos;s Columbian Exposition|Chicago World&amp;apos;s Fair]].

His 1884 [[albumen]] [[photography]] of [[storks]] inspired [[aviation]] pioneer [[Otto Lilienthal]]&amp;apos;s experimental [[Glider aircraft|gliders]] in the late 1880s.
