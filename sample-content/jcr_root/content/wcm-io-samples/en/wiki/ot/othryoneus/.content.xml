&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Othryoneus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Ὀθρυονεύς) was in [[Greek mythology]] a [[suitor]] of Princess [[Cassandra]] of [[Troy]] during the [[Trojan War]], mentioned in one passage in Homer&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Iliad]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Othryoneus was from Cabesos, a Homeric site over whose location there has been disagreements since ancient times, some sources suggesting a site in the [[Troad]] self and others pointing at the very similar name of the ancient site of Kavissos, today near [[Feres, Evros|Feres]] near [[Evros (regional unit)|Evros]]. Othryoneus had taken part in the war in the sole purpose of marrying [[King Priam]]&amp;apos;s daughter, the &amp;quot;loveliest&amp;quot; according to Homer, and to which the King had assented. In the Iliad, he is killed during the Battle of the Ships by [[Idomeneus]], in a passage in which he is cited as gleefully mocking him while Othryoneus is dying.
