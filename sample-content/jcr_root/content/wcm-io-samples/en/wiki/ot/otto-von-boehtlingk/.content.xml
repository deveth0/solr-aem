        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Otto von Böhtlingk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (May 30, 1815 – April 1, 1904) was a [[German people|German]] [[Indologist]] and [[Sanskrit grammarians|Sanskrit scholar]]. His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[magnum opus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a Sanskrit dictionary.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. Having studied (1833–1835) [[Oriental]] languages, particularly [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Sanskrit]], at the [[University of Saint Petersburg]], he continued his studies in Germany, first in [[Berlin]] and then (1839–1842) in [[Bonn]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Returning to Saint Petersburg in 1842, he was attached to the Royal Academy of Sciences, and was elected an ordinary member of that society in 1855. In 1860 he was made Russian state councillor, and later privy councillor with a title of nobility.In 1868 he settled at [[Jena]], and in 1885 moved to [[Leipzig]], where he resided until his death.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Scholarship==
Böhtlingk was one of the most distinguished scholars of the nineteenth century, and his works are of pre-eminent value in the field of Indian and comparative [[philology]]. His first great work was an edition of the Sanskrit [[grammar]] of [[Panini (scholar)|Panini]], {{IAST|[[Aṣṭādhyāyī]]}}, with a German [[Commentary (philology)|commentary]], under the title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Acht Bücher grammatischer Regeln&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Bonn, 1839–1840). This was in reality a criticism of [[Franz Bopp]]&amp;apos;s philological methods.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

This work was followed by:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Vopadeva]]s Grammatik&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Saint Petersburg, 1847)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Über die Sprache der [[Yakuts|Jakuten]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Saint Petersburg, 1851)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Indische Sprüche&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a series of Sanskrit apothegms and proverbial verses (2nd ed. in 3 parts, Saint Petersburg, 1870–1873, to which an index was published by Blau, Leipzig, 1893)
*a critical examination and translation of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Chandogya]]-[[upanishad]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Saint Petersburg, 1889)
*a translation of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Brihad-Aranyaka]]-[[upanishad]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Saint Petersburg, 1889)

His [[magnum opus]] was his great Sanskrit-German dictionary, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sanskrit-Wörterbuch&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (7 vols., Saint Petersburg, 1853–1875; shortened ed. (without citations) 7 vols, Saint Petersburg, 1879–1889), which with the assistance of his two friends, [[Rudolf Roth]] (d. 1895) and [[Albrecht Weber]] (b. 1825), was completed in 23 years.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He also published several smaller treatises, notably one on [[Vedic accent]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Über den Accent im Sanskrit&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1843).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Also notable are his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sanskrit-Chrestomathie&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Saint Petersburg, 1845; 2d ed., 1877–97), and an edition with translation of a treatise on Hindu poetics by [[Daṇḍin]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kāvyādarsa&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Leipzig, 1890).&amp;lt;ref name=NIE&amp;gt;{{Cite NIE|Böhtlingk, Otto von|year=1905}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Böhtlingk took up Panini&amp;apos;s grammar again, 47 years after his first edition, when he republished it with a complete translation under the title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Panini&amp;apos;s Grammatik mit Übersetzung&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Leipzig, 1887).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
