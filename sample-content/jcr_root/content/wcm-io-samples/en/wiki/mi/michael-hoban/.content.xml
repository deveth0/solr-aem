&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Brian Michael Stanislaus Hoban&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (7 October 1921, [[British Guiana]] &amp;amp;ndash; 6 July 2003), was a teacher of classics, and Headmaster of [[Harrow School]] from 1971-81.

His father died when he was a small child and he spent two years in an orphanage. In 1934 he won a scholarship to [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]], where he remained until the onset of [[World War II]] in 1939. He spent the war as a captain with the [[Westminster Dragoons]], and was [[mentioned in dispatches]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

From 1946-49 he was a student of classics at [[University College, Oxford]]. In 1947 he married Jasmine Holmes, the daughter of his Charterhouse house master. From 1949-52 he was an assistant master at [[Uppingham School]] teaching classics. From 1952-59 he was an assistant master at [[Shrewsbury School]] teaching classics. From 1960-64 he was Headmaster of [[St Edmund&amp;apos;s School]], [[Canterbury]].

From 1964-71, he was Headmaster of [[Bradfield College]]. In 1971 he was named Headmaster of Harrow. He headed Harrow at a difficult time for British [[public school (England)|public schools]] generally, due to the political environment and financial pressures. Despite sometimes public criticism, Hoban responded with cost-saving measures, whilst refurbishing houses. During his tenure at Harrow, numbers slipped below 700 only three times. He oversaw many important building projects, including the new Central Feeding block; the New Knoll boarding house; and new physics and maths schools. He retired in 1981.
