&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mictlan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-nah|&amp;apos;mikt͡ɬaːn}}) was the [[underworld]] of [[Aztec mythology]].  Most people who died went to Mictlan, although other possibilities existed (see &amp;quot;Other Destinations,&amp;quot; below).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Smith2009p207&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  Mictlan was located far to the north,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} and consisted of nine distinct levels.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Smith2009p207&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

The journey from the first level to the ninth was difficult and took four years, but the dead were aided by the [[psychopomp]], [[Xolotl]]. The dead had to pass many challenges, such as crossing a mountain range where the mountains crashed into each other, a field with wind that blew flesh-scraping knives, and a river of blood with fearsome jaguars.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Mictlan was ruled by a king, [[Mictlantecuhtli]] (&amp;quot;Lord of the Underworld&amp;quot;)&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Smith2009p206&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; and his wife, [[Mictecacihuatl]] (&amp;quot;Lady of the Underworld&amp;quot;).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Soustelle, Jacques (Patrick O&amp;apos;Brian, translator) (1961). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Daily Life of the Aztecs on the Eve of the Spanish Conquest&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Stanford: Stanford University Press. p. 107.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Other deities in Mictlan included [[Cihuacoatl (goddess)|Cihuacoatl]] (who commanded Mictlan spirits called [[Cihuateteo]]), [[Acolnahuacatl (deity)|Acolmiztli]], [[Chalmecacihuilt]], [[Chalmecatl]] and [[Acolnahuacatl (deity)|Acolnahuacatl]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Other destinations==
In addition to Mictlan, the dead could also go to a number of other destinations:
*Warriors who died in battle and those who died as a sacrifice went east and accompanied the sun during the morning.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Smith2009p207&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
*Women who died in [[childbirth]] went to the west and accompanied the sun when it set in the evening.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite book|last=Coe| first=Michael D. |title=Mexico: From the Olmecs to the Aztecs |year=1994| edition=4 |place=London |publisher=Thames and Hudson |page=183 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
*People who died of drowning — or from other causes that were seen as linked to the rain god [[Tlaloc]], such as certain diseases and lightning — went to a paradise called [[Tlalocan]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Smith2009p207&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
