        text="&lt;p&gt;A microbody is a type of [[organelle]] that is found in the cells of plants, protozoa, and animals. Organelles in the microbody family include [[Peroxisome|peroxisomes]], [[Glyoxysome|glyoxysomes]], [[Glycosome|glycosomes]] and [[Hydrogenosome|hydrogenosomes]].  In vertebrates, microbodies are especially prevalent in the liver and kidney organs.
==Structure==
[[File:peroxisome.jpg|thumb|Microbody Structure - A Peroxisome]]
A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;microbody&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is usually a [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]] with a spherical shape, ranging from 0.2-1.5 micrometers in diameter.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;smith1978&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Microbodies.&amp;quot; Molecular Biology of Plant Cells. Ed. H. Smith. N.p.: University of California, 1978. 136-54. Print.
&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Microbodies are found in the [[cytoplasm]] of a cell, but they are only visible with the use of an [[electron microscope]]. They are surrounded by a single phospholipid bilayer membrane and they contain a matrix of intracellular material including [[Enzyme|enzymes]] and other proteins, but they do not seem to contain any genetic material to allow them to self-replicate.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;smith1978&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
==Function==

Microbodies contain enzymes that participate in the preparatory or intermediate stages of [[Biochemistry|biochemical reactions]] within the cell. This facilitates the breakdown of fats, alcohols and amino acids. Different types of microbodies have different functions:
===Peroxisomes===
A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[peroxisome]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a type of microbody that functions to help the body break down large molecules and detoxify hazardous substances. It contains enzymes like [[oxidase]], which can create hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct of its enzymatic reactions. Within the peroxisome, hydrogen peroxide can then be converted to water by enzymes like [[catalase]] and [[peroxidase]].
===Glyoxysomes===
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Glyoxysome|Glyoxysomes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are specialized peroxisomes found in plants and [[mold]], which help to convert stored lipids into carbohydrates so they can be used for plant growth. In glyoxysomes the fatty acids are hydrolyzed to acetyl-CoA by peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes. Besides peroxisomal functions, glyoxysomes also possess the key enzymes of the [[Glyoxylate cycle]].

== History ==

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Microbodies&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were first discovered and named in 1954 by Rhodin.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;deduveandbaudhuin&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
{{cite journal | author = de Duve C and Baudhuin P | title = [http://physrev.physiology.org/content/46/2/323.full.pdf Peroxisomes (Microbodies and Related Particles)] | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 46 | pages = 303 | year = 1966}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Two years later in 1956, Rouiller and Bernhard presented the first worldwide accepted images of microbodies in liver cells.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;deduveandbaudhuin&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; Then in 1965, Christian de Duve and coworkers isolated microbodies from the liver of a rat. De Duve also believed that the name Microbody was too general and chose the name of [[Peroxisome]] because of its relationship with hydrogen peroxide.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;pmid4389648&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal | author = de Duve C | title = The peroxisome: a new cytoplasmic organelle | journal = Proc. R. Soc. Lond., B, Biol.
