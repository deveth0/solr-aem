&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Miquelon-Langlade&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the less populated of the two [[commune in France|communes]] (municipalities) making up the French [[Collectivité d&amp;apos;outre-mer|overseas collectivity]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], in [[North America]]. They are located to the south of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The communal seat is the settlement of [[Miquelon, Miquelon-Langlade|Miquelon]] in the north of Miquelon Island.

==Geography==
Miquelon-Langlade is made up of three geologically distinct islands bound together by [[tombolo]]s: long strips of sand dune. These islands are: Le Cap, [[Miquelon Island]] (Grand Miquelon) and [[Langlade Island]] (Petite Miquelon).

Miquelon Island has a large [[lagoon]] known as the [[Grand Barachois]] which is host to a large population of [[Seal (mammal)|seal]]s and other wildlife. Miquelon is also a well known destination for bird watching.

==History==
The name Miquelon is of [[Basque language|Basque]] origin and means &amp;quot;Michael&amp;quot;, as several fishermen with this name were established in the island. In 1579, the names &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Micquetõ&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Micquelle&amp;apos;&amp;apos; appeared for the first time in [[Martin de Hoyarçabal]]&amp;apos;s navigational pilot. The name evolved over time into &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Miclon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Micklon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and finally &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Miquelon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Demographics==

The population of Miquelon-Langlade is mainly of [[Basque people|Basque]] and [[Acadian]] ancestry. The population of Miquelon-Langlade was 616 at the January 2006 local census, 615 of whom lived on Miquelon.

Langlade is uninhabited. The sole resident at the time of the 2006 census, Charles Lafitte, died in July 2006. Lafitte was widely known on the islands as &amp;quot;de Gaulle&amp;quot;, and lived as a hermit on Langlade for many years with his dogs.

==Transportation==
Miquelon can be reached by boat or by plane from [[Saint-Pierre, Saint-Pierre and Miquelon|Saint-Pierre]] and is served by [[Miquelon Airport]] which is located adjacent to the settlement of [[Miquelon, Miquelon-Langlade|Miquelon]]. The airport is served by [[Air Saint-Pierre]] with flights both to [[Saint Pierre Airport]] and [[Canada]].
