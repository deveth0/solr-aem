&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mixed pickles&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are [[pickling|pickle]]s made from a variety of vegetables mixed in the same pickling process. Mixed pickles are eaten much like other pickles: in small amounts to add flavor and to accent a meal.

Mixed pickles occur in many different world cuisines.

In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Cuisine of the United States|U.S. cuisine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a mixed pickle consists of vegetables typically including [[cucumbers]], [[cauliflower]], cut large [[onion]]s, and [[bell pepper]]s, as well as [[spices]] like [[garlic]], [[dill]], [[allspice]], and [[chili pepper|chili]] peppers, suspended in [[vinegar]]. Mixed pickles may also be categorized as [[sweet]] or [[sour]] depending on the addition of a sweetening agent like [[sugar]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELDEV3010786 http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELDEV3010786] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ams.usda.gov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[British cuisine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, mixed pickles typically include small whole onions, [[gherkin]]s, and cauliflower. Some specific kinds of British mixed pickle are [[Branston pickle]] (more properly termed a [[relish]]), and [[piccalilli]] (the latter also found in U.S. cuisine).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3100168 http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3100168] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;bbc.co.uk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Indian cuisine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a mixed [[Indian pickle]] is more likely to contain fruits (for example, [[mango]]s and [[Lime (fruit)|limes]]) as well as vegetables. Indian pickle is prepared using oil, unlike western pickles, and is more likely to use lemon juice or some other acid as a souring agent instead of vinegar. There are regional variations in spicing and in the ingredients.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://indianfoodsco.com/Submit/Pickles.htm http://indianfoodsco.com/Submit/Pickles.htm] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;indianfoodsco.com&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Recipes for mixed pickles can also be found in [[Chinese cuisine]], [[Middle Eastern cuisine]], and many other world cuisines.
