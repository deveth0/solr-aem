&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Michael Scott&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (30 October 1789 – 7 November 1835) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] author and autobiographer who wrote under the pseudonym &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tom Cringle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Life and work==
Scott was born in [[Scotland]] at [[Cowlairs]], near [[Glasgow]], the son of a Glasgow merchant.

In 1806 he went to [[Jamaica]], first managing some estates, and afterwards joining a business firm in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. The latter post necessitated his making frequent journeys, on the incidents of which he based his best known book, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tom Cringle&amp;apos;s Log&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 1822 he left Jamaica and settled in Glasgow, where he engaged in business. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tom Cringle&amp;apos;s Log&amp;apos;&amp;apos; began to appear serially in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Blackwood&amp;apos;s Magazine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1829. Scott’s second story, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Cruise of the Midge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was also first published serially in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Blackwood&amp;apos;s&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1834–1835. The first appearance in book-form of each story was in Paris in 1834. Both stories - &amp;quot;interesting autobiographical portraits of jamaica in the 1820s, written by a perceptive and sympathetic, but transient observer&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Michael Hughes, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Companion to West Indian Literature&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Collins, 1979, p. 116.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; - were originally published anonymously, and their authorship was not known till after Scott&amp;apos;s death at Glasgow.
