&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sir Michael David Kadoorie, [[Gold Bauhinia Star|GBS]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1941, [[Hong Kong]]) is a business executive and philanthropist. As of March 2011, he is the 6th wealthiest person in Hong Kong, with the wealth of his family estimated to be 6.1 billion [[US dollars]] according to Forbes&amp;apos; annual [[List of billionaires (2007)|list of billionaires]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-kadoorie Michael Kadoorie &amp;amp; family - Forbes.com]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The son of business tycoon [[Lord Kadoorie|Lawrence Kadoorie]] (1899–1993) and his wife, Muriel Gubbay, Michael Kadoorie was educated at [[Kowloon Junior School]] in [[Hong Kong]] as well as [[Institut Le Rosey]] in [[Switzerland]]. His family’s roots in business in the Far East go back to his grandfather, a descendant of [[Iraq]]i Jews originally from [[Baghdad]], who first settled in Shanghai in 1880. After a spell in Bombay, India, his grandfather made a fortune in Shanghai, mostly lost in 1949, and later, in Hong Kong through finance, real estate and utilities. Headquartered in Hong Kong soon after 1949, Kadoorie&amp;apos;s father and uncle successfully expanded the family businesses into a diversified group, led by the company flagship [[China Light and Power|CLP Holdings Ltd.]]

Kadoorie is the Chairman of [[China Light and Power|CLP Holdings Ltd.]] which his family founded in 1890 and in which they still hold a 35% stake. The utility company provides electricity to 75% of Hong Kong as sole operator (licensed through a Scheme of Control) in Kowloon and the New Territories, and has equity interests in power plants in [[China]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Australia]] and [[India]]. He is also the Chairman of the family&amp;apos;s second largest listed group, The Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels, owners and operators of the world-renowned [[The Peninsula Hong Kong|Peninsula Hotel Group]]. He controls and is a director of [[Metrojet Ltd.]] Heliservices (Hong Kong) Limited and has initiated CLP Research Institute (a subsidiary of CLP Holdings which looks into renewable energy development). He holds a number of directorships in other non-Kadoorie companies. He was a member of the Council of the [[University of Hong Kong]] and, in 2000, the Kadoorie Biological Sciences Building opened at the university.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Awards==
A trustee of the Kadoorie Charitable Foundation, Michael Kadoorie was made an Officer of the [[Legion of Honor]] by the government of [[France]] and a Commander of the [[Order of Léopold II]] of [[Belgium]]. He was also awarded a knighthood, as a [[Knight Bachelor]], in the Queen&amp;apos;s Birthday Honours List on 11 June 2005. In 2004, the [[University of Hong Kong]] awarded him an honorary LLD. {{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Personal life==
A photography buff, Kadoorie is also a helicopter pilot and a fan of classic cars. He is the owner of a number of rare automobiles including a [[Bugatti Type 57]], a 1932 [[Rolls-Royce Phantom II]] Thrupp &amp;amp; Maberly, a 1934 [[Hispano-Suiza]] J12 Van Vooren Cabriolet, a 1969 [[Lamborghini Miura]] P400 S, a 1924 [[Vauxhall Prince Henry|Vauxhall 30-98]] Tourer and a [[Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In 1998, he spent two months recovering from serious injuries at the John Radcliffe Hospital in [[Oxford, England]] after having an accident in his vintage [[Ferrari]] when the spokes in two of the rebuilt wheels tore through the tyres.

==Family==
He lives in Hong Kong with his wife, Lady Betty; they have three children.
