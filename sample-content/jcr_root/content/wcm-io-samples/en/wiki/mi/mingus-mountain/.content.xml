&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mingus Mountain&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-yuf|ya|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hwa:lkya単a単a&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}) is a [[mountain]] located in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Arizona]] in the [[Black Hills (Arizona)|Black Hills]] [[mountain range]]. It is located within the [[Prescott National Forest]] traversed by [[Arizona State Route 89A|State Route 89A]] approximately midway between [[Cottonwood, Arizona|Cottonwood]] and [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]]. The summit can be reached via [[Forest Service Road|Forest Service roads]] that branch off from Highway 89A. From the mountain, there are views of the [[Verde Valley]], [[Sycamore Canyon Wilderness]] and the towns of [[Cottonwood, Arizona|Cottonwood]], [[Jerome, Arizona|Jerome]], and [[Clarkdale, Arizona|Clarkdale]]. The [[Woodchute Wilderness]], north of the summit of 89A, also offers views and hiking trails. There are several [[United States National Forest|National Forest]] [[campground]]s in the area and it is the transmitter location for Prescott full-service television station [[KAZT-TV]] and several low-power television stations serving Cottonwood, Clarkdale, [[Camp Verde, Arizona|Camp Verde]] and [[Prescott Valley, Arizona|Prescott Valley]].

According to the book, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Roadside History of Arizona&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, by [[Marshall Trimble]], &amp;quot;Mingus Mountain was named for Joseph and Jacob Mingus, two brothers who settled in the area in the 1880s and later operated a sawmill near the base of the mountain&amp;quot;. Another source&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;2006, T. Stone, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grave History&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ISBN 978-0-9778545-0-9, p. 223&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; attributes the name to William Mingus (d. 1911, [[Prescott, Arizona]]), a pioneer prospector who lived and worked on Mingus Mountain in the 1870s.
