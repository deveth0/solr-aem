&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mirosław Hermaszewski&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born September 15, 1941), is a retired [[Polish Air Force]] officer. He became the first (and to this day remains the only) [[Poles|Polish]] national in space when he flew aboard the [[Soyuz 30]] spacecraft in 1978.

==Early life==

Mirosław Hermaszewski was born in Lipniki, [[Wołyń Voivodeship (1921–1939)|Wolynian Voivodship]] in the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]], in present day - [[Ukraine]].

==Intercosmos program==

In 1965, he graduated from the military pilot school in [[Dęblin]]. In 1978, he was chosen from almost 500 Polish pilots to take part in the [[Intercosmos]] space program. Together with [[Pyotr Klimuk]], he spent almost eight days on board the [[Salyut 6]] [[space station]] (from 17:27, June 27, 1978 &amp;apos;til 16:31, July 5). During their time in orbit, they carried out [[geoscience]] experiments and photographed the Earth.

They landed 300&amp;amp;nbsp;km west of [[Tselinograd]]. He was awarded with the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] title for that flight.

==Afterwards==

During the period of martial law in Poland, Hermaszewski was a member of the [[Military Council of National Salvation]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wojskowa Rada Ocalenia Narodowego&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, WRON), a military quasi-government. Later, he was a commander of the Fighter Pilots School in [[Dęblin]]. In 1988, he was promoted to [[general]].

Between 1991 and 1992, Hermaszewski served as a second-in-command of the Headquarters of the Airforce. He is currently retired.

Mirosław Hermaszewski enjoys [[science fiction]] novels, hunting, [[sailing]] and various other sports.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} He is married to Emilia Hermaszewska and has two children, Miroslaw (born 1966) and Emilia (born 1974).
