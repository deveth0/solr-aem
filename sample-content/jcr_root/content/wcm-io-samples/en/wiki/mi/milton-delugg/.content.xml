        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Milton DeLugg&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born December 2, 1918; [[Los Angeles, California]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[composer]] and [[arranger]].

==Biography==
A talented accordionist, he appeared in short [[Soundies]] musicals and occasional movies (like 1949&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Jolson Sings Again]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). He quickly became a successful arranger and composer and worked as band leader at Slapsy Maxie&amp;apos;s Wilshire location in Hollywood. His clients ranged from the American Junior Miss Pageant to [[Jackie Wilson]], and he was a musician on such radio programs as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The [[Abe Burrows]] Show&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. One of his best-known tunes is an arrangement of the song &amp;quot;[[The Happy Wanderer]]&amp;quot;, and his brassy polka &amp;quot;[[Hoop Dee Doo]]&amp;quot; became a [[game show]] staple. He is also the composer of &amp;quot;Hooray for Santy Claus&amp;quot;, the catchy theme song for the low-budget motion picture &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Santa Claus Conquers the Martians]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos; He also composed &amp;quot;Roller Coaster&amp;quot; - recorded by Henri Rene Orchestra on [[RCA Victor]]. It was used as the closing theme for the popular [[Goodson-Todman]] panel show &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[What&amp;apos;s My Line?]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from the early 1950s until its cancellation in 1967.

In 1950 and 1951, DeLugg was musical director, bandleader, and accordionist on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Broadway Open House]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; an [[NBC]] late-night television program which has been considered a forerunner to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Tonight Show]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He often played a song he co-wrote, titled, &amp;quot;[[Orange Colored Sky]]&amp;quot;, which was best remembered as a hit for [[Nat King Cole]].  In 1950, DeLugg was also orchestra conductor for the short-lived &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Abe Burrows&amp;apos; Almanac]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 1953, he played accordion, leading the Milton DeLugg Trio on the short-lived &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bill Cullen]] Show&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.[http://userdata.acd.net/ottinger/cullen/shows/billshow.html] Four years later, in 1957, DeLugg joined the cast of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Winchell and Mahoney Show&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 1958, Milton DeLugg produced [[Buddy Holly]]&amp;apos;s famous record &amp;quot;[[Rave On!]]&amp;quot;

For decades, DeLugg has been associated with [[NBC]] as a musical director. In 1966, he was briefly musical director of [[The Tonight Show Band]] during the tenure of [[Johnny Carson]].

DeLugg enjoyed a long association with Chuck Barris, beginning as arranger of the original theme to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Newlywed Game]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1966. From 1976 to 1980, he was musical director of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Gong Show]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (appearing with his &amp;quot;Band With a Thug&amp;quot;). DeLugg often appeared on the show as a comic foil, in the characters of bad joke teller Naso Literatus and philosopher Old Drool. DeLugg&amp;apos;s venerable &amp;quot;Hoop Dee Doo&amp;quot; became a fixture on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Gong Show]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and was used whenever the contest winner was chosen.

DeLugg also wrote the theme music for other Barris projects including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The $1.98 Beauty Show]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Camouflage (game show)|Camouflage]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (where, in a throwback to an earlier era of game shows, the music was actually performed live by DeLugg and his band), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Leave It to The Women&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Three&amp;apos;s a Crowd]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Treasure Hunt (U.S. game show)|The New Treasure Hunt]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He also recorded new versions of the theme songs to the 1970s versions of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Dating Game]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Newlywed Game]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as well as providing the themes for their 1980s revivals. DeLugg and sidemen Mark Stevens, Billy Neale and Ray Neapolitan appeared in Chuck&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Gong Show Movie]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1980) as The Hollywood Cowboys.

DeLugg remains active today as musical director of the annual [[Macy&amp;apos;s Thanksgiving Day Parade]].
