{{Nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|三根町|Mine-chō}} was a [[towns of Japan|town]] located in [[Miyaki District, Saga|Miyaki District]], [[Saga Prefecture|Saga]], [[Japan]].

As of 2003, the town had an estimated [[population]] of 7,361 and a [[population density|density]] of 449.66 persons per km². Its total area was 16.37&amp;amp;nbsp;km².

Mine&amp;apos;s amenities include a sports centre, [[junior high school]], and two [[convenience store]]s. There is also a small [[library]] located somewhat towards the north. Mine has a small [[temple]] to a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] that is apparently able to cure [[wart]]s. Mine is technically in the prefecture of Saga, but the city of [[Kurume, Fukuoka|Kurume]] in Fukuoka prefecture is closer than the city of [[Saga, Saga|Saga]] and is used by far more people. The city is just across the river called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mamebashi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In June 2007 there was an industrial accident which resulted in a toxic cloud of [[hydrofluoric acid]] killing 129 and wounding 1267 others. The city is currently in discussions concerning a memorial.

The status of this municipality was changed from a village to a town on May 1, 1962.

On March 1, 2005 Mine was merged with the towns of [[Kitashigeyasu, Saga|Kitashigeyasu]] and [[Nakabaru, Saga|Nakabaru]], all from [[Miyaki District, Saga|Miyaki District]], to form the new town of [[Miyaki, Saga|Miyaki]].
