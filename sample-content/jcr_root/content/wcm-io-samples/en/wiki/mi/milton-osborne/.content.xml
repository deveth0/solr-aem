&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Milton Osborne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an Australian historian, author, and consultant specializing in Southeast Asia.

He attended North Sydney Boys High School, graduated from the [[University of Sydney]] and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from [[Cornell University]]. Osborne held academic positions in Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Singapore. Osborne&amp;apos;s main historical contribution has been to synthesise the history of the region as a whole, rather than concentrate on the histories of the present-day nations.

His Southeast Asia association began in 1959 with an Australian diplomatic posting to [[Phnom Penh]]. In 1980 and 1981 Osborne advised the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] on the Cambodian refugee problem. In 1982 he returned to Australia, working as Head of the Asia Branch of the [[Office of National Assessments]], also serving for a year as Head of Current Intelligence.

Osborne now lives in Sydney and continues to write while consulting on Asian issues.
