&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Misha Mengelberg&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born June 5, 1935, in [[Kiev]])&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;LF&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Feather, Leonard &amp;amp; Gitler, Ira (2007) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p. 459. Oxford University Press.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[jazz]] [[pianist]] and [[composer]]. He won the [[Gaudeamus International Composers Award]] in 1961.

==Biography==
Mengelberg was born in [[Kiev]] in [[Ukraine]], the son of the Dutch conductor [[Karel Mengelberg]], who was himself the nephew of the conductor [[Willem Mengelberg]]. His family moved back to the Netherlands in the late 1930s and the young Mengelberg began learning the piano at age five.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;LF&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; Mengelberg briefly studied [[architecture]] before entering the Royal Conservatory in [[The Hague]], where he studied music from 1958 to 1964. While there he won the first prize at a jazz festival in [[Loosdrecht]] and became associated with [[Fluxus]]. His early influences included [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Duke Ellington]] and [[John Cage]], whom he heard lecture at [[Darmstadt]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;am&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|title =Misha Mengelberg: Biography |first=Joslyn|last=Layne |publisher=Allmusic| url ={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=misha-mengelberg-p9183/biography|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate =30 January 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

His first appearance on record was on [[Eric Dolphy]]&amp;apos;s last album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Last Date (Eric Dolphy album)|Last Date]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1964). Also on that record was the drummer [[Han Bennink]], and the two of them, together with [[Piet Noordijk]], formed a quartet which had a number of different bassists, and which played at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in 1966.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;am&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; In 1967 he co-founded the [[Instant Composers Pool]], an organisation which promoted avant garde Dutch jazz performances and recordings, with Bennink and [[Willem Breuker]]. He was co-founder of [[STEIM]] in Amsterdam in 1969.

Mengelberg has played with a large variety of musicians. He has often performed in a duo with fellow Dutchman Bennink, with other collaborators including [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]], [[Peter BrÃ¶tzmann]], [[Evan Parker]], [[Anthony Braxton]], and (on the flip side of a live recording with Dolphy) his pet [[parrot]]. He was also one of the earliest exponents of the work of the once-neglected pianist [[Herbie Nichols]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;am&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

He has also written music for others to perform (generally leaving some room for improvisation) and has overseen a number of music [[theatre]] productions, which usually include a large element of [[absurdism|absurdist]] humour. A 2006 DVD release, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Afijn&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ICP/Data), is a primer on Mengelberg&amp;apos;s life and work, containing an 80-minute documentary and additional concert footage.

One of his students was [[Oscar van Dillen]].
