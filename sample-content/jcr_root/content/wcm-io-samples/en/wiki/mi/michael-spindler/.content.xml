        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Michael Spindler&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 22 December 1942 in [[Berlin]]), nicknamed &amp;quot;the Diesel&amp;quot; for his reputed around-the-clock work habits, was president and [[CEO]] of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] from 1993 to 1996.

Having joined Apple in 1980, he rose through the ranks in Apple&amp;apos;s European operations as President of Apple Europe and was chosen to take over as CEO when [[John Sculley]] was ousted by Apple&amp;apos;s [[board of directors]] in June 1993.
Spindler presided over several successful projects, such as the introduction of the [[PowerPC]], as well as some major failures, including the [[Apple Newton|Newton]] and the [[Copland (operating system)|Copland]] operating system. He also engaged in takeover discussions with [[IBM]], [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[Philips]], but when these went nowhere, he was in turn replaced by [[Gil Amelio]], on February 2, 1996.
