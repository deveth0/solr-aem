[[Image:Mikado.jpg|thumb|Mikado]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mikado&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[pick-up sticks]] game originating in [[Europe]]. In 1936 it was brought from [[Hungary]] to the [[United States|USA]] and was mostly called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;pick-up sticks&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This term is not very specific in respect to existing stick game variations. Probably the &amp;quot;Mikado&amp;quot; name was not used because it was a brand name of a game producer. The game got its name from the highest scoring (blue) stick &amp;quot;[[Mikado]]&amp;quot; ([[Emperor of Japan]]). The [[Buddhism|buddhistic]] [[Chien Tung]] also contains a stick called &amp;quot;emperor&amp;quot;.

The house of &amp;quot;Tsuchimikado&amp;quot; adapted in the 16th century some culture, possibly also the &amp;quot;Chien Tung&amp;quot; oracle. Maybe in the course of Japonism in the 19th / 20th century the &amp;quot;Zitterwackel&amp;quot; game had changed to &amp;quot;Mikado&amp;quot; (probably first named &amp;quot;Tsuchimikado&amp;quot;).

== Rules ==

The classic Mikado game consists of 41 sticks. They are coded with different values that have a total of 170 points and are around 15 cm long.

The sticks are bundled and taken in one hand that touches the table/ground. The release creates a circular jumble. Now one stick after another should be taken up without moving/touching others. The take away could be by hand, possibly through pressing on a stick&amp;apos;s tip or if one has already picked up a special stick (Mikado/Mandarin), it could be used as a helper, possibly to throw up another stick.

It is allowed to stand up on but not to leave the own place. A bad throw could be rerun and the rules should be kept strict in respect to moving sticks to enjoy the game.

On a fault the turn ends (the last stick taken is not counted). The next player bundles and drops the sticks again. After several rounds, normally five, the one with the highest score is the winner.

== Rule Variations ==

* The starting player could be determined with a die

On a player&amp;apos;s turn:
*the sticks are rebundled and dropped
*the stack is taken over from the previous player

Allowed helpers:
*only the Mikado if the player has at least one of all other sticks (Kuli, Samurai, Bonzen, Mandarin)
*Mikado (traditional)
*Mikado / Mandarin (simplified)
*Mikado / Mandarin / Bonzen (casual)

The last stick taken when the stack moves:
*added to the score
*not added
*not added and drop immediately  (stack take over variant)

*The exact sequence of Kuli, Samurai, Bonzen and Mandarin may double the points of a turn.

*A player who does not use the correct helper may lose all points of the actual turn.

|-
| Samurai  ||align=right|  5 points ||align=center| 10 sticks
