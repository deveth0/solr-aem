&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Michel Gauthier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-fr|miʃɛl ɡotje}}; born February 18, 1950 in [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]) is a [[Canadian]] politician, who served as leader of the [[Bloc Québécois]] from 1996 to 1997. He was [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] during this time.

== Biography ==
Born in Quebec City, Gauthier was first elected as a Member of the [[National Assembly of Quebec]]  for the [[Parti Québécois]] in 1981.  He won a seat in the [[Canadian House of Commons]] as a candidate the Bloc Québécois in 1993.

Gauthier was not one of the Bloc&amp;apos;s better-known [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs), but after [[Lucien Bouchard]] resigned to become [[Premier of Quebec]], Gauthier won the [[Bloc Québécois leadership elections|Bloc Québécois leadership election of 1996]], defeating [[Francine Lalonde]]. The vote was conducted among members of the party&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;directorate&amp;apos;&amp;apos; rather than by all members of the party, and this hurt Gauthier&amp;apos;s legitimacy.

His lack of profile resulted in some opposition parties mocking Gauthier as being the &amp;quot;faceless leader&amp;quot; of the opposition, as he was largely a political unknown in most of Canada and even in Quebec. Gauthier&amp;apos;s leadership was unpopular with the [[caucus]] due to alleged conservative views and lack of charisma, and facing a revolt by his MPs, Gauthier resigned in 1997.  He was succeeded by [[Gilles Duceppe]].

As a result of health issues after surgery, he announced in March 2007 that he would not run in the next federal election. He served as BQ [[House Leader]] from 1997-2007.  Gauthier also served as the chief campaign organizer.

He formally resigned on July 29, 2007, and became the host of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gauthier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a television news show, which began airing on [[TQS]] in September 2007.
