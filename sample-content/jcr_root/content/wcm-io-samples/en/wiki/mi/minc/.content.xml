&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;MINC&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;MINC is not [[C (programming language)|C]]&amp;quot;) is a data specification language written in the mid-1980s by a [[Princeton University]] graduate student named [[Lars Graf]]. This kind of naming is known as a &amp;quot;recursive acronym&amp;quot;.

It contains many (though not all) of the syntactical capabilities of the C programming language, and can be used to implement simple procedural programs that can be executed by a runtime [[parser]] (that is to say, MINC does not need to be compiled in any way).

MINC continues to be used only in a handful of programs written in the 1980s (e.g. [[Real-Time Cmix]]). It has been for all intents and purposes superseded by modern scripting languages such as [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and [[Tcl]].

A controversial aspect of the language is whether it is pronounced &amp;quot;mink&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;min-see&amp;quot;.
