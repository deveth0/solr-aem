The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;North Carolina State Treasurer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a statewide elected office in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[North Carolina]] responsible for overseeing the financial operations of state government. The current state treasurer is [[Janet Cowell]].

The office of state treasurer has existed since 1715; at that time, the treasurer was appointed by the lower house of the legislature. In 1740, the treasurer&amp;apos;s office was divided into two districts, and in 1779, into four. In 1784, the [[North Carolina General Assembly]] brought the treasurers under one single office, appointed jointly by both houses of the legislature.

Under the [[North Carolina Constitution]] of 1868, the treasurer became a position elected by popular vote, rather than appointed.

The North Carolina State Treasurer is an ex officio member of the [[North Carolina State Board of Education]], the State Board of [[North Carolina Community College System|Community Colleges]], the State Banking Commission, and the [[North Carolina Council of State|Council of State]].
