&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Norman Lovett&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 31 October 1946) is an [[England|English]] [[stand-up comedian]] and [[actor]], best known for the role of [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Red Dwarf]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; during the first, second, [[Nanarchy|seventh]] (as a guest star) and eighth series.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Lovett&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.normanlovett.co.uk/biography.php |title=About Norman |work=normanlovett.co.uk|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; His comedy has a quiet, dead-pan surrealism, and in 2000 he made a successful stand up tour, co-headlining with [[Chris Barrie]], who played [[Arnold Rimmer|Rimmer]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Red Dwarf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Lovett was born in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], [[Berkshire]]. Lovett is divorced and has two daughters, Lily and Kitty. Prior to his performing career, Lovett did office and manual work with the final job at  the Whitechapel Art Gallery as an attendant.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 1989, he appeared in his own surreal BBC2 sitcom called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[I, Lovett]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in which he played a character called Norman.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Lovett&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Seven years later, he played Dr. Lovett in the short-lived sitcom &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Asylum (TV series)|Asylum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Lovett&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; which spawned many other successful careers.

He has made a number of acting appearances such as the [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] in a TV adaptation of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[A Christmas Carol]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Mr Follett in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The History of Tom Jones]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Criminal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as well as the BBC sitcom &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Keeping Up Appearances]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and a cameo appearance in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the episode &amp;quot;Summer Holiday&amp;quot;. He has been in &amp;apos;The Bill&amp;apos; and three episodes of the Scottish sitcom [[Rab C Nesbitt]]. In 2006, he was the most recognizable face to grace the low-budget British horror film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Evil Aliens]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}. He even worked with Gordon The Gopher but prefers not to talk about it. He was also heard as the voice over for several [[Sugar Puffs]] adverts of the late 1980s which he said &amp;apos;Sugar Puffs, you&amp;apos;ll go monster mad for the honey.&amp;apos;{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 2009, Lovett said he would no longer take part in any further &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Red Dwarf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; productions, considering himself to have been mistreated by [[Grant Naylor Productions]]. He states that the final straw came when they asked him to keep his diary free for &amp;quot;[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth|Back To Earth]]&amp;quot; (a three-part special for [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]]) and subsequently did not inform him that he would not be required when production began.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wharf.co.uk/2009/05/norman-lovett-takes-red-dwarfs.html |title=Norman Lovett takes Red Dwarf&amp;apos;s male Holly offline |last1=Hill |first1=John |date=20 May 2009 |work=wharf.co.uk |publisher= |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

However, in November 2012, following the success of [[Red Dwarf X]], he stated that he has begun speaking with Doug Naylor again.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maidenhead-advertiser.co.uk/Entertainment/Theatre/Latest-Theatre-News/Red-Dwarf-star-Norman-Lovett-talks-about-his-new-show-25102012.htm |title=Red Dwarf star Norman Lovett talks about his new show |last1=Hall |first1=Amanda |date=1 November 2012 |work=maidenhead-advertiser.co.uk |publisher= |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
