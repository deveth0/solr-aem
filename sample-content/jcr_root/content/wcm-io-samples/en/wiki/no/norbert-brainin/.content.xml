&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Norbert Brainin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (12 March 1923 – 10 April 2005), was the first [[violin]]ist of the [[Amadeus Quartet]], one of the world&amp;apos;s most highly regarded [[string quartet]]s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2005/apr/11/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries Obituary: Norbert Brainin, The Guardian 11 April 2005]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Because of Brainin&amp;apos;s [[Jewish]] origin, he was driven out of [[Vienna]] after [[Hitler]]&amp;apos;s [[Anschluss]] of 1938, as were the violinist [[Siegmund Nissel]] and violist [[Peter Schidlof]]. Brainin and Schidlof met in a [[United Kingdom|British]] internment camp, many Jewish [[refugee]]s having had the misfortune of being confined by the British as &amp;quot;enemy [[Alien (law)|alien]]s&amp;quot; upon seeking refuge in the UK.

Brainin was released after a few months, but Schidlof remained in the camp, where he met Nissel. Finally Schidlof and Nissel were released, and the three of them were able to study with violin pedagogue [[Max Rostal]], who taught them free of charge. It was through Rostal that they met cellist [[Martin Lovett]], and in 1947 they formed the Brainin Quartet, which was renamed as the [[Amadeus Quartet]] in 1948.

The Amadeus was one of the most celebrated quartets of the 20th Century, and its members were awarded numerous honours, including:

* Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]], presented by the [[Queen Elizabeth II|Queen]] (1960)
* Doctorates from the Universities of [[University of London|London]], [[University of York|York]], and [[University of Caracas|Caracas]].
* The highest of all [[Germany|German]] awards, the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Grand Cross of Merit]].
* [[Austrian Decoration for Science and Art|Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art]] (1974)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/AB/AB_10542/imfname_251156.pdf | title = Reply to a parliamentary question | language = German | page=398 | trans_title = | format = pdf | accessdate = 19 October 2012 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The quartet disbanded in 1987 upon the death of Schidlof, who was regarded as irreplaceable by the surviving members. Norbert Brainin continued to perform as a soloist, often performing with pianist [[Günter Ludwig]]. In 1992, Brainin performed a [[benefit concert]] in Washington, D.C. for then-jailed presidential candidate [[Lyndon LaRouche]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Murphy, Caryle, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1294134.html &amp;quot;Fund-Raiser for LaRouche Draws Complaints at GU&amp;quot;], Washington Post, 12/07/1988&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

His instruments included the &amp;quot;Rode&amp;quot; [[Giuseppe Guarneri|Guarnerius del Gesu]] of 1734, the &amp;quot;Chaconne&amp;quot; Stradivarius of 1725 and the [[Gibson Stradivarius|&amp;quot;Gibson&amp;quot; Stradivarius]] of 1713.
