The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Northern Premier League]] First Division&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[football (soccer)|football]] league covering the [[North of England]]. After the creation of [[Conference North]]/[[Conference South|South]] in the [[2004-05 in English football|2004–05]] season it sat at level 8 of the [[English football league system]].

The champion team, together with the winners of a play-off between the 2nd to 5th places, were promoted to a level 7 league, usually the [[Northern Premier League Premier Division]]. The bottom two clubs may have been relegated to one of several level 9 leagues.

==Split==
At the beginning of the 2007–08 season, the league was split into the [[Northern Premier League Division One North]] and the [[Northern Premier League Division One South]]. This was to reflect a standardisation of the [[National League System]], in which the [[Northern Premier League]] and the [[Isthmian League]] had their first divisions split to reflect the situation in the [[Southern League (football)|Southern League]]. The Northern Premier League had wanted 20 teams per division but faced opposition from the Southern League because it feared massive movement from its [[Southern Football League Division One Midlands|Midlands Division]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.unibondleague.com/news.php?nid=4927 Official website]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
