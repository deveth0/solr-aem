&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Northrop Corporation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a leading United States [[aircraft]] manufacturer from its formation in 1939 until its merger with [[Grumman]] to form [[Northrop Grumman]] in 1994. The company is known for its development of the [[flying wing]] design, although only a few of these have entered service.

==History==
[[Jack Northrop]] founded three companies using his name.  The first was the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Avion Corporation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1927, which was absorbed in 1929 by the [[United Aircraft and Transport Corporation]] as a subsidiary named &amp;quot;Northrop Aviation Corporation&amp;quot;.  The parent company moved its operations to [[Kansas]] in 1931, and so Jack, along with [[Donald Wills Douglas, Sr.|Donald Douglas]], established a &amp;quot;Northrop Corporation&amp;quot; located in [[El Segundo, California]], which produced several successful designs, including the [[Northrop Gamma]] and [[Northrop Delta]].  However, labor difficulties led to the dissolution of the corporation by Douglas in 1937, and the plant became the El Segundo Division of [[Douglas Aircraft]].

Northrop still sought his own company, and so in 1939 established the &amp;quot;Northrop Corporation&amp;quot; in nearby [[Hawthorne, California]], a site located by co-founder [[Moye Stephens]]. The corporation ranked 100th among United States corporations in the value of [[World War II]] military production contracts;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] &amp;amp; [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and lasted until 1994.  It was there that the [[Northrop P-61 Black Widow|P-61 Black Widow]] [[night fighter]], the [[Flying Wing|flying wings]] ([[Northrop YB-35|B-35]] and [[Northrop YB-49|YB-49]]), the [[Northrop F-89 Scorpion|F-89 Scorpion]] [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]], the [[SM-62 Snark]] intercontinental [[cruise missile]], and the [[Northrop F-5|F-5 Freedom Fighter]] economical jet fighter (and its derivative, the successful [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38 Talon]] trainer) were developed and built.

The F-5 was so successful that Northrop spent much of the 1970s and 1980s attempting to duplicate its success with similar light-weight designs. Their first attempt to improve the F-5 was the N-300, which featured much more powerful engines and moved the wing to a higher position to allow for increased ordnance that the higher power allowed. The N-300 was further developed into the P-530 with even larger engines, this time featuring a small amount of &amp;quot;bypass&amp;quot; ([[turbofan]]) to improve cooling and allow the engine bay to be lighter, as well as much more wing surface. The P-530 also included radar and other systems considered must-haves on modern aircraft. When the [[Light Weight Fighter]] program was announced, the P-530 was stripped of much of its equipment to become the P-600, and eventually the [[Northrop YF-17 Cobra|YF-17 Cobra]], which lost the competition to the [[General Dynamics]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]].

Nevertheless, the YF-17 Cobra was modified with help from [[McDonnell Douglas]] to become the McDonnell Douglas [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornet]] in order to fill a similar light-weight design competition for the [[US Navy]]. Northrop intended to sell a de-navalized version as the F-18L, but the basic F-18A continued to outsell it, leading to a long and fruitless lawsuit between the two companies. Northrop continued to build much of the F-18 fuselage and other systems after this period, but also returned to the original F-5 design with yet another new engine to produce the [[Northrop F-20 Tigershark|F-20 Tigershark]] as a low-cost aircraft. This garnered little interest in the market, and the project was dropped.

Based on the experimentation with [[Flying Wing|flying wings]] the company developed the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] stealth bomber of the 1990s.

In 1994, partly due to the loss of the [[Advanced Tactical Fighter]] contract to [[Lockheed Martin]] and the removal of their proposal from consideration for the [[Joint Strike Fighter Program|Joint Strike Fighter competition]], the company bought [[Grumman]] to form [[Northrop Grumman]].
