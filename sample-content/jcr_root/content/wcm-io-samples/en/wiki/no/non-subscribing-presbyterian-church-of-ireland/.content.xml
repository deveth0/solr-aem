The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; derives its name and its liberal and tolerant identity from early 18th century Presbyterian ministers who refused to subscribe at their ordination to the [[Westminster Confession]], a standard [[Reformed]] ([[Calvinist]]) statement of faith; and who formed, in 1725, the [[Presbytery (church polity)|Presbytery]] of [[County Antrim|Antrim]]. A similar phenomenon led to the creation of the [[Remonstrant]] Synod of Ulster in 1830. The two bodies created the Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland (NSPCI) in 1910.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1926 &amp;quot;In 1910 the Antrim Presbytery, Remonstrant Synod and Synod of Munster were united as the General Synod of the non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland. They have 38 congregations and some mission stations.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The [[Synod of Munster]] became part of the NSPCI in 1935.

Many Non-subscribing Presbyterians keep close contact with the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|Unitarians]] and are sometimes identified as such, though they are distinct bodies. The Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland has associations with the [[IARF]] but not with the [[ICUU]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Erwin Fahlbusch &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The encyclopedia of Christianity&amp;apos;&amp;apos; v5 p605 - 2008 &amp;quot;Eventually the particular needs of the specific Unitarian and Universalist and Unitarian-Universalist IARF ... Thus, for example, the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland has associations with the [[IARF]] but not with the [[ICUU]] ...&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The IARF does not believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ: &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Unitarians believe that Jesus was a man, unequivocally human. It has long been our view that to talk of him as God is unfaithful to his own understanding of himself.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.unitarian.org.uk/intro/faq.shtml?9 Unitarian website, Retrieved 11 October 2012.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

Today, the denomination has thirty-one congregations in [[Northern Ireland]] and two congregations in the [[Republic of Ireland]], with a total of about four thousand members. They are served by fewer than twenty ministers; both women and men serve as ministers. The NSCPI is a member of the [[Irish Council of Churches]], the [[European Liberal Protestant Network]] and the [[International Association for Religious Freedom]].
