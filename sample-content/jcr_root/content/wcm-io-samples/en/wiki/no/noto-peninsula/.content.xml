==Name==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Noto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has no meaning in Japanese. It appears to come from [[Ainu languages|Ainu]], where &amp;apos;&amp;apos;not&amp;apos;&amp;apos; means &amp;quot;peninsula&amp;quot;; the final &amp;apos;&amp;apos;-o&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is presumably a [[Paragoge|paragogic]] [[echo vowel]], since the Japanese language does not allow final consonants.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Vovin, Alexander (2008). &amp;quot;Man&amp;apos;yōshū to Fudoki ni Mirareru Fushigina Kotoba to Jōdai Nihon Retto ni Okeru Ainugo no Bunpu.&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kokusai Nihon Bunka Kenkyū Sentā.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The two kanji that form the word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Noto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (能登) denote &amp;quot;skill / climbing&amp;quot;, but may be a case of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[ateji]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; that is, a kanji spelling constructed to spell a previously existing word, with little or no regard to the meaning of the kanji.
