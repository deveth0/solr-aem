&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Noah&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the name of species of [[ox]] called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[gaur]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[cloning|cloned]] and gestated in the [[womb]] of a [[cow]] named Bessie. Gaur is a vulnerable species according to the [[IUCN]]. The baby bull gaur was delivered on January 8, 2001, but died within just 48 hours of a common [[dysentery]] on January 10, 2001. Noah&amp;apos;s condition was monitored by Dr. Jonathan Hill and his teammates in Iowa. The process used to clone Noah was [[nuclear transfer]]. Researchers from Advanced Cell Technology (ACT) in [[Massachusetts]] said the problem was unlikely to be related to the cloning procedure itself.
