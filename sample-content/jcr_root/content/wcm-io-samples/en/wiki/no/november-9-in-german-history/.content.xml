        text="&lt;p&gt;[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 175-01448, Berlin, Reichskanzlei, Philipp Scheidemann.jpg|thumb|Berlin, 9 November 1918, [[Philipp Scheidemann]] proclaims the Republic.]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;9 November&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has been the date of several important events in [[German history]]. The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Schicksalstag&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Destiny day) has been occasionally used by historians and journalists since shortly after [[World War&amp;amp;nbsp;II]], but its current widespread use started with the events of 1989 when virtually all German media picked up the term.

There are five major events in German history that are connected to 9 November:

*1848: After being arrested in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Vienna revolts]], liberal leader [[Robert Blum]] is executed. The [[execution]] is often seen as a symbolic event for the ultimate failure of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]].

*1918: [[Monarchy]] in Germany ends when Kaiser [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm&amp;amp;nbsp;II]] is dethroned in the [[German Revolution|November Revolution]]. [[Philipp Scheidemann]] proclaims the [[Weimar Republic]] from a window of the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]]. Two hours later [[Karl Liebknecht]] proclaims a &amp;quot;Free Socialist Republic&amp;quot; from a balcony of the [[Berliner Stadtschloss]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Der 9. November&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (The Ninth of November) is the title of a novel by [[Bernhard Kellermann]] published in Germany that told the story of the German insurrection of 1918.

*1923: The [[Beer Hall Putsch]], from 8 to 9 November, marks the emergence of the [[Nazi Party]] as an important player on Germany&amp;apos;s political landscape.

*1938: In the [[Kristallnacht]], from 9 to 10 November, [[synagogue]]s and [[Jewish]] property are burned and destroyed on a large scale. More than 1,300 Jews are killed.

*1989: The [[Berlin Wall#The Fall|fall of the Berlin Wall]] ends German separation and starts a series of events that ultimately lead to the [[German reunification]] and the [[Fall of Communism]] in eastern Europe. November 9 was considered as the date for [[German Unity Day]], but as it was also the anniversary of Kristallnacht, this date was considered inappropriate as a national holiday. The date of the formal reunification of Germany, 3 October 1990, therefore, was chosen as the date for the holiday instead.

*The establishment of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] in 1925 is sometimes mentioned as having taken place on 9 November as well.
