The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Noble M12&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a two-door, two-seat [[sports car]] manufactured by [[Noble Automotive]].

== Description ==

Like the Noble M10, the Noble M12 is a two-door, two-seat model, originally planned both as a coupe and as a convertible. All M12s have been powered by modified bi-turbocharged Ford [[Duratec]] V6 engines. The M12 has a full steel roll cage, steel frame, and G.R.P. (fibreglass) composite clam shell body parts. These famed &amp;quot;Ferrari killers&amp;quot; are extremely lightweight and stiff. Although looking to be track derived, the M12 performs very well on both road and track, with surprisingly good ride quality, but a rigid feel. This is achieved by having no anti-roll bars on the car. This allows the suspension to be stiff yet comfortable.

The coupe evolved through four versions of Noble cars, with the M400 as the ultimate version of the M12, and is followed by the M12 GTO-3R. Only 220 Noble GTO-3Rs and M400s were imported to the U.S. They are the only Nobles available to the American market. The U.S. production rights to the M12s and M400s were sold in February 2007 to 1G Racing from Ohio. Due to high demand of these cars, 1G Racing (now Rossion Automotive) released its own improved car based on the M400, named [[Rossion Q1]]. Another company which is also producing a model developed from the M12 is Salica Cars 1 with their Salica GT and Salica GTR.

The only convertible variant (the M12 GTC) was shown at motor shows but was canceled, and was never produced by Noble. In 2008, Salica Cars proposed the Salica GTC, offered both as a complete car and a conversion kit to transform an M12/400 coupe into a convertible.
