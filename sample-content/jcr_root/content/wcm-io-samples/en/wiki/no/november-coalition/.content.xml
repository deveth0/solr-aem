The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;November Coalition&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a non-profit grassroots organization, founded in 1997, which fights against the [[War on Drugs]] and for the rights of the [[prison]]ers incarcerated as the effect of that war. It publishes a bulletin called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Razor Wire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Tyrone Brown==

The November Coalition was involved in the advocacy for [[Tyrone Brown]]&amp;apos;s release.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/465/tyrone_brown_life_in_prison_for_dirty_UA_campaign_to_free_him_grows  Feature: Clamor Grows for Freedom for Texas Marijuana Prisoner Tyrone Brown] Drug War Chronicle&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Brown, an [[African American]] Texan, has been sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].
