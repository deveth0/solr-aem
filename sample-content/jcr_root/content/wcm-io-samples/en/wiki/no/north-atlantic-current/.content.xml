The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;North Atlantic Current&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;North Atlantic Drift&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;North Atlantic Sea Movement&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a powerful warm [[ocean current]] that continues the [[Gulf Stream]] northeast. West of [[Continental Europe]] it splits into two major branches. One branch goes southeast, later to become the [[Canary Current]] as it passes northwest [[Africa]] and turns southwest. The other major branch continues north along the coast of [[northwestern Europe]]. It is thought to have a considerable warming influence on the [[climate]], although a minority have disputed this.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|author=R. SEAGER, D. S. BATTISTI, J. YIN, N. GORDON, N. NAIK, A. C. CLEMENT, and M. A. CANE|title=Is the Gulf Stream responsible for Europeâ€™s mild winters?|year=2002|publisher=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|accessdate=2010-10-25|url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/gs/pubs/Seager_etal_QJ_2002.pdf}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Other branches include the [[Irminger Current]] and the [[Norwegian Current]]. Driven by the global [[thermohaline circulation]] (THC), the North Atlantic Current is also often considered{{by whom|date=May 2011}} part of the wind-driven Gulf Stream which goes further east and north from the [[North America]]n coast, across the [[Atlantic]] and into the [[Arctic Ocean]].
