&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Northolt tube station&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a station on the [[London Underground]] [[Central line]] in [[Northolt]] in the [[London Borough of Ealing]]. It is in [[Travelcard Zone 5]] and between [[Greenford station|Greenford]] and [[South Ruislip station|South Ruislip]] stations.

==History==
The [[Great Western Railway]] constructed a halt at this location named Northolt Halt in 1907, which was on what was the [[New North Main Line]] to [[Birmingham]]. It was renamed Northolt (for West End) Halt, before gaining station status under its original shorter name. It was closed in 1948 when the Central line was extended on a new pair of tracks from [[North Acton]], the current Northolt tube station opening on 21 November 1948.&amp;lt;ref name=CULG&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/central.html#dates |title=Central Line, Dates |work=Clive&amp;apos;s Underground Line Guides |accessdate=11 October 2009 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The opening had been planned to be in [[New Works Programme|the 1930s]] but was delayed by the [[Second World War]].

==The station today==
The station has an island platform with passenger access down from the booking hall. Trains terminating at the station may use either a turnback siding west of the platforms to leave the running lines and run eastwards later or a crossover east of the station for more immediate return to central London.

North of the Central line tracks there is the singled track of the former GWR [[New North Main Line]] from Paddington which now is used by freight trains and a single daily passenger service (operated by [[Chiltern Railways]]) between Paddington and [[Gerrards Cross railway station|Gerrards Cross]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;chilterntimetable&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Timetable 11 December 2011 to 13 May 2012|url=http://www.chilternrailways.co.uk/sites/default/files/December%202011%20Timetable%20booklet.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2012|publisher=Chiltern Railways}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; There are no longer any platforms on this line.
