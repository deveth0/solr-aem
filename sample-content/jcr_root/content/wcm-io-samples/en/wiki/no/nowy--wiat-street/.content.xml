&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ulica Nowy Świat&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-pl|uˈlit͡sa ˈnɔvɨ ˈɕfjat}}, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;New World Street&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is one of the main historic [[thoroughfare]]s of [[Warsaw]].

It comprises part of the [[Royal Route, Warsaw|Royal Route]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Trakt królewski&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) that runs from Warsaw&amp;apos;s [[Royal Castle (Warsaw)|Royal Castle]] and [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]], south to King [[Jan III Sobieski]]&amp;apos;s 17th-century royal residence at [[Wilanów]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Warsaw-de_gaulle-roundabout.jpg|thumb|left|Charles de Gaulle Roundabout]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nowy Świat&amp;apos;&amp;apos; runs from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Plac Trzech Krzyży&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Three Crosses Square]]) northwards, intersecting  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Aleje Jerozolimskie]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Jerusalem Avenue) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[ulica Świętokrzyska]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Holy Cross Street). Near the [[Warsaw University]] campus and the [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] monument it changes into &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Krakowskie Przedmieście]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which then runs all the way to the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]].

At its southern end, at [[Triple Cross Square]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nowy Świat&amp;apos;&amp;apos; changes into the elegant &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Aleje Ujazdowskie]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Ujazdów Avenue), which changes into &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[ulica Belwederska]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Belweder]] Street), which becomes [[ulica Sobieskiego]] ([[Jan III Sobieski|Sobieski]] Street) as it continues coursing south, ultimately to arrive at [[Wilanów]].

==History==
[[Image:Nowy Swiat.jpg|thumb|Artist&#x60;s view, 1900]]
Until the 16th century, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nowy Świat&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a main road leading to numerous [[szlachta]] palaces and villages south of [[Warsaw]]. The street&amp;apos;s present name was coined in the 17th century, after the city had begun growing substantially (c.1640).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;warsawtour&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{pl icon}} {{cite web  |author = |url = http://www.warsawtour.pl/index.php?id=56&amp;amp;pid=1593121032 |title = Trakt Królewski  |work = www.warsawtour.pl |publisher =  |pages =  |page =  |date = |accessdate = 2008-09-19}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;spacery&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{pl icon}} {{cite web  |author = |url = http://spacery-po-warszawie.w.interia.pl/ns.html |title = Nowy Świat |work = |publisher =  |pages =  |page =  |date = |accessdate = 2008-09-19}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; By the turn of the 18th century, the fields along &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nowy Świat&amp;apos;&amp;apos; had become densely urbanized, mostly with wooden palaces and manors.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;warsawtour&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; [[Street gutter|Gutter]]s had been constructed, and the street itself was [[Pavement (roads)|paved]] with [[cobblestone]]s.

In the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic period]], [[Warsaw]] grew substantially and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nowy Świat&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was almost completely rebuilt.  Wooden manors gave way to stone and brick, mostly three-story, [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] buildings. By the end of the 19th century, the buildings had been expanded and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nowy Świat&amp;apos;&amp;apos; had become one of the principal business streets of [[Warsaw]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;spacery&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; It was also one of the more heavily trafficked streets, with  numerous shops and restaurants that attracted Varsovians as well as tourists. Larger new buildings replaced the earlier ones, and the character of the street changed. In the early 20th century, almost all trace of neoclassical architecture was lost as new buildings were erected mostly in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[art nouveau]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; style.

During the [[Warsaw Uprising]] (August-October 1944), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nowy Świat&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was almost completely destroyed.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;warsawtour&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; Barely any buildings survived. At war&amp;apos;s end, it was decided to rebuild &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nowy Świat&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. As restoring its prewar &amp;apos;&amp;apos;art nouveau&amp;apos;&amp;apos; state would have been prohibitive, it was reverted to its early-19th-century appearance.

Now, through the New World Street are locates some restaurants, coffee shops and other institutes.
