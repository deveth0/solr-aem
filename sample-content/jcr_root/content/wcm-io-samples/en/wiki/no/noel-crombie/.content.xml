&amp;lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:NoelCrombie.jpg|200px|thumb|Noel Crombie]] --&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Noel Crombie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Geoffrey Noel Crombie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on 17 April 1953) is a New Zealand singer and former member of the band [[Split Enz]]. He fulfilled multiple roles including costume and hair designer, percussionist, album cover designer, and music video director. Prior to Split Enz, Crombie worked as a postal assistant and was also an artist.

For the album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Time and Tide (Split Enz album)|Time and Tide]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Crombie took over the role of drummer, though a year later returned to percussion, with [[Paul Hester]] becoming Split Enz&amp;apos;s drummer.  He is particularly remembered for playing spoon solos during Split Enz live shows.

After Split Enz disbanded, Noel formed the band [[Schnell Fenster]] with [[Phil Judd]], [[Eddie Rayner]] and [[Nigel Griggs]], also Split Enz alumni, and [[Michael den Elzen]]. Rayner left before the first album was released.

In 1988 the members of Schnell Fenster collaborated with [[Wendy Matthews]], [[Michael Harris]],{{dn|date=July 2012}} Louis McMannus, Vika Bull and Lisa Edwards under the name &amp;apos;Noel&amp;apos;s Cowards&amp;apos; for the movie &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Rikky and Pete]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Crombie has released one solo single, &amp;quot;My Voice Keeps Changing on Me&amp;quot;, in 1983 while Split Enz took a break. [[Tim Finn]] was the only other band member to have a solo release during this break. According to Crombie he had to either release the single or pay for the studio time.

In 1996, Crombie assisted [[Crowded House]] by designing the stage set design for their final concert, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Farewell to the World]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; at the [[Sydney Opera House]].

Crombie currently lives with his daughters Hedwig, Griselda, his adopted daughters Sunday and Greer, and his wife Sally whom he works with as a freelance designer. They recently designed the set for [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]-TV&amp;apos;s musical quiz program &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/spicksandspecks/txt/s1530492.htm |title=Spicks and Specks&amp;amp;nbsp;â€” credit list |accessdate=10 August 2008 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
