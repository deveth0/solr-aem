&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;North Lake College&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[community college]] that is part of the [[Dallas County Community College District]] and is located in the [[Las Colinas]] area of [[Irving, Texas]] between MacArthur Boulevard and Walnut Hill Lane. The school opened in 1977 and features an enrollment of about 10,000 credit students and an additional 3,000 continuing education students. In 2012 a [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] train station opened on North Lake&amp;apos;s central campus, connecting it to downtown Dallas and [[Dallas Love Field]] on the Orange Line.

In 2005 the college purchased a {{convert|35.8|acre|m2|sing=on}} tract of land in [[Coppell, Texas]] as the site of a satellite campus, which opened in 2008 as North Lake College - North Campus. The North Campus location in far northwestern Dallas County allows it to pull students not only from Dallas County, but also from neighboring Tarrant County and Denton County. The North Campus is also home to the college&amp;apos;s logistics technology program.

North Lake College - South Campus was opened in fall 2009 and is located on the northeast corner of Shady Grove and MacArthur Boulevard in Irving, with the primary purpose of providing educational opportunities for those in need of basic academic skills, language acquisition, and job competencies in the under-served areas of South Irving.

The college&amp;apos;s specialties include logistics technology, sciences, and the arts, with plays and fine arts shows throughout the school year. North Lake&amp;apos;s monthly student newspaper, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;News-Register&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, has won multiple national awards for college publications.

North Lake College should not be confused with [[North Lakes State College]] in Queensland, Australia.

== Athletics ==
The North Lake College Blazers compete within the [[Metro Athletic Conference]], a National Junior College Athletic Association Division III non-scholarship conference. Sports at North Lake include men&amp;apos;s basketball, baseball, and women&amp;apos;s soccer.

On March 18, 2006 the North Lake College men&amp;apos;s basketball team defeated the [[Gloucester County College]] (located in [[Sewell, New Jersey]]) team to claim the 2006 National Junior College Athletic Association ([[NJCAA]]) Division III Championship.
