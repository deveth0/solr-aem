The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Northern Ireland Unionist Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (NIUP) was a small [[political party]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. It was formed in January 1999 as a splinter party from the [[UK Unionist Party]] (UKUP). This split was caused by disagreement between the five UKUP members of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]. Four of the members disagreed with UKUP leader [[Robert McCartney (Northern Irish politician)|Robert McCartney]]&amp;apos;s policy of resigning from the Assembly should [[Sinn FÃ©in]] become part of the power-sharing executive. [[Cedric Wilson]], [[Patrick Roche (politician)|Patrick Roche]], [[Norman Boyd]] and [[Roger Hutchinson]] disagreed with McCartney, wanting to remain in the Assembly to challenge unionists in favour of the [[Belfast Agreement]]. McCartney disciplined these members in their absence and, in response, they left the UKUP and formed the NIUP. Led by Wilson, the new party argued that it had the support of the grassroots membership of the UKUP, but McCartney disputed this.

Subsequently, Hutchinson left the NIUP on 30 November 1999, sitting as an independent Unionist for a period before joining the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP). He then left the DUP and unsuccessfully contested the [[Northern Ireland Assembly Election, 2003|2003 Assembly Election]] as an independent Unionist.

The NIUP opposed the Belfast Agreement and the reformation of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] to the [[Police Service Northern Ireland]]. They described their position as &amp;quot;principled unionism.&amp;quot;

In its first electoral test, the party polled very poorly in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 General Election]] and in local elections held on the same day, winning no Westminster or council seats. In the [[Northern Ireland Assembly Election, 2003|2003 Assembly Election]], the NIUP won no seats at all.

The NIUP consistently a low level of support and mainly contested the constituencies represented by its four Assembly members. In 2001, it received 1,794 votes in the general election and 1,818 votes in [[Northern Ireland local elections, 2001|the local elections]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/fw01.htm |title=The 2001 Westminster elections in Northern Ireland |accessdate=2008-06-21 |last=Whyte |first=Nicholas|date=2003-05-13 |work=[[Northern Ireland Social and Political Archive]]}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/flg01.htm |title=The 2001 Local Government Elections in Northern Ireland |accessdate=2008-06-21 |last=Whyte |first=Nicholas|date=2001-07-01 |work=[[Northern Ireland Social and Political Archive]]}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This fell to 1,350 in the 2003 Assembly election.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/fa03.htm |title=Northern Ireland Assembly Elections 2003 |accessdate=2008-06-21 |last=Whyte |first=Nicholas|date=2004-01-06 |work=[[Northern Ireland Social and Political Archive]]}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Its share of the vote across Northern Ireland was around 0.2% in each case.

The party&amp;apos;s submission of accounts for 2004 stated that the party was &amp;quot;inactive&amp;quot; during this period and there is no evidence of subsequent activity.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/files/dms/NorthernIrelandUnionistParty_17359-12786__E__N__S__W__.PDF |title=Northern Ireland Unionist Party Statement of Accounts; 1st January 2004 to 31st December 2004 |accessdate=2008-06-21 |last=Boyd |first=Norman |date=2005-03-26 |publisher=[[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]]|format=PDF}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Wilson stood as an [[independent (politician)|independent]] candidate in the [[Strangford (Assembly constituency)|Strangford]] constituency at the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2007|2007 Assembly Election]] where he polled 305 votes (0.8%), thus finishing last out of the fifteen candidates.

The NIUP voluntarily deregistered as a political party on 10 March 2008.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/63167/Renamed-or-Deregistered-Parties.pdf |title=Renamed or Deregistered Parties}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
