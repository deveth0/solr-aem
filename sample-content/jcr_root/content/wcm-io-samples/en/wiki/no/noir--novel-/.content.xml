&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Noir&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[science fiction]] [[novel]] by [[K. W. Jeter]], published in 1998.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[K. W. Jeter]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Noir&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1998, ISBN 0-553-10483-7&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It uses the [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] of [[film noir]] – the alienated, doomed hero, the [[cynical]] [[private detective]], the [[femme fatale]], universal corruption and moral breakdown – to portray a [[dystopian]] vision of [[capitalism]] run riot.

Even the [[monochrome]] visual style of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;film noir&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a factor in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Noir&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as the hero has had his eyes specially treated to show the world as a [[black-and-white]] movie, altering his perception of people and objects around him so they fit into the aesthetic. The hero is a detective named [[nihilism|McNihil]] who is hired by corporate executives ostensibly to investigate the death of one of their colleagues.

The book is set in the Pacific Fringe – the only remaining industrialised part of the world – in a society where [[free market]] [[capitalism]] holds absolute sway. Even the dead, including the hero&amp;apos;s wife, can be brought back to life as slave labour if they fail to meet their financial obligations. The [[internet]] has evolved radically so that [[emails]] can be seen fluttering around the recipient and pestering for attention, while strange online sexual experiences can be had through electronic surrogates called prowlers.
