The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;North Christian Church&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a church in [[Columbus, Indiana|Columbus]], [[Indiana]]. Founded in 1955, it is part of the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]].  The church building of 1964 was designed by Finnish-American architect [[Eero Saarinen]] (1910&amp;amp;ndash;1961) and completed in 1964. The church was the last building designed by Saarinen before his death.  Saarinen&amp;apos;s father [[Eliel Saarinen]] had designed the [[First Christian Church, Columbus, Indiana|First Christian Church]] in Columbus.

The building is [[hexagon]]al in shape, with a central metal [[spire]] which is {{convert|192|ft}} high.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xs4LAJdUqlUC&amp;amp;lpg=PA135&amp;amp;dq=%22anderson%20ferry%22&amp;amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22anderson%20ferry%22&amp;amp;f=false | title=Shifra Stein&amp;apos;s Day Trips from Cincinnati: Getaways Less Than Two Hours Away | publisher=Globe Pequot | date=Oct 1, 2003 | accessdate=2013-04-25 | author=Hunter, David | pages=16}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Below the spire, there is an [[oculus]] that admits light into the main level. The sanctuary is located at the center of the building, with the altar located in the center of the sanctuary. Rows of pews surround the altar in a hexagon, reflecting the idea that worship should be a central aspect of the life of the congregation. The lower level contains classrooms, an auditorium, a kitchen and an activities area.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nrhpinv3&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/00000705.pdf |title=National Historic Landmark Nomination: North Christian Church |author=Thayer, Laura |publisher=National Park Service}} and [http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Photos/00000705.pdf &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Accompanying five photos from 1999&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
