A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;non-restrictive clause&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a clause in which a noun phrase that is used to avoid repetition (as the [[referent]] of an [[anaphor]], meaning that it is substituted by another word but refers to the same noun) is determined by its [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] where the dependent is peripheral (non-essential) in the secondary constituent, as opposed to a [[restrictive clause]], where the dependent is central (essential) to its primary constituent. A non-restrictive clause does not identify the referent of its noun, but only provides information about it.

Restrictive example:

:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The officer helped the civilians who had been shot.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
or
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The officer helped those civilians who had been shot.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

In this example, there is no comma before &amp;quot;who.&amp;quot; Therefore, what follows is a restrictive clause. (Not all of the civilians had been shot.)

Non-restrictive example:
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The officer helped the civilians, who had been shot.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Here, there is a comma before &amp;quot;who.&amp;quot; Therefore, what follows is a non-restrictive clause. It changes the sentence to mean that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;all&amp;apos;&amp;apos; the civilians had been shot.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.unt.edu/cjus/resources/that-which.htm{{Dead link|date=December 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
