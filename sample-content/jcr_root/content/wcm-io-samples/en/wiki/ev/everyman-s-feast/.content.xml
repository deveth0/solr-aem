&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Everyman&amp;apos;s Feast&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jedermanns Fest&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a 2002 Austrian [[drama film]] written and directed by [[Fritz Lehner]]. It was entered into the [[24th Moscow International Film Festival]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Moscow2002&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2002 |title=24th Moscow International Film Festival (2002) |accessdate=2013-03-31 |work=MIFF}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Plot==
Jan Jedermann (played by [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]]) is an ingenious [[fashion designer]], but also an unscrupulous [[showman]]. He dies in a car accident and ruminates during his last hours about how one more night in his life could have gone by. He just cannot accept that Death comes to get him on the evening of his greatest triumph, a fashion show set on the roof of the [[Vienna]] [[Opera]]. He makes a pact with Death, allowing him to remain among the living at least until the morning.

At the end of the film, one realises how lonely Jan&amp;apos;s life is and how desolate and painful it is to fall from grace especially when there is no one there to help him to his feet again.
