The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Evangelical Baptist Mission of South Haiti&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mission Evangélique Baptiste du Sud-Haiti&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (MEBSH) grew out of the successful efforts of the non-denominational &amp;apos;&amp;apos;World Team&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cuba Bible Institute&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Workers deported from [[Cuba]] returned home to [[Haiti]] and began to spread the gospel they have found.

In 1936, 3 missionaries began to work among these Haitians who had been converted under [[Baptist]] ministry while they were working in Cuban sugar cane fields. In 1937, the mission opened a Bible school in [[Les Cayes]]. MEBSH now also operates a seminary, a hospital, and Radio Lumière (a network of 9 radio stations, including a radio station, studio &amp;amp; television station in [[Port-au-Prince]]). In 1995, the MEBSH had 183 churches with over 60,000 members (although &amp;apos;&amp;apos;World Team&amp;apos;&amp;apos; currently estimates as many as 115,000).

Since 2006 the Evangelical Baptist Mission of South Haiti has taken a new direction towards progress under the leadership of the Rev. Pastor Luderse Erase. His vision for the mission goes beyond preaching the gospel alone, but also to enhance and improve the system by incorporating different eco-social aspects with a large range of activities that will gear the mission towards a new biblical and social approach.
