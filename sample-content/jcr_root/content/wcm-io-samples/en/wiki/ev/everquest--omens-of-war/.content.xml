&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;EverQuest: Omens of War&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, often abbreviated as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;OOW&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Omens&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is the eighth [[expansion pack|expansion]] released for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[EverQuest]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG). The expansion focused on high-level content and introduced new [[folklore]] to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;EverQuest&amp;apos;&amp;apos; universe, and was often humorously referred to as &amp;apos;Omens of [[World of Warcraft|Warcraft]]&amp;apos; by the player base at the time.

This expansion:

* Added five more levels, increasing the cap to 70
* Introduced new Epic weapons, known as Epic 2.0
* A new Tribute system, allowing guilds to pool tribute points to purchase various effects
* A &amp;quot;task system&amp;quot;, intended to &amp;quot;allow players to have quick solo content while waiting for a group to form&amp;quot;.
* An expansion of the character Title system, allowing players to choose which available title their character could have, as well as adding a great many more, including tradeskill titles like Expert Chef
* A ninth spell slot, which could be earned via AA purchase
* A voice macro system, intended to allow players to make audible comments to each other.

==Zones==
*Dranik&amp;apos;s Scar
*Harbingers&amp;apos; Spire
*Muramite Proving Grounds
*Nobles&amp;apos; Causeway
*Riftseekers&amp;apos; Sanctum
*The Bloodfields
*The Ruined City of Dranik
*Wall of Slaughter

===Instanced Zones===
*Catacombs of Dranik
*Citadel of Anguish
*Dranik&amp;apos;s Hollows
*Innoruuk&amp;apos;s Realm
*Muramite Proving Grounds Trials - 6 group, 6 raid
*Sewers of Dranik

The expansion&amp;apos;s final zone, Citadel of Anguish, gained particular notoriety among players who raided in the game as a result of the Overlord Mata Muram encounter. Widely considered the most difficult raid boss relative to its time in any MMO, the encounter had a unique mechanic which would target a random member of the entire raid and require a specific action take place within a few seconds of the emote or else the raid would be completely wiped out. While the mechanic is now commonplace today, during its time the boss was widely considered &amp;quot;impossible,&amp;quot; to beat until Cestus Dei on the Veeshan server conquered it on March 23, 2005. It would be months before another guild in the game would defeat the encounter.
