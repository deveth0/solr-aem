        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Celia Larkin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a former [[civil service of the Republic of Ireland|Irish civil servant]] and was the partner of then Irish [[Taoiseach]] (prime minister) [[Bertie Ahern]].

==Relationship with Bertie Ahern==
Their relationship ended in April 2003. Ahern is separated, though not divorced, from his wife. There was some controversy in the media at Ahern&amp;apos;s public presentation of his partner. No other European Heads of Government have similarly presented their partner at official engagements. Ahern was accused of hypocrisy in being associated with a woman other than his wife while being a practising Massgoer. The media discovered the couple had broken up when Larkin failed to co-host a diplomatic dinner for the visiting German [[President of Germany|Bundespräsident]], although her name, along with that of the Taoiseach, was featured on the invitations. Various media reports &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Irish Independent, 28th Aug 05 [http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=45&amp;amp;si=1458457&amp;amp;issue_id=12928]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; have suggested that Ahern has, since 2005, been in a relationship with his long time friend [[Anna Bogle]].

Larkin, during the period of her relationship with Ahern, regularly acted as his consort. She also occasionally engaged in civic functions in a private capacity. For example, she launched a high speed ferry, the [[M.V. Jonathan Swift]] for [[Irish Ferries]].

==Other activities==
Since parting with Ahern, she has expanded her chain of [[beauty salon]]s, and has appeared on [[Reality Television]], in an [[RTÉ]] show &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Restaurant&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a more serene forerunner to the [[ITV]] series [[Hell&amp;apos;s Kitchen (UK TV series)|Hell&amp;apos;s Kitchen]].

In July 2005, Ms. Larkin was appointed to the board of the new National Consumer Agency, a Government funded [[consumer watchdog]]. Her appointment was reportedly made at Bertie Ahern&amp;apos;s request.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Irish Independent, 20th Jul 05 [http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&amp;amp;si=1435953&amp;amp;issue_id=12759]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

As of 2010, she is attending the [[University of Limerick]] as a mature student.
