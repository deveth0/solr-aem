[[File:Castromao, Celanova, Galiza 12.jpg|thumb|250px|Castromao, in Celanova.]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Celanova&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] and [[municipality]] located in the [[province of Ourense]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Northern [[Spain]]. Situated near the border with [[Portugal]], the village is bordered by [[Ramirás]], [[Cartelle]], [[A Merca]], [[A Bola, Ourense|A Bola]], [[Verea]] and [[Quintela de Leirado]].

The Arnoia river crosses the southern limits of the township. The municipality has 6,020 inhabitants. The provincial capital [[Ourense]] is located 23&amp;amp;nbsp;km away on [[highway]] N-540 (Ourense to Portugal via Lindoso).

The [[Monastery of San Salvador de Celanova]] is the most important building in a well-preserved historical center. It was founded by [[St. Rudesind]] (San Rosendo) in 936. The nave is considered the most perfect Galician [[Baroque]] church. In the [[garden]] of the monastery can be found the [[pre-Romanesque art and architecture|pre-Romanesque]] chapel of San Miguel, one of the oldest in Spain.

The town preserves ancient streets, with several houses that display coats of arms. One of these [[mansion]]s was the birthplace of the great poet of the Galician Rexurdimento (Rebirth), [[Manuel Curros Enríquez]].

Nearby can be found the [[hill fort|castro]] (pre-Roman citadel) of Castromao. The visitor can still see the circular [[dwelling]]s and defensive walls built by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

A few kilometres from the town lies the village of Vilanova dos Infantes with a medieval tower from the 14th century. It belonged to the Counts of Monterrey. Close to this perfectly restored village is the sanctuary of La Virgen del Cristal, in which can be seen a strange transparent stone, perhaps a [[meteorite]], containing what some believe to be the image of the [[Virgin Mary]].
