&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;RFA &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Salvestor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (A499)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;King Salvor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class salvage vessel of the post war [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Salvestor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was built by Wm. Simons &amp;amp; Co. Ltd. of [[Renfrew]], [[Scotland]]. Laid down on 20 September 1941 as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Assistance&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and launched on 28 August 1942 as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Salvestor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
The ship was decommissioned in September 1959, laid up at [[Pembroke Dock]], and sold for breaking up to Thomas Ward at [[Briton Ferry]] in July 1970.

==Service history==
During the [[World War II|Second World War]] the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Salvestor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was one of two [[Royal Navy]] ships manned by [[South African Navy|South African Naval]] personnel (SANF). She remained the property of the Royal Navy, but was under SANF control from 31 August 1944. She served in the Mediterranean and then participated in the war against [[Japan]] with the [[British Eastern Fleet]].

In 1945 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Salvestor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; assisted a merchant ship that had encountered problems more than 200 km from [[Battle of Milne Bay|Milne Bay]], [[New Guinea]]. After the war &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Salvestor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; salvaged a number of wrecks from [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong Harbour]], including a Japanese tug. The SANF crew was gradually replaced by Royal Navy personnel, she was handed back to the Royal Navy in 1946.

For services rendered in the war against Japan, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Salvestor&amp;apos;&amp;apos; received the &amp;quot;Pacific 1942-45&amp;quot; [[battle honour]], the only South African-manned naval vessel to be honoured in this way.
