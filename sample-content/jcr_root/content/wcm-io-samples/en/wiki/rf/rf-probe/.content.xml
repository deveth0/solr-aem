        text="&lt;p&gt;An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;RF probe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a device which allows [[electronic test equipment]] to measure [[radio frequency]] [[oscillation]] (RF) in an [[electronic circuit]].

RF energy may be challenging to measure for one or more reasons, depending on the nature of the circuit to be measured and the measuring equipment at hand.

The first kind of difficulty arises when the RF energy to be measured is at a [[frequency]] too high for available test equipment, such as a low-bandwidth [[oscilloscope]], to process directly. In that case, the RF has to be converted to a DC or near-DC signal.

In this situation, a simple probe type sometimes called an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;RF detector&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; can be used to convert the RF signal to DC. Such device will work as a RF [[rectifier]] and give a pulsed [[Direct current|DC]] [[volt]]age.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.instructables.com/id/RF-probe/Instructables, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;RF Probe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The second kind of difficulty arises when RF energy has to be measured in a circuit which is sensitive to small changes in its electrical environment. For example, with some [[oscillator]] circuits, the presence of an ordinary wire within a few centimeters of the active components may change the amplitude or frequency of oscillations, or even prevent the circuit from oscillating at all. In that case, the signal has to be acquired by a measurement probe which extracts very little energy from the circuit. This can be achieved by employing very thin conductors, or tiny coils kept at some minimum separation from the active elements of the circuit.

In that situation, where circuit loading rather than high frequency is the real problem, a variety of small-geometry, [[high impedance]] probes can be used, sometimes including an [[amplifier]] to boost the tiny amount of energy extracted from the circuit to a level that allows it to be measured by available high-frequency test equipment.
