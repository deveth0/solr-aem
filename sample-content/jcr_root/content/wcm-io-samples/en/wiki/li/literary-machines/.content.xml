&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Literary Machines&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (short title) is a book first published in 1980 by [[Ted Nelson]], and republished 9 times by 1993. It offers an extensive overview of Nelson&amp;apos;s term &amp;quot;[[hypertext]]&amp;quot; as well as Nelson&amp;apos;s [[Project Xanadu]]. It also includes other theories by Nelson, including &amp;quot;[[Tumbler_(Project_Xanadu)|tumblers]]&amp;quot; for addressing bits in files past and present, &amp;quot;[[transclusion]]&amp;quot; as a method for including original work in one&amp;apos;s own work, and &amp;quot;[[micropayment]]s&amp;quot; to pay for the use. The format of the book is nonlinear, as the chapters are arranged in such a way that the text can be read out of order.
