In [[phonetics]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;liquids&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;liquid consonants&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are a class of [[consonant]]s consisting of [[lateral consonant]]s together with [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]]s.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;lm182&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Ladefoged and Maddieson (1996), p. 182&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Distribution==
Liquids as a class often behave in a similar way in the [[phonotactics]] of a language: for example, they often have the greatest freedom in occurring in [[consonant cluster]]s.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;lm182&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  In some languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]], there is one liquid phoneme which may have both lateral and rhotic [[allophone]]s.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;lm182&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

[[English language|English]] has two liquid phonemes, one lateral, {{IPAslink|l}} and one rhotic, {{IPAslink|ɹ}}, exemplified in the words &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;l&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ed&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;r&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ed&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Many other European languages have one lateral and one rhotic phoneme.  Some, such as [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]], have more than two liquid phonemes. These three languages have the set {{IPA|/l/ /ʎ/ /r/}}, with two laterals and one rhotic.  Similarly, the [[Iberian languages]] contrast four liquid phonemes.  {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/ʎ/}}, {{IPA|/ɾ/}}, and a fourth phoneme that is an [[alveolar trill]] in all but [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], where it is a [[guttural r|guttural]] trill or fricative.  Some European languages, like [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Irish language|Irish]], contrast a [[palatalization|palatalized]] lateral–rhotic pair with an unpalatalized (or [[velarization|velarized]]) set (e.g. {{IPA|/lʲ/ /rʲ/ /l/ /r/}} in Russian).

Elsewhere in the world, two liquids of the types mentioned above remains the most common attribute of a language&amp;apos;s consonant inventory, except in North America and [[indigenous Australian languages|Australia]]. In North America, a majority of languages do not have rhotics at all and there is a wide variety of [[lateral consonant|lateral sounds]] &amp;amp;ndash; though most are [[obstruent]] laterals rather than liquids. Most indigenous Australian languages are very rich in liquids, with some having as many as seven distinct liquids. These typically include dental, alveolar, retroflex and palatal laterals, and as many as three rhotics.

On the other side, there are many indigenous languages in the [[Amazon Basin]] and eastern North America, as well as a few in Asia and Africa, with no liquids. Polynesian languages typically have only one liquid, which may be either a lateral or a rhotic.

==Etymology==
The grammarian [[Dionysius Thrax]] used the Greek word ὑγρος (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hygros&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;moist&amp;quot;) to describe the {{IPA|/l,r,m,n/}} [[phoneme]]s of [[classical Greek]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;allen&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book

}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Most commentators assume that this referred to their &amp;quot;slippery&amp;quot; effect on [[meter (poetry)|meter]] in classical Greek verse when they occur as the second member of a consonant cluster.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;allen&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  This word was [[calque]]d into [[Latin]] as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;liquidus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, whence it has been retained in the Western European phonetic tradition.
