&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Liberal Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-hr|Liberalna stranka}} or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;LS&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was a [[Croatia]]n political party active between January 1998 and April 2006.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;hidra-profil&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; During its existence the party ran in two general elections (in 2000 and 2003) and in each election won two seats in the 151-seat [[Croatian parliament|Sabor]]. LS was a member of [[Liberal International]] and the [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party]]. Its last leader was Zlatko Benašić.

The party was formed in January 1998 following a party split in November 1997 when a faction led by [[Vlado Gotovac]], then chairman of [[Croatian Social Liberal Party]] (HSLS), left the party because of internal power struggles which resulted in former chairman [[Dražen Budiša]] taking back control of the party.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;slobodna&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.com/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/88158/Default.aspx|title=HDZ nastao, a HSLS skoro nestao u raskolu |last=Marjanović|first=Vedran|coauthors=Luetić, Tomislav|date=18 January 2010|work=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Gotovac was joined by other prominent liberals such as [[Osijek]] mayor [[Zlatko Kramarić]] and historian [[Ivo Banac]].

In 2000, the party had two representatives in the [[Croatian Parliament|Parliament]] and had one minister in a coalition government with the much larger [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]].

LS confirmed their two representatives in the Parliament in the 2003 elections, in an alliance with the social democrats, but became part of the opposition.

After the 2003 election party leader [[Ivo Banac]] announced the merger of LS with the [[Croatian People&amp;apos;s Party]] and [[LIBRA]] into one big liberal party, but this initiative was opposed by faction led by [[Zlatko Kramarić]]. Banac was replaced at the party convention.

After the 2005 local elections Zlatko Kramarić started merger negotiations with the [[Croatian Social Liberal Party]]. That prompted a group of dissidents in [[Split (city)|Split]] to form a new party called [[Dalmatian Liberal Party]].

Liberal Party formally ceased to exist with all of its membership and party infrastructure re-joining HSLS in April 2006.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;hidra-profil&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hidra.hr/politicke_stranke/imenik_stranaka_registriranih_u_rh_od_1990_godine/%28iframesrc%29/aHR0cDovL2hpZHJhLnNyY2UuaHIvd2VicGFjLWhpZHJhLXRoczIvP3JtPXJlc3VsdHMmYW1wO3Nob3dfZnVsbD0xJmFtcDtmPUlEdGhzJmFtcDt2PTAzMjg2MA==|title=Liberalna stranka|date=18 October 2011|publisher=HIDRA|language=Croatian|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
