&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Little Marvel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[United Kingdom]] [[record label]] which issued small (5Â½ - 6&amp;amp;nbsp;inch) [[gramophone record]]s during the 1920s. The label was owned by the [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]] record company.

As with many records of this type, the [[recording artist]]s are not credited. The labels on the records mention only the song title, the style of music (e.g. [[Foxtrot (dance)|foxtrot]], [[waltz]]), and in some cases the name of the [[songwriter]] or [[composer]].

Little Marvel records were sold exclusively at UK [[Woolworths Group plc|Woolworth&amp;apos;s]] chain stores from [[1921 in music|1921]] to [[1928 in music|1928]], at a retail price of 6d (sixpence).
