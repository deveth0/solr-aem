The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Living Waters Christian Assembly&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Pentecostal]] [[Church (building)|church]], serving the West End of [[Ottawa, Ontario]]. Until November 2004 it was named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Westend Church&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Started in approximately 1995 by The Life Centre, the Westend Church moved from a renovated warehouse on Woodward Drive in [[Carlington]], to the Fisher Park High School auditorium in [[Ottawa West]], finally to their own building on Slack Road near Merivale Rd.

The church also presents an annual Easter drama, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Crucifixion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which has been performed every year since 1985.
