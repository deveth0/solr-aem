        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lipolysis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-en|l|ɨ|ˈ|p|ɒ|l|ɨ|s|ɪ|s}} is the breakdown of [[lipid]]s and involves hydrolysis of [[triglycerides]] into free fatty acids, followed by degradation into acetyl units by [[beta oxidation]].  It produces [[ketone bodies|ketones]], which when produced in large quantities are described as causing [[ketosis]]. These can then be used by the body for energy.  Lipolysis testing strips are used to detect ketosis, primarily in [[diabetes mellitus|diabetic ketoacidosis]].

The following hormones induce lipolysis: [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]], [[ghrelin]], [[growth hormone]], [[testosterone]], and [[cortisol]] (In which cortisol assist in releasing body fat and carbohydrates for a source of energy) These trigger [[7TM receptor]]s (G protein-coupled receptors), which activate [[adenylate cyclase]]. This results in increased production of [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]], which activates [[CAMP-dependent protein kinase|protein kinase A]], which subsequently activates [[lipase]]s found in [[adipose tissue]].

Triglycerides are transported through the blood to appropriate tissues ([[adipose]], [[muscle]], etc.) by [[lipoprotein]]s such as [[VLDL]] (Very-Low-Density-Lipoproteins). Triglycerides present on the VLDL undergo lipolysis by the cellular lipases of target tissues, which yields [[glycerol]] and free [[fatty acid]]s.  Free fatty acids released into the blood are then available for cellular uptake.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/fatty-acid-oxidation.html|title=Oxidation of Fatty Acids|accessdate=9 April 2012|author=Michael W King, PhD|publisher=themedicalbiochemistrypage.org, LLC}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Free fatty acids not immediately taken up by cells may bind to [[Serum albumin|albumin]] for transport to surrounding tissues that require energy. Serum albumin is the major carrier of free fatty acids in the blood.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Tom Brody, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nutritional Biochemistry&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (Academic Press, 2nd edition 1999), 215-216. [[ISBN]] 0121348369&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The glycerol also enters the bloodstream and is absorbed by the [[liver]] or [[kidney]] where it is converted to [[glycerol 3-phosphate]] by the enzyme [[glycerol kinase]]. Hepatic glycerol 3-phosphate is converted mostly into [[dihydroxyacetonephosphate]] (DHAP) and then [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]] (GA3P) to rejoin the [[glycolysis]] and [[gluconeogenesis]] pathway.

While lipolysis is triglyceride [[hydrolysis]] (the process by which triglycerides are broken down), [[esterification]] is the process by which triglycerides are formed. Esterification and lipolysis are, in essence, reversals of one another.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;isbn0-07-255642-0&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |author=Baldwin, Kenneth David Sutherland; Brooks, George H.; Fahey, Thomas D. |title=Exercise physiology: human bioenergetics and its applications |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-07-255642-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
