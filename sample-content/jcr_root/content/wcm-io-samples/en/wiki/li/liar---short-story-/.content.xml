&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Liar!&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; is a [[science fiction]] [[short story]] by American writer [[Isaac Asimov]]. It first appeared in the May 1941 issue of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Astounding Science Fiction]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and was reprinted in the collections &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[I, Robot]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1950) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Complete Robot]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1982).  It was Asimov&amp;apos;s third published [[positronic robot]] story. Although the word &amp;quot;robot&amp;quot; was introduced to the public by Czech writer [[Karel ÄŒapek]] in his 1920 play [[R.U.R.]] (Rossum&amp;apos;s Universal Robots), Asimov&amp;apos;s story &amp;quot;Liar!&amp;quot; contains the first recorded use of the word &amp;quot;[[robotics]]&amp;quot; according to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Oxford English Dictionary]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  In 1969 &amp;quot;Liar&amp;quot; was adapted into an episode of the British television series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Out of the Unknown]],&amp;apos;&amp;apos; although only a few short clips of this episode are [[List of Out of the Unknown episodes|known to exist]]. The events of this short story are also mentioned in the story &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Robots of Dawn]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; written by the same author.

==Plot summary==
Through a fault in manufacturing, a [[robot]], RB-34 (a.k.a. Herbie), is created that possesses telepathic abilities. While the roboticists at [[U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men]] investigate how this occurred, the robot tells them what other people are thinking. But the [[Three Laws of Robotics|First Law]] still applies to this robot, and so it deliberately lies when necessary to avoid hurting their feelings and to make people happy, especially in terms of romance.

However, by lying, it is hurting them anyway. When it is confronted with this fact by [[Susan Calvin]] (to whom it told a lie that was particularly painful to her when it was shown to be false), the robot experiences an irresolvable logical conflict and becomes catatonic.
