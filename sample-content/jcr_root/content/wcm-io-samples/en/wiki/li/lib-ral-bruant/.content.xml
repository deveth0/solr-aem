&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Libéral Bruant&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ca&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1635 -  Paris, 22 November 1697), was a [[France|French]] [[architect]] best known as the designer of the [[Invalides|Hôtel des Invalides]], Paris, now dominated by the dome erected by [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]], his collaborator in earlier stages of the construction. A comparison of Bruant&amp;apos;s central entrance to the Invalides, under an arched cornice packed with military trophies with Mansart&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eglise du Dome&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (see [[Les Invalides]]), gives a clear idea of the difference between Bruant&amp;apos;s High Baroque and Hardouin-Mansart&amp;apos;s restrained and somewhat academic Late Baroque.

Libéral Bruant was the most notable in a family that produced a long series of architects active from the 16th to the eighteenth century.

In 1660, Libéral Bruant was the architect chosen for rehabilitations to Louis XIII&amp;apos;s old arsenal (the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Salpêtrière&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), which was being converted into a combination workhouse and orphanage. It is now the [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital]].

In the [[Le Marais|Marais]] district of Paris, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;hotel particulier&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Bruant built for himself in 1685, at rue de la Perle no.1 now houses the Bricard lock museum ([[Musée de la Serrure]]). Its Baroque facade of golden limestone is enlivened by windows set into blind arches that march across its front and busts in oval reserves, all under a richly-sculptured pediment that is pierced by an oval window.
