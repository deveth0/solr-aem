&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Literary Kicks&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[website]] that functions as a [[digital library]] of [[poetry]] and [[prose]], [[biography]] and cultural criticism chiefly focused on [[Beat Generation]] writers. Founded in 1994 by [[Levi Asher]], the site has since expanded to cover a wider range of literary genres, from ancient literature to contemporary fiction and poetry, and hosts literary discussions, poetry boards, workshops and a digital library of articles, resources and texts.

Since 1996 Literary Kicks has hosted poetry readings in [[New York City]] and other venues across the [[United States]]. In 1998 LitKicks Publishing was created. The first LitKicks publication was a digital video, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Notes from Underground&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, based on [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]&amp;apos;s [[Notes from Underground|story of the same name]], followed by a community-generated poetry anthology in 2004, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Action Poetry&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was nominated for a [[Blooker Prize]]. Other notable events include: The QUEST writing tournament (October 2003), the 24 Hour Poetry Party (July 2004) and October Earth (October 2004).
