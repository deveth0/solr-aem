The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Libertarian Movement Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Partido Movimiento Libertario&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;PML&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a political party based on [[classical liberalism]] in [[Costa Rica]].

It was founded in May 1994 and has since enjoyed a number of victories. It succeeded in getting attorney [[Otto Guevara]] elected to the  [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica|Legislative Assembly]] in its first campaign in 1998. In 2002, Guevara ran for president (unsuccessfully, 1.7% of the vote), and the party at the [[Costa Rican  parliamentary election, 2006|legislative elections]] won 9.3% of the popular vote and 6 out of 57 seats. A few weeks after taking office, one Congressman left the party and became independent, leaving PML with five seats. In 2006, Guevara again [[Costa Rican  presidential election, 2006|ran for president]] (unsuccessfully, 8.4% of the vote), and the party at the legislative elections won 9.1% of the popular vote and 6 out of 57 seats.

==Controversies==
{{Citation   needed|date=March 2010}}
In 2005, a dispute erupted between moderates and radicals within the party that led to the ouster of some of the more radical members. Despite this setback, PML continued to track along a course of “practical libertarianism” that seeks to bridge the gap between ideology and politics. Guevara said his party was now liberal and not libertarian.
