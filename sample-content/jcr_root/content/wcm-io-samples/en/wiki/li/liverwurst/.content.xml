The word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;liverwurst&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an anglicization of [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Leberwurst&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}, meaning &amp;quot;[[liver (food)|liver]] sausage&amp;quot;.  It is a [[sausage]] eaten in large parts of Europe, including [[Poland]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Serbia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Finland]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and [[Romania]] (especially in [[Transylvania]]).

Most liverwurst varieties are spreadable.  Liverwurst usually contains pigs&amp;apos; or calves&amp;apos; livers. Other ingredients are meat (notably veal), fat, and spices including ground [[black pepper]], [[marjoram]], [[allspice]], [[thyme]], ground [[mustard seed]], or [[nutmeg]]. Many regions in Germany have distinct recipes for liverwurst. Adding ingredients like pieces of [[onion]] or [[bacon]] to the recipe make each variety of liverwurst very important to cultural identity. For example, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Thüringer Leberwurst]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has a [[Protected Geographical Status]] throughout the EU. Recently, more exotic additions such as [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|cowberries]] and [[mushroom]]s have gained popularity.

=== Germany ===
Another German variety, especially in the [[Rhineland]] region, is pan-fried liverwurst that is served with large amounts of fried onions, and a chunky mixture of mashed apples and potatoes. Dishes, like this one served in the Rhineland region, that have mixtures of spicy and sweet flavors are regionally common.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

=== Hungary ===
In Hungary, liverwurst is customarily served on [[open sandwich]]es, or with cheese as a filling for pancakes which are baked in the oven.

=== Romania ===
In [[Romania]] Liverwurst is called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lebar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{fr}}{{Cite web|url=http://www.bucarest-hebdo.ro/index.php?page=detalii&amp;amp;categorie=special&amp;amp;id=20101222-397|title=Bon appétit !
