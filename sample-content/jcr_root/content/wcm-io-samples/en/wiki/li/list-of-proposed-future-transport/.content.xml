Most [[transport]] media in use today are generally fossil fuel powered. The reason for this is the ease of use and the existence of mature technologies harnessing this fuel source. Fossil fuels represent a concentrated, relatively compact source of energy. The drawbacks of such transportation media are that they are heavily polluting, and rely on limited energy sources.
Many ideas exist which try to either harness renewable forms of energy, more efficiently use fossil fuel, or use human power, or some hybrid of these, to move people and things.

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;list below contains some [[Mode of transport|forms of transport]] not in general use, but considered as possibilities in the future.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
