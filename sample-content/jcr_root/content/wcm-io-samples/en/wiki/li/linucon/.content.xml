&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Linucon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a combination [[Linux]] expo/[[science fiction]] convention in Austin, Texas. Conceived as a &amp;quot;sister convention&amp;quot; to [[Penguicon]], Linucon was co-founded by Rob Landley and Stu Green.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;lc&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Barr |publisher=Linux.com |title=Austin hosts the inaugural Linucon |url=http://www.linux.com/feature/39449 |date=October 7, 2004}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Two Linucons were held. The first Linucon was held October 8–10, 2004, at the Red Lion Inn located at 6121 North I-35 in Austin.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |work=Linux Online |title=Linucon 2004 |url=http://www.linux.org/event/2004/10/08/0001.html |date=October 8, 2004}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Linucon 2.0 was held September 30 – October 2, 2005, at the Ambassador Hotel located at the intersection of I-35 and Highway 183.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |publisher=flickr |title=Linucon 2.0: Sep-Oct 2005, Austin, TX |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/elzes/sets/72157594462078023/}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The science fiction side had three main tracks: an anime track, a literary track, and a gaming track.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;dt&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news |first=Kristi |last=Hsu |work=The Daily Texan |title=Furthing Linux&amp;apos;s Life |url=http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2004/10/11/Focus/Furthing.Linuxs.Life-748870.shtml |date=October 11, 2004}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; These tracks included [[cosplay]] (and a [[Masquerade ball|Masquerade]]), [[filk]], a dealer&amp;apos;s room, panels, author readings and signings, [[Birds of a Feather (computing)|Birds of a Feather]] sessions, and an art show. The convention suite featured caffeinated [[Jello]] and [[ice cream]] made with [[liquid nitrogen]]. There was also a [[live action role-playing game]]. The video room played around the clock and both gaming rooms (computer and paper) were open 24 hours.

The technical side ranged over such subjects as [[Linux kernel architecture]], [[security]] and [[network administration]], [[web design]], use of Linux on a laptop, [[computer gaming]], [[digital art]], [[electronic publishing]], and [[machinima]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;dt&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Free wireless internet access was available. There were panels, tutorials, an &amp;quot;installfest&amp;quot; and featured guests who went head to head in a first person shooter elimination tournament (the &amp;quot;celebrity fragfest&amp;quot;).

Notable guests included actor [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Jay Maynard|Jay &amp;quot;Tron Guy&amp;quot; Maynard]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |title=Love &amp;apos;Tron&amp;apos;?

Raymond]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;lc&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Aftermath==
Financial difficulties and the departure of primary founder [[Rob Landley]] from Austin led to the shutdown of Linucon after the second event.
