&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lionel George Curtis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1872&amp;amp;ndash;1955) was a British official and author. He advocated [[Imperial Federation|British Empire Federalism]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |author=Fromkin, David |title=A Peace to end all Peace |year=1989|page=232}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  and, late in life, a [[world state]].  His ideas concerning [[dyarchy]] were important in the development of the [[Government of India Act 1919]] and more generally, his writings influenced the evolution of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

==Life==

Curtis was born at [[Coddington, Herefordshire]] in 1872, the youngest of the four children of an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[rector (ecclesiastical)#Anglican churches|rector]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Tom Cargill: How to build a better world. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;History Today&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Vol. 63, No. 2 (February 2013).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was educated at [[Haileybury College]] and then at [[New College, Oxford]], where he read law. He fought in the [[Second Boer War]] with the [[City Imperial Volunteers]] and served as secretary to [[Lord Milner]] (a position that had also been held by adventure-novelist [[John Buchan]]), during which time he dedicated himself to working for a united self-governing South Africa. Following Milner&amp;apos;s death in 1925, he became the second leader of [[Milner&amp;apos;s Kindergarten]] until his own death in 1955. His experience led him to conceptualize his version of a [[Federal World Government]], which became his life work. In pursuit of this goal, he founded (1910) the quarterly &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Round Table Journal|Round Table]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  He was appointed (1912) Beit lecturer in colonial history at the [[University of Oxford]], and a Fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]].

In 1919 Curtis led a delegation of British and American experts to organize the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]] during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace Conference of Paris]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Edgar Trevor Williams, A. F. Madden, David Kenneth Fieldhouse. Oxford and the Idea of Commonwealth. Routledge, 1982. (Pages 39, 98)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Works==

Curtis&amp;apos; most important books were:

* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Commonwealth of Nations&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1916);
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dyarchy&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1920); and,
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Civitas Dei: The Commonwealth of God&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1938), arguing that the [[United States]] must rejoin the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British commonwealth]] and that the Commonwealth must evolve into a [[world government]].
