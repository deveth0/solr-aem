==Notes==
&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;a&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;Was unable to enter the Northwest Territories, but returned to Ottawa, and campaigned against Manitoba becoming a province. He was listed as leader of the provisional Northwest Territories government until [[Adams G. Archibald]] took over on May 10, 1870.

Since the establishment of [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Alberta]] from the Territories&amp;apos; most populated regions, the Territories have had no [[lieutenant-governor]]. Instead, a [[Commissioners of Northwest Territories|commissioner]] represents the federal government and acts as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;de facto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; representative of [[Canadian monarchy|the Queen]]. [[Yukon]] was carved out of the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1898 and has had its [[Commissioners of Yukon|own commissioners]] since then.
