        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Limpinwood Nature Reserve&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a wilderness region of 26 kmÂ² situated in the Border ranges of north eastern [[New South Wales]] in [[Australia]].

The reserve is part of the Shield Volcano Group of the [[World Heritage Site]] [[Gondwana Rainforests of Australia]] inscribed in 1986 and added to the [[Australian National Heritage List]] in 2007.  It is also part of the [[Scenic Rim]] [[Important Bird Area]], identified as such by [[BirdLife International]] because of its importance in the conservation of several species of [[threatened]] birds. &amp;lt;ref name=bli&amp;gt;BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Scenic Rim. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-10-03.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Description==
Its vegetation is primarily [[sub-tropical]] [[rain forest]] with some wet [[sclerophyll]] forest.

Two watercourses named Hidden and Finches Creeks flow to the east out of the reserve. It was dedicated as a Flora Reserve in 1963. Flora Reserve is the highest protected status for forest areas in the [[Protected areas of Australia|Australian National Parks]] system. Prior to 1963 the area was classified as a Forest Reserve. The fringes of the reserve were logged for red cedar, [[hoop pine]] and white beech. Bullock teams were used to drag out the logs. The reserve is composed of virgin old growth sub-tropical rain forest and [[hardwood]] species - [[Eucalyptus ovata|flooded gum]], tallowwood, [[ironbark]] and white mahogany.

The reserve has no formed walking tracks. It has no public access except through [[Lamington National Park]] in [[Queensland]]. On the NSW side of the border it is bounded by private landholdings. It includes an area of [[escarpment]] rising to over 1000 metres that forms part of the Queensland/NSW border. It is intended to be a place where the flora and fauna are free from interference from humans, domestic animals and feral pests.
