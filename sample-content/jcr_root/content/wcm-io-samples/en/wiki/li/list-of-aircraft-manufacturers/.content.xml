It contains the ICAO/common name, manufacturers name(s), country and other data, with the known years of operation in parentheses. The ICAO names are listed in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;bold&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Having an ICAO name does not mean that a manufacturer is still in operation today, just that some of the aircraft produced by that manufacturer are still flying.
