[[File:Linguicabrazil.jpg|thumb|right|190px|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Linguiça&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for sale in [[Espirito Santo]], Brazil]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Linguiça&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-pt|lĩˈɡwisɐ}}) is a form of smoke cured [[pork]] [[sausage]] seasoned with [[garlic]] and [[paprika]] in Portuguese-speaking countries.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Linguiça&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, like many other sausages, is generally served as part of a heavy meal, typically accompanied by rice, beans, and other pork products. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Feijoada]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, for example, is a traditional [[Brazil|Brazilian]] dish, also common in [[Angola]], that incorporates &amp;apos;&amp;apos;linguiça&amp;apos;&amp;apos; with [[bean]]s, [[ham hock]]s, and other foods.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;copacabana-feijoada&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web | publisher = Copacabana.info | date = 2008 | url = http://www.copacabana.info/feijoada.html | title = Brazilian Feijoada Recipe and History | accessdate = 2008-04-22}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In Brazil, one variant is specially popular, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;linguiça calabresa&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or simply &amp;apos;&amp;apos;calabresa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, prepared originally with Calabrese pepper (nowadays with South American pepper) by Italian immigrants and particularly used in pizzas as a spicy sausage. Its popularity compares with [[pepperoni]] in the United States. Thus its common to differentiate the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;linguiça calabresa&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from its counterpart &amp;apos;&amp;apos;linguiça portuguesa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, prepared from the original Portuguese recipe and also served in pizzas as mild sausage, generally with egg slices.

Outside of continental [[Portugal]], [[Azores Islands]], Madeira Islands and [[Brazil]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;linguiça&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is also popular in [[Goa]], [[Southeastern Massachusetts]], [[North Shore (Massachusetts)|Massachusetts&amp;apos; North Shore]], [[California]], [[Oregon]], [[Seattle]], [[New Jersey]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Okinawa]]. It is also available in many grocery stores in southern [[New Hampshire]], and southern [[Maine]]. In these regions it is typically sliced before being braised or grilled.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Linguiça&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is also used in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Francesinha]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a traditional Portuguese dish, from [[Porto]]. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;linguiça&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is incorporated in its sauce, giving it a distinct flavor.&amp;lt;ref name = &amp;quot;linguica-molho-francesinha&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web | publisher = Petitchef | date = 2008 | url = http://pt.petitchef.com/receitas/molho-francesinha-mais-simples-fid-115153 | title = Lingüiça in Francesinha Dish | accessdate = 2009-01-01]}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In Hawaii, [[McDonald&amp;apos;s]] restaurants serve breakfasts featuring &amp;apos;&amp;apos;linguiça&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Hawaiian &amp;apos;&amp;apos;linguiça&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as Portuguese sausage, is usually smoked using banana leaves.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bizjournals-mcdonalds-spam&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web | publisher = Pacific Business News | date = 2002-06-11 | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/2002/06/10/daily22.html | title = McDonald&amp;apos;s test-markets Spam | accessdate = 2008-04-22}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Linguiça&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a popular dish in [[Mangalore]] among the Catholic community. Mangalorean &amp;apos;&amp;apos;linguiça&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is spicier than Portuguese &amp;apos;&amp;apos;linguiça&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and is more closely related to [[Goan chouriço]]. It is strongly flavored with red chillies, peppercorns, turmeric, and salt. It is typically prepared by half frying onions, adding sugar and vinegar to the meat, and cooking over a low flame, preferably wood fire.
