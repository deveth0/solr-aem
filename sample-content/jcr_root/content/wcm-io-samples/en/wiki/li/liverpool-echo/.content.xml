The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Liverpool Echo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a newspaper published by [[Trinity Mirror]] in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], [[England]]. It is published Monday to Saturday, and is Liverpool&amp;apos;s Daily newspaper. Until 13 January 2012 it had a sister morning paper, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Liverpool Daily Post]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In the period December 2010-June 2011, it had an average daily circulation of 85,463.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;circ&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Historically the newspaper was published by the Liverpool Daily Post &amp;amp; Echo Ltd.

The editor is Alistair Machray, who has previously edited the Welsh edition of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Liverpool Daily Post|Daily Post]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 1879 the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Liverpool Echo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was published as a cheaper sister paper to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Liverpool Daily Post&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. From its inception until 1917 the newspaper cost a halfpenny. It is now 55p Monday to Friday and 70p on Saturday.
During the 70&amp;apos;s and 80&amp;apos;s there was an offshoot newspaper printed on a Saturday evening containing all the round-up of that days sport, results of football matches and related stories, it was labeled the &amp;apos;pink echo&amp;apos; and it&amp;apos;s pages were pink in colour to differentiate it from the daily version.

The limited company expanded internationally and in 1985 was restructured as Trinity Holdings Plc. The two original newspapers had just previously been re-launched in tabloid format, reflecting the difficult times of high unemployment and social unrest in Liverpool in the early 1980s.

A special Sunday edition of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Echo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was published on 16 April 1989, for reporting on the previous day&amp;apos;s [[Hillsborough disaster]], in which 96 [[Liverpool F.C.]] fans were fatally injured at the [[FA Cup]] semi-final tie in [[Sheffield]]. Every single one of the 75,000 copies printed was sold.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.newsint-archive.co.uk/pages/S.asp?pubsel=BOTH&amp;amp;SrchText=Hillsborough&amp;amp;DateFromDD=22&amp;amp;DateFromMM=Apr&amp;amp;DateFromYY=1989&amp;amp;DateToDD=30&amp;amp;DateToMM=Apr&amp;amp;DateToYY=1989&amp;amp;ResultListMax=200&amp;amp;head=&amp;amp;byline=&amp;amp;sect=&amp;amp;Caption=&amp;amp;edn=&amp;amp;page=&amp;amp;SortOrder=Asc&amp;amp;SortField=SDate&amp;amp;Submit1=Search&amp;amp;BackDD=Day&amp;amp;BackMM=Month&amp;amp;BackYY=Year&amp;amp;source=thetimes&amp;amp;SortField=Pub&amp;amp;SortOrder=asc&amp;amp;SortField=EDN&amp;amp;SortOrder=asc&amp;amp;SortField=Page&amp;amp;SortOrder=asc&amp;amp;ST=NS&amp;amp;SortSpec=&amp;amp;ResultMaxDocs=200&amp;amp;Site=ALL&amp;amp;Collection=NI&amp;amp;ResultCount=20&amp;amp;summreqd=yes&amp;amp;indexkey=29D8117191423728026E160&amp;amp;advsrch=0&amp;amp;QueryText=(Hillsborough)+%3CAND%3E+(PUB%3DBOTH)+%3CAND%3E+((SDate%3E%3D4%2F22%2F1989)+%3CAND%3E+(SDate%3C%3D4%2F30%2F1989))&amp;amp;_P=1]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1999 Trinity merged with [[Mirror Group Newspapers]] to become [[Trinity Mirror]], the largest stable of newspapers in the country.
