This article lists the wide variety of [[locomotive]]s and [[multiple unit]]s that have operated on [[Great Britain]]&amp;apos;s railway network, since Nationalisation in 1948.

[[British Rail]] used [[British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification|several numbering schemes]] for classifying its [[Steam locomotives of British Railways|steam locomotive types]] and other rolling stock, before settling on the [[TOPS]] computer system in the late 1960s. TOPS has remained in use ever since.

==Locomotives==
{{main|List of British Rail modern traction locomotive classes}}

* Diesel locomotives: Classes 01–69
* DC electric and electro-diesel locomotives: Classes 70–79
* AC electric locomotives: Classes 80–96
* Departmental locos (those not in revenue-earning use): Class 97
* Steam locomotives in use after 1968: Class 98
* Miscellaneous locomotives, including builders&amp;apos; demonstrators.
