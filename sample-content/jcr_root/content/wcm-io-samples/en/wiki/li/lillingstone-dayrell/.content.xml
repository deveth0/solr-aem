&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lillingstone Dayrell&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].  It is in [[Aylesbury Vale]], about three and a half miles north of [[Buckingham]], eight miles west of [[Milton Keynes]] and five miles south of [[Towcester]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lillingstone Dayrell with Luffield Abbey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  and the neighbouring [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Lillingstone Lovell]] are separate [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]]es within Aylesbury Vale district.

The village name &amp;apos;Lillingstone&amp;apos; is [[Old English language|Anglo Saxon]] in origin, and means &amp;apos;Lytel&amp;apos;s boundary stone&amp;apos;, referring to the proximity of both places to the border with [[Northamptonshire]].  In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 both settlements were recorded jointly as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lillingestan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; though already at that time there were two [[Manorialism|manor]]s owned respectively by the Dayrell and Lovell families. The suffix &amp;apos;Dayrell&amp;apos; (as &amp;apos;Dayerell&amp;apos;) was first recorded in the fourteenth century.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=62564 &amp;apos;Parishes : Lillingstone Dayrell&amp;apos;]{{spaced ndash}}[[Victoria History of the Counties of England]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A History of the County of Buckingham:&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Volume 4 (1927), pp. 187-191.
