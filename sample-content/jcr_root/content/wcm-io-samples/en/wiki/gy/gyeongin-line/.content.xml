The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gyeongin Line&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gyeonginseon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a railway mainline in South Korea, currently connecting [[Guro Station]] in [[Seoul]] and [[Incheon Station|Incheon]]. Passenger transport along the line is integrated into [[Seoul Subway Line 1]].

==History==

The Gyeongin Line was the first railway line built on the [[Korean peninsula]]. It was opened between [[Noryangjin Station|Noryangjin]], on the shore of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] across from Seoul, [[Geumchon Station|Geumchon]], in [[Incheon]], on September 18, 1899.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;lineop&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.korail.com/2007/kra/ope/ope08000/w_ope08606.jsp |title=경영원칙 &amp;gt; 경영공시 &amp;gt; 영업현황 &amp;gt; 영업거리현황 |publisher=Korail |accessdate=2010-11-27}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Soon after, the line was extended across the Han River into [[Seoul Station]], and beyond Geumchon to the port of Incheon.  When the construction of the [[Gyeongbu Line]] was completed from [[Busan Station|Busan]] to Guro on January 1, 1905, the Seoul-Guro section of the Gyeongin Line became part of the Gyeongbu Line.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;lineop&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  The remaining Gyeongin Line from Guro to Incheon is {{convert|27.0|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} long.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;lineop&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Following the 1961 coup, the [[Supreme Council for National Reconstruction]] started South Korea&amp;apos;s [[Five-year plans of South Korea#1962–1966|first five-year plan]], which included a construction program to complete the railway network, to foster economic growth.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;5yr-plan&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silvernetnews.com/?inc=newsview&amp;amp;no=8229&amp;amp;s=20&amp;amp;ss=0&amp;amp;sss=0 |title=&amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt;철마 110년, 영고의 자취 [12] 경제개발과 철도&amp;lt;/nowiki&amp;gt; |language=[[Korean language|Korean]] |date=2010-03-20 |publisher=Silvernet News |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  As part of the program, from November 1963, two additional tracks were laid to the north of the existing tracks from [[Yeongdeungpo Station]] on the Gyeongbu Line to [[Dongincheon Station]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;5yr-plan&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  The {{convert|27.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} of new tracks, also called Gyeonginbuk Line, entered service on September 18, 1965.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;5yr-plan&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

The line was among the first in South Korea to be electrified with the 25&amp;amp;nbsp;kV/60&amp;amp;nbsp;Hz [[Alternating current|AC]] [[Overhead wires|catenary]] system, when two tracks over the {{convert|38.9|km|mi|abbr=on}} between Seoul and Iksan entered service on August 15, 1974, for the Seoul Subway Line 1.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;electrification&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epic.or.kr/cont/yearbook/download/yearbook_chap07_3.pdf |title=Electricity Almanac 2009 |publisher=Korea Electric Association |accessdate=2010-10-27}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Electrification of the second two tracks started with the {{convert|14.9|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Guro to [[Bupyeong Station|Bupyeong]], which went into service on January 29, 1999.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;electrification&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  The {{convert|5.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} until [[Juan Station|Juan]] followed on March 15, 2002, and the final {{convert|6.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} on December 21, 2005.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;electrification&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Operation==

[[Korail]] operated regular passenger service along the Gyeongin Line until the electrification of the line in the early 1970s, when passenger service was integrated into Seoul Subway Line 1.  Line 1 trains using the Gyeongin Line provide up to ten trains an hour per direction, with services towards Guro, [[Cheongnyangni Station (aboveground)|Cheongnyangni]], [[Dongmyo Station|Dongmyo]], [[Seongbuk Station|Seongbuk]], [[Chang-dong Station|Chang-dong]], [[Uijeongbu Station|Uijeongbu]], [[Yangju Station|Yangju]], [[Dongducheon Station|Dongducheon]] and [[Soyosan Station|Soyosan]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smrt.co.kr/Eng/Subway/Train/Timetable.jsp?station=1812 |title=Timetable (Incheon) |publisher=SMRTC |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
