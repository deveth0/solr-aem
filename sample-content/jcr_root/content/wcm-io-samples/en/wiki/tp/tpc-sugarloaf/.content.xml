&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;TPC Sugarloaf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a private [[golf club (institution)|golf club]], located within the [[gated community]] at Sugarloaf Country Club in [[Duluth, Georgia]], a suburb of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]].

The facility consists of three 9-hole [[golf course]]s that were designed by [[Greg Norman]], and is a member of the [[Tournament Players Club]] network operated by the [[PGA Tour]]. It was the home of the tour&amp;apos;s annual [[AT&amp;amp;T Classic]], formerly the BellSouth Classic, golf tournament from 1997 until it ended in 2008. It began hosting the [[Greater Gwinnett Championship]] on the [[Champions Tour]] in 2013.

The BellSouth/AT&amp;amp;T Classic was always played over the original two nines, The Stables and The Meadows, which opened the week before its first staging of the tournament in 1997. Just weeks beforehand the property was hit by a tornado which damaged many trees on the first and ninth holes, and leveled some of the corporate tent structures around the 18th green. The third nine, named The Pines, was opened in 2000. The land on which the courses were built was formerly the O. Wayne Rollins family farm, where they kept pure-bred cattle and horses.
