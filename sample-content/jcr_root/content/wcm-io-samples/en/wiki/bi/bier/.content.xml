A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;bier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a stand on which a [[cadaver|corpse]], [[coffin]], or casket containing a corpse, is placed to [[lie in state]] or to be carried to the [[grave (burial)|grave]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (American Heritage Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1973), s.v., &amp;quot;bier&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In [[Christian burial]], the bier is often placed in the centre of the [[nave]] with candles surrounding it, and remains in place during the funeral.

The bier is a flat frame, traditionally [[wood]]en but sometimes of other materials.  In antiquity it was often a wooden board on which the dead were placed, covered with a [[shroud]].  In modern times, the corpse is rarely carried on the bier without being first placed in a [[coffin]] or casket, though the coffin or casket is sometimes kept open.

A bier is often draped with cloth to lend dignity to the funeral service. The modern funeral industry uses a collapsible aluminium bier on wheels, known as a &amp;quot;church truck&amp;quot; to move the coffin to and from the church or [[funeral home]] for services.

Biers are generally smaller than the coffin or casket they support for reasons of appearance. As a result, they are not particularly stable, and can tip over unless well centred and undisturbed.

The Carmelite Priory, [[Mdina]], Malta has a colourful bier on display that was used to carry the [[monk]]s or [[friar]]s before they were buried without a coffin.
