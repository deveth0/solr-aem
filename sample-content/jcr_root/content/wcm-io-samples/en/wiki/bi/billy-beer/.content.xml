&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Billy Beer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[beer]] first made in the [[United States of America]] in July 1977, by the [[Falls City Brewing Company]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;falls&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falstaffbrewing.com/falls.htm |title=Falls City Beer |publisher=Falstaffbrewing.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was promoted by &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://tech.mit.edu/V98/PDF/N11.pdf#4 The Tech - MIT] p. 4&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Billy Carter]], the younger brother of then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4D9153BF931A35756C0A96E948260 |title=WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Bullish on Billy Beer |publisher=New York Times |date=1988-05-02 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The beer was produced by Cold Spring Brewing, [[Utica Club|West End Brewing]], and [[Pearl Brewing Company]].

==Label==
Written on each can were these words of endorsement, which were followed by Billy Carter&amp;apos;s signature:&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.falstaffbrewing.com/_borders/billybeercan.gif&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Brewed expressly for and with the personal approval of one of America&amp;apos;s all-time great beer drinkers - Billy Carter&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;I had this beer brewed up just for me.  I think it&amp;apos;s the best I ever tasted.  And I&amp;apos;ve tasted a lot.  I think you&amp;apos;ll like it, too.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

==As a collectible==
After Billy Beer ceased production, advertisements appeared in newspapers offering to sell Billy Beer cans for several hundred to several thousands of [[United States dollar|dollar]]s each, attempting to profit from their perceived rarity. However, since the cans were actually produced in the millions, the real value of a can ranged from 50 [[United States dollar|cents]] to one [[United States dollar|dollar]] in 1981.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06EED61738F935A35751C1A967948260 |title=No Point In Treasuring Billy Beer Cans |publisher=New York Times |date=1981-12-06 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Billy Beer was also featured on an episode of the reality series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Auction Kings]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, where an appraiser deemed a case of unopened Billy Beer to be worthless; however, at the featured auction, the case was sold for $100.

The hit television show &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Simpsons]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; featured [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] drinking a can of Billy Beer in the 1997 episode &amp;quot;[[Lisa the Skeptic]]&amp;quot;; after Bart tells him that the skeleton he is trying to hide is probably old enough already, he counters Bart&amp;apos;s remark by introducing his Billy Beer stating that people said the same thing about the beer. After he drinks the beer, he says  &amp;quot;We elected the [[Jimmy Carter|wrong Carter]]&amp;quot;. Also in the 1992 episode &amp;quot;[[The Otto Show]]&amp;quot; Homer finds a can
of Billy Beer in the pocket of his old concert jacket, and drinks it.

Despite Carter&amp;apos;s promotion of Billy Beer his private preference was for Pabst Blue Ribbon.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;In Private, It&amp;apos;s Pabst for Billy Carter&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldbeerads.blogspot.com/2013/03/falls-city-beer-newspaper-ad-1970.html |title=In Private, It&amp;apos;s Pabst for Billy Carter |publisher=The Milwaukee Journal |date=June 10, 1978 |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
