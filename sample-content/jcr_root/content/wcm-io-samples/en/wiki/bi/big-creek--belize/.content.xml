&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Big Creek&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cala Grande&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[sea port]] facility in [[Belize]]. Big Creek is a deep-water port on the [[Caribbean Sea]] in Belize&amp;apos;s [[Toledo District]] (just south of the boundary with Stann Creek District), constructed in the 1990s. It is the nation&amp;apos;s second most important port, after [[Belize City]]. Big Creek is the main port for Belize&amp;apos;s [[banana]] industry; [[citrus fruit]] and [[shrimp]] are also exported from here. It is also the location from which oil, extracted from the fields of [[Spanish Lookout]], is exported.

Big Creek also was the location in which the Peter Hughes dive boat &amp;quot;Wave Dancer&amp;quot; capsized during Hurricane Iris in October 2001, killing 20 persons, comprising 3 crew members and 17 vacationing divers from Richmond, Virginia.[http://www.cdnn.info/news/article/a050226.html Official report.]
