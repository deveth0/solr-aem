==Origin of name==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bioneer]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (root: &amp;quot;biological pioneer&amp;quot;) is a [[neologism]] coined by founder [[Kenny Ausubel]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;utne&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Utne Reader. (1999 Mar-Apr). [http://www.utne.com/1999-03-01/15IdeasThatCouldShaketheWorld.aspx &amp;quot;15 Ideas That Could Shake the World&amp;quot;]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Utne Reader]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Retrieved on 2009-08-14.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It describes individuals and groups working in diverse disciplines who have crafted creative solutions to various [[ecosystem|environmental]] and socio-cultural problems rooted in shared core values, including [[Holistic#See also|whole systems]], ([[Buckminster Fuller#Neologisms|anticipatory]]) thinking, a view of all life as interdependent, and sustainable mutual aid.

==Annual conference==

The first National Bioneers Conference, organized by Co-Founders [[Kenny Ausubel]] and [[Nina Simons]], took place in 1990.  Currently the conference takes place annually in [[San Rafael, California]], on the third weekend in October. The national conference highlights the work of scientific and social innovators and helps support, nurture and propagate their ideas and models. Conference speakers come from [[interdisciplinary]] fields: [[environmentalism|environmental]] and socio-political activism; &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; [[biology]], [[chemistry]], design, [[architecture]] and [[urban planning]]; [[organic farming|organic and &amp;quot;beyond organic&amp;quot; farming]] and gardening; [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] perspectives; [[biodiversity]], [[bioremediation]], and [[Nature reserve|wildland preservation]]; [[alternative energy]]; engaged spirituality, literature and the arts; [[holistic health|holistic and &amp;quot;ecological&amp;quot; medicine]]; [[ethnobotany]]; [[Corporate social responsibility|socially responsible]] entrepreneurship, business and philanthropy; the [[environmental justice]], women&amp;apos;s and youth movements; [[independent media]]; etc.
