The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Big Brother Awards&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; recognize &amp;quot;the government and private sector organizations ... which have done the most to threaten [[personal privacy]]&amp;quot;.
They are named after the [[George Orwell]] character [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]] from the novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. They are awarded yearly to authorities, companies, organisations, and persons that have been acting particularly and consistently to threaten or violate people&amp;apos;s privacy, or disclosed people&amp;apos;s [[personal data]] to third parties.

The awards are intended to draw public attention to [[privacy]] issues and related alarming trends in society, especially in [[data privacy]]. The contest is organized by a [[nongovernmental organization]] [http://www.iure.org/ Iuridicum remedium].

The German Big Brother Awards are organised and hosted by [[digitalcourage]] (formerly FoeBuD) in [[Bielefeld]].

The United States most recently hosted The Big Brother Awards on April 14th of 2005 in Seattle, WA.  They had previously been hosted in Berkeley, CA on the 21st of April, 2004; New York, NY on the 3rd of April, 2003; San Francisco, CA on the 18th of April, 2002; Cambridge on the 7th of March, 2001; and initially in Washington, D.C. on April 7th 1999.
