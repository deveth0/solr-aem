[[File:Bill Richmond 1810.jpg|thumb|Richmond in 1810]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bill Richmond&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1763&amp;amp;ndash;December 28, 1829) was an [[African]] American [[boxing|boxer]], born a [[slavery|slave]] in Cuckold&amp;apos;s Town (now [[Richmondtown, Staten Island|Richmondtown]]), [[Staten Island, New York]].  His nickname was &amp;apos;The Black Terror&amp;apos;.

During the [[American Revolutionary War]], Richmond was the servant of Lord Percy, the [[Duke of Northumberland]], who took him to England in 1777. On September 22, 1776, Richmond was the hangman who executed [[Nathan Hale]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/integrate/CHRON1.html |title=A CHRONOLOGY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MILITARY SERVICE |accessdate=2007-02-09 |work=Integration of the Armed Forces |publisher=[[United States Army Aviation and Missile Command|Redstone Arsenal Historical Information]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070301002822/http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/integrate/CHRON1.html &amp;lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&amp;gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-01}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Later, Richmond was sent to school in [[Yorkshire]] and apprenticed to a cabinet maker in [[York]]. However, he made his career as a boxer, narrowly losing to later British and world champion [[Tom Cribb]]. After his retirement from boxing, he bought the Horse and Dolphin pub in [[Leicester Square]] and set up a boxing academy.

Richmond received no boxing tutoring and was entirely self-taught. By today&amp;apos;s standards, Richmond, who weighed between {{Convert|140|and|147|lbs|kg}}, would have been a [[welterweight]], and yet he often fought men who weighed {{Convert|4|to|5|st|kg}} heavier than himself. He had excellent footwork and quick hands, which enabled him to avoid the big punches and outwork bigger fighters (the [[bob and weave]] technique). This was demonstrated in his fight with Tom Cribb, who was unable to land a punch in the early rounds. However, Cribb&amp;apos;s superior weight and power eventually caught up with Richmond, who lost in the 60th round.

He was also a friend and coach of [[Tom Molineaux]], another freed slave who took up boxing in England and fought Cribb twice for the title of world champion.

He died at his home in London, England in 1829.
