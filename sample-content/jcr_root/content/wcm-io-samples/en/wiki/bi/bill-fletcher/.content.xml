&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bill Fletcher&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[politician]] from the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[North Carolina]]. Fletcher was the Republican nominee for [[North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction]] in the [[North Carolina Council of State election, 2004]].

The race between Fletcher and [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] candidate [[June Atkinson]] was nearly even; while a statewide recount was underway in November 2004, Fletcher and several other candidates filed [[lawsuit|suit]] against the [http://www.sboe.state.nc.us/ North Carolina Board of Elections], challenging that the counting of [[provisional ballots]] (mandated by the [[Help America Vote Act]]) was contrary to the Constitution of North Carolina. The [[North Carolina Democratic Party|Democratic-controlled]] [[North Carolina General Assembly]] decided the race (August 23, 2005) in favor of June Atkinson.  It was the last 2005 state-wide race in the [[United States]] to be decided.

Eleanor Goattee defeated Mr. Fletcher in November 2005; he was not reelected to the District 9 seat on the [[Wake County Public Schools|Wake County Board of Education]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;
