&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;DCide&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a privately held, [[Washington, D.C.]] based independent [[record label]]. The label was started in summer of 1995 by founding partners Jeffrey B. Clyburn, Burton Gray and Mark Thorp.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=About DCide Records|url=http://dcide.com/p-about.htm|work=Web|publisher=DCide}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Their first act [[Nothingface]] sold over 500,000 records worldwide and is widely recognized as one of the standard-bearers for the new metal genre.  In 2002, DCide entered into a partnership with [[Geffen Records]] to release the debut record from [[TRUSTcompany]] out of [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. TRUSTcompany&amp;apos;s guitar driven rock evokes memories of the [[Smashing Pumpkins]] with Deftones-like vocal stylings and bottom heavy riffing reminiscent of [[Led Zeppelin]]. TRUSTcompany enjoyed both critical and commercial success as their debut album &amp;quot;[[The Lonely Position of Neutral]]&amp;quot; went on to be certified Gold.

TRUSTcompanyâ€™s sophomore record &amp;quot;[[True Parallels]]&amp;quot; was released by DCide/Geffen in March 2005.  In 2009, DCide/Templar Label Group released the debut EP&amp;apos;s from [[Shabazz Palaces]], the new project from Ishmael Butler, the creator, rapper and producer for the Grammy award winning rap group [[Digable Planets]]. DCide began its relationship with Butler with its 2003 release of his first post [[Digable Planets]] project, Cherrywine.  In 2011, DCide will release &amp;quot;[[Well Done (album)|Well Done]]&amp;quot; a collaboration album by [[Action Bronson]] and [[Statik Selektah]].
