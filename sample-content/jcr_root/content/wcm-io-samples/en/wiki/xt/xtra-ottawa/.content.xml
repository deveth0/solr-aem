&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xtra Ottawa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ISSN 1195-6127&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, formerly &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Capital Xtra&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[LGBT|lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender]] community newspaper published in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It was launched in 1993. Unlike its biweekly sister publications &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Xtra!|Xtra]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Toronto]] and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Xtra Vancouver]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Vancouver]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xtra Ottawa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which started as a monthly, is now published 17 times a year, with a publication schedule of every three weeks. The Ottawa edition has a current circulation of 20,000 copies which reach 36,000 readers.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xtra Ottawa&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also publishes a gay tourism map, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Out in Ottawa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, every spring; the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ultimate Pride Guide&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in mid-July; and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Index&amp;apos;&amp;apos; gay business directory in December.

==History==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xtra Ottawa&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was launched by [[Pink Triangle Press]] as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Capital Xtra&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1993, shortly after the organization learned that Ottawa&amp;apos;s existing LGBT publication, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[GO Info]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, had largely collapsed and was publishing irregularly with only a skeleton staff. Brandon Matheson, then a freelance journalist working in the [[Parliament Hill]] Press Gallery, was chosen to launch the project in conjunction with George Hartsgrove, then an administrator at the [[University of Ottawa]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;anniversary&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Dale Smith, [http://www.xtra.ca/public/Ottawa/Looking_back_on_issue_1_of_Capital_Xtra-6265.aspx &amp;quot;Looking back on issue #1 of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Capital Xtra!&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Capital Xtra!&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, February 11, 2009.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;GO Info&amp;apos;&amp;apos; briefly tried to beef up its content in the face of its new competition, but folded in early 1994.

In 2007, [[Ottawa City Council]] attempted to pass restrictions on the paper&amp;apos;s distribution in public facilities after a complaint was filed by Greg Evans. Evans, a father who sat down to read the newspaper while his eight-year-old son was participating in basketball practice at the Hunt Club-Riverside Community Centre, was reportedly offended by the sexually explicit nature of two advertisements in the publication.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Jake Rupert, [http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/city/story.html?id=2bea10f5-f4e1-4c52-a818-8a11a1e4e7ae &amp;quot;Rights versus &amp;apos;wrong&amp;apos;&amp;quot;]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ottawa Citizen]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, March 10, 2007.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Evans stated that he was LGBT-friendly and that his complaint was not motivated by [[homophobia]], but by a concern for the possibility of exposing children to sexually explicit material &amp;apos;&amp;apos;regardless&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of whether that material was gay or straight in nature.

In March 2010, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Capital Xtra&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xtra Ottawa&amp;apos;&amp;apos; with the launch of a redesign of the Xtra papers in the Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver markets.

==Contributors==

Early contributors to the magazine included [[Irshad Manji]], [[Alex Munter]], David Pepper, Andrew Griffin and Don McLean.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;anniversary&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

Because of its location in Canada&amp;apos;s capital, the paper also publishes extensive coverage of LGBT issues in national politics, which is also reprinted in its sister publications in Toronto and Vancouver. The chain&amp;apos;s first national political journalist was [[Neil Herland]], and its current national political journalist is Dale Smith.

Matheson is now the publisher of all three Xtra! publications.

Associate publisher and [[managing editor]] Marcus McCann has been running the newspaper&amp;apos;s operations since August 2008. Gareth Kirkby was the associate publisher and managing editor from 2005 until August 2008.

==Community involvement==

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xtra Ottawa&amp;apos;&amp;apos; puts on a series of events every year for the Ottawa queer community: the LGX business &amp;amp; consumer expo each spring, the Transgress Festival as part of the Ottawa International Writer&amp;apos;s Festival each October, and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Capital Xtra!&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Community Achievement Awards ceremony to acknowledge local volunteers and activists.
