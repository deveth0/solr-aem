&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wyszków&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-pl|&amp;apos;|w|y|sz|k|u|f}} is a town in northeastern [[Poland]] with 26,500 inhabitants (2003). It is the capital of [[Wyszków County]] ({{lang-pl|powiat wyszkowski}}).  Wyszków is in the [[Masovian Voivodeship]] (since 1999); previously it was in the [[Warsaw Voivodeship]] (until 1975) and the [[Ostrołęka Voivodeship]] (1975–1998).

==Description==
The village of Wyszków was first documented in 1203. The town was founded in 1502. It was destroyed during the [[Second Northern War]] in 1655-1660, when it lost its significance in the region. Industry developed after 1897, when the Pilawa-Tluszcz-[[Ostrołęka]] railway was built.

==Jews in Wyszków==

Before World War II half of Wyszków&amp;apos;s population of 9,000 were [[Jew]]ish; after the war there were none. On 14 September 1997 a memorial to [[Holocaust]] victims was unveiled in Wyszków. It is made of reclaimed Jewish gravestones that had been removed from the site in 1939 by German forces, who used them as paving stones and to build the local [[Gestapo]] headquarters. Scores of these desecrated tombstones were recovered and incorporated as part of the monument.

Wyszków was the birthplace of [[Mordechaj Anielewicz]] in 1919.
