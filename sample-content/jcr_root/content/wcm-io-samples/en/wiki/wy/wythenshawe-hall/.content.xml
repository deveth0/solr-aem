&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wythenshawe Hall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 16th-century medieval [[Timber framing|timber-framed]] [[historic house]] and former [[stately home]] in [[Wythenshawe]], [[Manchester]], England. It is east of [[Altrincham]] and south of [[Stretford]], five miles (8&amp;amp;nbsp;km) south of [[Manchester]] city centre, in Wythenshawe Park.

==History==
The half-timbered [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] house was the home of the Tatton family for almost 400 years. It was built in about 1540 by Robert Tatton of [[Chester, Cheshire|Chester]]. During the [[English Civil War]], the hall was unsuccessfully defended by [[Robert Tatton]] against [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]&amp;apos;s forces during the winter of 1643.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |title=Wythenshawe Hall |publisher=Manchester City Galleries |url=http://pastscape.english-heritage.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=76513 |accessdate=8 November 2007}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; After the war the Wythenshawe estate expanded to about {{convert|2500|acre|sqkm}}.

In 1924 [[Robert Henry Grenville Tatton]] inherited the Wythenshawe estate and yielded to pressure from the then Manchester Corporation, who were in need of land for housing. The corporation bought {{convert|2500|acre}} in 1926, and what used to be farmland became one of the largest housing estates in Europe. Wythenshawe Hall itself and {{convert|250|acre}} of its surrounding parkland were sold to [[Ernest Simon, 1st Baron Simon of Wythenshawe|Ernest Simon]], who donated them to Manchester Corporation &amp;quot;to be used solely for the public good&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=RileyP22&amp;gt;{{Harvnb|Riley|1999|p=22}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The hall has been used as a museum since 1930.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |title=Wythenshawe Hall |publisher=English Heritage |url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/our-other-venues/wythenshawe-hall/the-hall/ |accessdate=3 October 2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The park now houses, amongst other facilities, a community farm and a [[horticulture]] centre, to the east of the hall. Every June there is a re-enactment of the 1643 siege of Wythenshawe Hall by Cromwell&amp;apos;s troops.

Wythenshawe Hall&amp;apos;s Home Farm was west of the hall. Some of its structures have survived as park maintenance buildings, but many were demolished when the [[housing estate]]s were built. The gatehouse at the north side of the park still stands.

Wythenshawe Hall was [[Listed building|listed]] as a Grade II* structure in 1952. Its former stable block, to the west of the hall, was Grade II listed in 1974.

After being in storage for a number of years it was installed at Wythenshawe.

== Closure ==
The Hall is currently closed to the public, due to spending cuts. One proposition is that [[Manchester City Council]] could sell the building to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1422304_budget-crisis-could-lead-manchester-council-to-give-away-heaton-hall-and-wythenshawe-hall|title=Budget crisis could lead Manchester council to give away Heaton Hall and Wythenshawe Hall|work=Manchester Evening News|date=1 June 2011|last=Linton|first=Deborah|publisher=M.E.N.
