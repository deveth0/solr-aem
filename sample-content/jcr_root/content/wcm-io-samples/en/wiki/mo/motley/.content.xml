&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Motley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refers to the traditional [[costume]] of the [[court jester]], or the [[Arlecchino|harlequin]] character in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[commedia dell&amp;apos;arte]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The latter wears a patchwork of red, green and blue diamonds that is still a [[fashion]] motif.

The word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;motley&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is described in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as a [[cognate]] with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;medley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, although the unrelated &amp;apos;&amp;apos;mottled&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has also contributed to the meaning.  The word is most commonly used as an [[adjective]] or [[noun]], but is also seen as a [[verb]] and [[adverb]].  When used as a noun, it can mean &amp;quot;a varied mixture.&amp;quot; As an adjective, it is generally disparaging &amp;amp;mdash; a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;motley collection&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an uninspiring pile of stuff, as in the cliche [[motley crew]].

The word originated in England between the 14th and 17th centuries and referred to a [[wool]]en fabric of mixed colors.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Apparel Search Glossary [http://www.apparelsearch.com/glossary_m_1.htm &amp;quot;Motley.&amp;quot;] Retrieved on: December 4, 2007.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  It was the characteristic dress of the professional fool.  During the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], motley served the important purpose of keeping the fool outside the social hierarchy and therefore not subject to class distinction.  Since the fool was outside the dress laws ([[sumptuary law]]), the fool was able to speak more freely.

Likewise, motley did not have to be checkered and has been recently thought to be one pattern with different colored threads running through it.
