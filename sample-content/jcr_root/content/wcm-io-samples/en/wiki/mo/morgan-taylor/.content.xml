&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Frederick Morgan Taylor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 17, 1903 &amp;amp;ndash; February 16, 1975) was an [[USA|American]] [[hurdling|hurdler]], winner of three [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] medals. [http://www.usatf.org/HallOfFame/TF/showBio.asp?HOFIDs=164]

Morgan Taylor, from [[Sioux City, Iowa]], competed in both [[track and field]] and [[American football|football]] at [[Grinnell College]].[http://desmoinesregister.com/sports/extras/hall/1951-track.html#taylor] At the American trials for the [[1924 Summer Olympics]], he broke the world record in the 400 m hurdles on two occasions, making him a favourite for the Olympic gold. In [[Paris]], he broke his World Record again, with a margin of 1.4 seconds to win the gold. However, he had knocked over a hurdle and - because of rules in effect in 1924 - he could not become the World Record holder. Because the second-place finisher was disqualified, the third finisher (and silver medallist) became owner of the new World Record.[http://www.usatf.org/HallOfFame/TF/showBio.asp?HOFIDs=164]

Taylor again qualified for the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]] and [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Olympics]], winning a bronze medal on both occasions, with the titles won by [[David Burghley|Lord Burgley]] and [[Bob Tisdall]]. At his third Olympics, he was honoured for his achievements by carrying the American flag during the opening ceremony of the Games.[http://www.usatf.org/HallOfFame/TF/showBio.asp?HOFIDs=164]
