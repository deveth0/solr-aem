The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mosque of Omar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ar|مسجد عمر بن الخطاب}}) in [[Jerusalem]] is located opposite the southern courtyard of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in the [[Muristan]]. After the [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|Siege of Jerusalem]] in 637 by the [[Rashidun army]] under the command of [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah]], Patriarch [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] refused to surrender except to the Caliph [[Umar|Omar]] (579-644) himself. Omar traveled to Jerusalem and accepted the surrender. He then visited the Church of the Holy Sepulchre where Sophronius invited him to pray inside the Church, but Omar declined so as not to set a precedent and thereby endanger the Church&amp;apos;s status as a Christian site. Instead he prayed outside in the courtyard, in a place where [[David]] was believed to have prayed.

The Mosque of Omar was built in its current shape by the [[Ayyubid]] Sultan [[Al-Afdal ibn Salah ad-Din]] in 1193 CE in memory of this event. It has a {{convert|15|m}} high [[minaret]] that was built before 1465 CE and was renovated by Ottoman sultan [[Abdulmecid I]] (1839–1860).
