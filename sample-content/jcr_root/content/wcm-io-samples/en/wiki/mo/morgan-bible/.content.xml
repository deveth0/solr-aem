        text="&lt;p&gt;[[Image:Morgan Bible 10r.jpg|thumb|350px|&amp;quot;The [[Israelite]]s are repulsed from [[Ai (Bible)|Hai]]&amp;quot; (fol. 10r)]]
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Morgan Bible&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Morgan Library|The Pierpont Morgan Library]], [[New York City|New York]], Ms M. 638) is a medieval picture [[Bible]] of 46 [[Bookbinding|folio]]s.  It is also called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Morgan Bible of Louis IX&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Book of Kings&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Crusader Bible&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Maciejowski Bible&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This book has long been thought to have been created under the direction of [[Louis IX of France]] in the mid-1240s, but [[Allison Stones]], after indications of others such as [[François Avril]], has argued that it was most likely illuminated in the northern counties of France, ca. 1250 (cf most recently Allison Stones, &amp;quot;Questions of style and provenance in the Morgan Bible&amp;quot;, in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Between the Word and the Picture&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Princeton, 2005).  Originally it probably contained only paintings, organized in a consistent [[visual rhythm]] from page to page.  Within 100 years, the book acquired marginal inscriptions in [[Latin]] describing the scenes illustrated.  Cardinal [[Bernard Maciejowski]], [[List of Roman Catholic bishops of Kraków|Bishop of Kraków]], had the book given as a gift to [[Abbas I (Shah of Persia)]] in 1608.  Abbas ordered inscriptions in [[Persian language|Persian]] to be added, mostly translating the Latin ones already there.  Later, perhaps in the eighteenth century, inscriptions were added in [[Judeo-Persian]].  Thus the book consists of beautiful paintings of events from [[Hebrew scripture]], set in the scenery and customs of thirteenth-century [[France]], depicted from a Christian perspective, and surrounded by text in three scripts and five languages (Latin, Persian, Arabic, Judeo-Persian, and [[Hebrew]]).

The Morgan Bible is a masterpiece of [[Gothic art]].  It testifies impressively to how persons make sense of words and images.  [[Historical_reenactment|Historical recreationists]] find in it valuable evidence about medieval clothing, weapons, and armor.

Forty three folios are kept in The Pierpont Morgan Library. Two folios are kept in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (MS nouv. acq. lat. 2294).  A single folio is kept in the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]], Los Angeles (MS 16).
