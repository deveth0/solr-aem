&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Moshe Aviv Tower&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-he|מגדל משה אביב}}), is a {{convert|235|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall [[skyscraper]] located in the demarcated area of the [[Diamond Exchange District|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;bursa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] ([[Israel Diamond Exchange]]) on Jabotinsky Road (No. 7) in northern [[Ramat Gan]], [[Israel]]. The 68-story building is commonly known as City Gate ({{lang-he|שער העיר}}), its original name.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;CTBUH&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/building.php?building_id=935 |title=CTBUH tall building database - City Gate Tower |publisher=[[CTBUH]] |accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;emporis&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/building/citygateramatgan-ramatgan-israel|title=City Gate Ramat Gan|work=Emporis.com|accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is the tallest building in Israel.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;CTBUH&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

==Background==
The building was designed by architects [[Amnon Niv]] and Amnon Schwartz.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/it-s-new-it-s-revolutionary-and-it-s-very-very-tall-1.108271 It&amp;apos;s new, it&amp;apos;s revolutionary and it&amp;apos;s very, very tall]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was named after Moshe Aviv, the owner of the construction company, who died in an accident in October 2001, before its completion.

==Construction==
The design for City Gate was inspired by the famous [[Westend Tower]] in [[Frankfurt]]. Construction on the tower began in 1998 and was completed in 2003 when the tower became occupied. The construction period was extremely short, achieving a sequence of five stories per month with only one shift of 40 workers. The rate of concrete placement per month was {{convert|3000|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}} and on a typical floor there are 42 windows. Total cost of construction was US $133 million. The tower has a total of {{convert|180000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of space. The building appeared in a TV advertisement for the [[Mifal HaPayis]] national lottery before it was completed, in December 2002. To this date it is the most expensive single building in Israel.

There is now an approved plan for a similar tower of the same height, the [[Elite Tower]], across Jabotinsky Road, on the current site of the [[Strauss (company)|Elite Factory]].

==Use==
The Moshe Aviv Tower is a multi-use structure. The top 11 floors consist of {{convert|17000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of residential space divided among 98 apartments.  Below that, the bulk of the tower contains {{convert|63000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of office space. Separate lobbies and elevators serve the residential and office sections. {{convert|1200|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of commercial space occupies the lower floors. There is a synagogue on the third floor for residents, office tenants and visitors. The rooftop of the cylinder part serves as an emergency helipad. The tower also boasts an exclusive fitness club and swimming pool situated on the tower&amp;apos;s carpark annex roof.

On September 27, 2004, as part of the annual global City in Pink lighting campaign for breast cancer, the building was lit completely in bright pink light.
