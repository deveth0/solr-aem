The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Moustached Warbler&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Acrocephalus melanopogon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is an [[Old World warbler]] in the [[genus]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Acrocephalus (bird)|Acrocephalus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It breeds in southern [[Europe]] and southern temperate [[Asia]] with a few in north-west [[Africa]]. It is partially [[bird migration|migratory]]. South west European birds are resident, south east European birds winter in the [[Mediterranean]] breeding range, and the Asiatic race migrates to [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and [[Pakistan]].

It is scarce north of its range, but has occurred as a very rare vagrant as far as [[Poland]] and [[Denmark]]. There are a few reports from [[Great Britain]], including a pair breeding in [[Cambridgeshire]] in 1946, but these records have recently been removed from the official list of British birds.

This [[passerine]] [[bird]] is a species found in upright aquatic vegetation such as reeds and [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]. 3-6 [[bird egg|eggs]] are laid from mid-April and incubated for 14â€“15 days. The nest is built over water among reeds or rushes or in a bush. This species is usually [[monogamous]] (Leisler &amp;amp; Wink 2000).

This is a medium-sized warbler, 12-13.5&amp;amp;nbsp;cm long, slightly larger than the similar [[Sedge Warbler]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Acrocephalus schoenobaenus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The adult has a finely streaked brown back and white underparts. The forehead is flattened, there is a prominent whitish supercilium, grey ear coverts, and the bill is strong and pointed.

The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are more heavily streaked and have markings on the breast. Like most warblers, it is [[insectivorous]] and also feeds on water snails.

The song is fast and similar to the Sedge Warbler and [[Reed Warbler]], with some mimicry and typically acrocephaline whistles added. Its song is softer and more melodious than those of its relatives, and includes phrases reminiscent of the [[Nightingale]]. Unlike the Sedge Warbler, it does not sing in flight.
