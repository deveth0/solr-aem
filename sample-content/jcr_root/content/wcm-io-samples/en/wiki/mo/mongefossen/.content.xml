&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mongefossen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-en|Monge falls}}) is unofficially listed as the fourth-highest [[waterfall]] in the world.  It is located in [[Rauma Municipality]] in [[Møre og Romsdal]] county, [[Norway]].  It is located near the [[European route E136]] highway and the [[Rauma River]], which it flows into.  There is some dispute as to the height, but it is generally listed at {{convert|773|m}}.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{wwdb name|id=7|name=Mongefossen}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Unfortunately, as is the case with many of [[Norway]]&amp;apos;s tallest waterfalls, it has been targeted for [[hydroelectric]] power, which results in a greatly diminished water flow during the summer tourist season.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;snl&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Mongefossen|title=Mongefossen|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2010-10-27}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Mongefossen also holds the distinction as being the highest waterfall in the world which may be viewed from a [[railway station]]. In this case, they are located on the famous [[Rauma Line|Rauma Railway]], on the north side of the tracks between the villages of Flatmark and Marstein.
