The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Monkey Sanctuary&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was founded in 1964 by Len Williams, father of  [[John Williams (guitarist)]], as a [[cooperative]] to care for rescued [[woolly monkey]]s.  Based in [[Looe]], [[Cornwall]], [[England]], the sanctuary is home to woolly monkeys that are descended from the original rescued pets, a growing number of [[capuchin monkeys]] rescued from the current UK pet trade,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bbc&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web

There is a colony of rare [[lesser horseshoe bat]]s living in the cellar of Murrayton House, a 19th century building that is the visitors&amp;apos; centre and accommodation for staff and volunteers. The bats can be observed from the &amp;quot;bat cave&amp;quot;, a room that shows CCTV footage from an infrared camera installed in the cellar.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web
