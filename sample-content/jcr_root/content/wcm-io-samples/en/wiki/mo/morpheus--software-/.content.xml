&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Morpheus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[file sharing]] and searching [[peer-to-peer]] client for [[Microsoft Windows]], developed and distributed by the company [[StreamCast Networks|StreamCast]], that originally used the [[Opennap]] protocol, but later supported many different peer-to-peer protocols.  On April 22, 2008, distributor StreamCast Networks filed for Chapter 7 [[bankruptcy]] after a long legal battle with music companies; all of their employees were laid off and the official download at www.morpheus.com stopped being available, though for a small period the website remained online. As of October 29, 2008 the official Morpheus website is offline, including all other websites owned by StreamCast Networks, specifically MusicCity.com, Streamcastnetworks.com, and NeoNetwork.com.

==Download restriction==
Currently, Morpheus redirects a user attempting to download unauthorized copyrighted music and movie files to a site with purchase links for music.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

== Availability ==
Users of the Morpheus community have set up a website (at [[Gnutella]]Forums.com) where the Morpheus software can still be downloaded. At that site, there is a support [[internet forum|forum]] and support [[chat room]] setup from the [http://www.gnutellaforums.com/morpheus-windows/91786-clean-updated-morpheus-installers-available-here.html site] and within the client.

==Presence of adware/spyware==
The current version of Morpheus, version 5.5.1, contains no [[adware]] or [[spyware]], and no additional software is bundled with Morpheus. However, when Morpheus is open and running, the interface contains online ads that used to support the application.

During installation, an optional peer-to-peer Morpheus [[Toolbar]] is offered.  Both the Morpheus application and the Morpheus Toolbar can be easily uninstalled with Windows Add/Remove Programs commands, however this was not the case with previous versions.

Version 5.3 didn&amp;apos;t install adware or spyware, though it did install some Desktop shortcuts to adware websites and the Morpheus Toolbar without user approval.

==In popular culture==
*[[&amp;quot;Weird Al&amp;quot; Yankovic|Weird Al]] mentions Morpheus in [[Don&amp;apos;t Download This Song]].
