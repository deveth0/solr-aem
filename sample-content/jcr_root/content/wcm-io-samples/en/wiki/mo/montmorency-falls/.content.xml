The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Montmorency Falls&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-fr|Chute Montmorency}}) are a large [[waterfall]] on the [[Montmorency River]] in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web

&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The falls are located on the boundary between the borough of [[Beauport, Quebec City]], and [[Boischatel, Quebec|Boischatel]], about 12&amp;amp;nbsp;km from the heart of old [[Quebec City]]. The area surrounding the falls is protected within the Montmorency Falls Park ({{lang-fr|Parc de la Chute-Montmorency}}).

The falls, at 84 meters (275 ft) high and 46 meters (150 ft) wide, are the highest in the province of Quebec and 30 meters (98 ft) higher than [[Niagara Falls]]. The basin at the foot of the falls is 17 meters (56 ft) deep. The falls are at the mouth of the Montmorency River where it drops over the [[cliff]] shore into the [[Saint Lawrence River]], opposite the western end of the [[Île d&amp;apos;Orleans, Quebec|Île d&amp;apos;Orleans]]. The falls were given this name in 1613 by [[Samuel de Champlain]]. He named them in honour of Henri II, [[duc de Montmorency]], who served as viceroy of [[New France]] from 1620 until 1625.

There are staircases that allow visitors to view the falls from several different perspectives.  A [[suspension bridge]] over the crest of the falls provides access to both sides of the park as well as a spectacular view.  There is also an [[Aerial tramway|aerial tram]] ([[Funitel]]) that carries passengers between the base and the top of the falls. In the summer the park hosts an international [[fireworks]] competition with the falls as a backdrop.

The remnants of earthen forts built by [[James Wolfe|General Wolfe]] are located in the eastern portion of the park. They were constructed in 1759. The landings below Quebec City were repulsed by [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm|General Montcalm]] at Montmorency Falls, costing the British 440 soldiers. Ultimately a successful assault was launched when Wolfe made a surprise attack by climbing the cliffs below the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Plains of Abraham]].

The Falls were the site of a key scene between the lead actors in the 1947 film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Whispering City]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was filmed on location.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;imdb_whispering_city&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{IMDb title|0039986|Whispering City}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;internet_archive_whispering_city&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/WhisperingCity|title=Whispering City (1947)|accessdate=2012-01-19}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The [[Ice Hotel (Québec)|Ice Hotel]] was located at Montmorency Falls for its first year.

In his poem &amp;quot;[[Sleep and Poetry]]&amp;quot; (1816), [[John Keats]] says that human life is &amp;quot;a poor Indian&amp;apos;s sleep / While his boat hastens to the monstrous steep / Of Montmorenci.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.bartleby.com/126/31.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
