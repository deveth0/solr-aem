A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;monolithic church&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;rock-hewn church&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[church (building)|church]] made from a single block of [[Rock (geology)|stone]]. The churches are usually hewn into the ground or into the side of a hill or mountain{{why|date=May 2013}} and can be of comparable architectural complexity to constructed buildings.

==Ethiopia==
The term &amp;quot;monolithic church&amp;quot; is most often used to refer to the complex of 11 churches in [[Lalibela]], [[Ethiopia]], believed to have been created in the 12th century. These churches are the Church of the Redeemer, of Saint Mary, of Mount Sinai, of Golgotha, of the House of the Cross, of the House of the Virgins, of Saint Gabriel, of Abba Matta, of Saint Mercurius, of Immanuel. The most famous of them is the cross-shaped [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela|Church of St. George]] (Beta Giyorgis). Tradition credits its construction to [[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela|King Lalibela]], who was a devout Christian. The medieval monolithic churches of this 12th-century &amp;apos;New Jerusalem&amp;apos; are situated in a mountainous region in the heart of Ethiopia near a traditional village. Lalibela is an important center of Ethiopian Christianity, and even today is a place of pilgrimage and devotion. Lalibela is one of the world&amp;apos;s precious heritages registered by UNESCO.

Many other churches were hewn from rock in Ethiopia, outside of Lalibela. This practice was very common in [[Tigray Region|Tigray]], where the outside world knew of only a few such churches until the [[Roman Catholicism in Ethiopia|Catholic]] priest Abba Tewelde Medhin Josief presented a paper to the Third International Conference of Ethiopian Studies in which he announced the existence of over 120 churches, 90 of which were still in use.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ghelawdewos Araia, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://www.africanidea.org/magnificent_aksum.html The Magnificence of Aksum: Revisiting Ethiopian Civilization]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Despite Dr. Josief&amp;apos;s death soon after his presentation, research over the next few years raised the total number of these rock-hewn churches to 153.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Philip Briggs, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ethiopia: The Bradt Travel Guide&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 5th edition (Chalfont St Peters: Bradt, 2002), p. 278&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

There are a number of monolithic churches elsewhere in the world.  However, none have the free-standing external walls of the Lalibela churches and more closely resemble [[cave monastery|cave monasteries]] in that they consist of tunnels into a single rock.  Examples include:

* The [[Geghard]] monastery, [[Armenia]]
* The [[Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo]], [[Bulgaria]] near [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]]
* St. Jean Church in [[Aubeterre-sur-Dronne]], [[France]]
* Church in [[Saint-Ã‰milion]], France
* [[Temppeliaukio Church]] in Helsinki, [[Finland]]
* The rock churches in [[Cappadocia]], [[Turkey]] which number beyond one thousand and contain some superb examples of [[Byzantine]] wall-paintings, representing both the academic classicizing trend in Byzantine art, and some archaic popular styles
