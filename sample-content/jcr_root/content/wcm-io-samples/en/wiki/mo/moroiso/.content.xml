&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Moroiso&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (諸磯) is the name of an inlet in the [[Miura Peninsula]] south of [[Tokyo]] in [[Japan]].

== Prehistory ==
Moroiso was settled by [[Jōmon]] people by at least 3,000 BCE. Evidence from that period have been found, including sedentary to semi-sedentary housing, [[pottery]], stone tools and fishing implements. Moroiso became the archeological name for the Early [[Jōmon]] period of Japanese prehistory corresponding to the Moroiso pottery style, dated to around 5.000 years before present. The Moroiso period also coincides with the [[Holocene climatic optimum|hypsithermal interval]], the warmest period since the last [[glaciation]], when sea levels were around 6 meters higher than today.

==History==
During historic times, the rugged and hilly Moroiso coastline, together with the adjoining [[Aburatsubo]] inlet, was selected by the feudal [[Miura clan]] to build a series of fortifications, with the [[Arai castle]] at its center. During the warring period of [[Sengoku]], the castle fell after a 3 year siege to the rival [[Late Hōjō clan|Hōjō]] samurai family, in the year 1516. The Hōjō later managed to unify most of the [[Kantō region|Kantō]] area around [[Tokyo]].

==World War II==

Late of the [[Second World War]] in 1945, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] selected the Misaki Marine Biological Station of the [[University of Tokyo]] at Moroiso as training school and harbour for a fleet of [[Kamikaze]] [[midget submarine]]s, the [[Kairyu class submarine|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kairyu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] (海龍 &amp;quot;Sea Dragons&amp;quot;).[http://www.mmbs.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/overview/history/history3.html] They were supposed to be employed in [[suicide bombing]] missions against the [[US Navy]] ships during its final approach to [[Tokyo]], but the war ended before any of them could see action.

After the war, the facility was returned to the university and is still visible today.

== Today ==

Moroiso harbours a small fishing community and a few hundred pleasure boats on moorings or stored on the ground. With the neighbouring [[Aburatsubo]] inlet, Moroiso has been considered as the birthplace of modern recreational [[sailing]] in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Due to the lack of space on the water inside the inlet itself, many boats are stored on the ground, typically using an adapted [[forklift]] system which allows to put on the water boats up to 40&amp;amp;nbsp;ft, in a matter of minutes.
