{{Cookbook|Monterey Jack Cheese}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Monterey Jack&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an American semihard [[cheese]], customarily of pale yellow color, made using cow&amp;apos;s milk. It is commonly sold by itself, or mixed with [[Colby (cheese)|Colby]] to make a marbled cheese known as [[Colby-Jack|Colby-Jack (or Co-Jack)]]. [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]]-Jack varieties are also available.

In its earliest form, Monterey Jack was made by the [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[Franciscan]] friars of [[Monterey, California]], during the 19th century. [[California]] businessman [[David Jack (businessman)|David Jack]] sold the cheese commercially. He produced a mild, white cheese, which came to be known as &amp;quot;Jack&amp;apos;s Cheese&amp;quot;, and eventually &amp;quot;Monterey Jack&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=Why do Pirates Love Parrots? An Imponderables Books|last= Feldman|first= David|authorlink= David Feldman (author)|year= 2006|publisher= Collins|location= New York|isbn= 0-06-088842-3|pages= 53â€“55}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

A common misspelling is &amp;quot;Monterrey&amp;quot; Jack, presumably in confusion with the Mexican city of [[Monterrey]].

==Aging==
Most of the softer types generally found in American markets are [[cheese ripening|aged]] for only one month, while another variety of Monterey Jack is aged for up to six months.

==Variants==
An aged version of this cheese, known as Dry Jack, can be churned or grated and used much like [[Parmesan cheese]]. Dry Jack was originally created by accident in 1915 when a San Francisco cheese wholesaler stored and forgot a number of wheels of fresh Jack cheese&amp;lt;ref name=sfgate /&amp;gt;. When shipments of hard cheese from Europe were subsequently interrupted as [[World War I]] intensified, he rediscovered the stored Jack, which had become a well-aged hard cheese his customers found to be a good substitute for classic, aged hard cheeses such as [[Parmesan]].&amp;lt;ref name=sfgate&amp;gt;[http://articles.sfgate.com/1995-09-27/food/17816429_1_cheese-dry-jack-chefs Dry Monterey Jack Cheese: What&amp;apos;s Old Is New Again]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Another version called [[Pepper jack cheese|pepper jack]] mixes [[Chile pepper|hot peppers]] with Monterey Jack. Pepper jack is often used as an alternative cheese in dishes such as [[quesadilla]]s, but can be eaten with bread or crackers as a snack.  Other versions are flavored with garlic or pesto, though they are less common than pepper jack.

==Health impact==
Because of its low content of [[tyramine]], an organic compound thought to be associated with [[headaches]],&amp;lt;ref name=mednet&amp;gt;[http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=56109 Headaches from Food: The Connection&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; it is frequently recommended as one of the few cheeses that is safe to eat for [[migraine]] sufferers.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}
