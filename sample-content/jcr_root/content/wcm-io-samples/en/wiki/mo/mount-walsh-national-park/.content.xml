&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mount Walsh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a national park in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], 230&amp;amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Brisbane]].

A prominent landmark in the Biggenden region is the granite bluff area of Mount Walsh which rises to 703&amp;amp;nbsp;m above sea leven in the northern part of park. The summit has three peaks.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;naq&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=Natural Areas of Queensland |last=Shilton |first=Peter |year=2005 |publisher=Goldpress |location=Mount Gravatt, Queensland |isbn=0-9758275-0-2 |pages=140–141 |accessdate=28 June 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Exposed granite outcrops, rugged ridges and steep forested slopes support a range of vegetation.

The “Bluff” area of Mount Walsh is located at the park’s northern end and is a prominent landmark of the Biggenden area.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;dermmwnp&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.derm.qld.gov.au/parks/mount-walsh/index.html |title=Mount Walsh National Park |date=9 June 2011 |publisher=Department of Environment and Resource Management |accessdate=28 June 2011 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The park features sheltered gullies, rugged ridge lines with mountain areas with spectacular exposed granite outcrops and cliffs support a diversity of vegetation. Such diversity gives a home to many endangered animal species such as the [[Powerful Owl]] and [[Grey Goshawk]]. Visitors may also see [[Peregrine Falcon]]s, [[Dingo]]es, [[wallaby|Wallabies]], [[Eastern Grey Kangaroo]]s and [[Lace Monitor]]s.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;naq&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

A complex landscape has led to diverse vegetation communities which includes heath, shrubland, woodland, open forest and dry forest.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;naq&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; There are patches of [[Hoop Pine]]s in some gullies.

==Geology==
The geological history of the mountain began in the late Triassic period about 215 million years ago. Violent explosions emanated from a volcanic structure referred to as the Mungore Centre.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;naq&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Two large bodies of [[magma]] rose close to the surface where Mount Malarga and Mount Walsh are presently situated. Erosion has left the cliffs, buffs, gorges rocky pavements and tors seen today.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;naq&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Facilities==
Picnic and barbecue facilities are available.  Bush camping is allowed in the park.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;dermmwnp&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; No facilities are provided so visitors must be totally self-sufficient.

===Walking tracks===
A 300&amp;amp;nbsp;metre trail from the picnic area leads visitors through open eucalypt forest to a rocky creek gully fringed in rain forest,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;qhmwnp&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queenslandholidays.com.au/things-to-see-and-do/mount-walsh-national-park/index.cfm |title=Things to do and see: Mount Walsh National Park|work=Queensland Holidays |publisher=Tourism Queensland |accessdate=28 June 2011 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; then on to lookouts over surrounding countryside.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;dermmwnp&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Experienced walkers can take the strenuous (unmarked) two and a half hour hike to Mount Walsh&amp;apos;s bare granite summit.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;dermmwnp&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; You will be rewarded with stunning views.
