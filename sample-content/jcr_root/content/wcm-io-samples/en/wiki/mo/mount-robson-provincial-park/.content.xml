&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mount Robson Provincial Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a large provincial park in the [[Canadian Rockies]] with an area of 2,249 km². The park is located entirely within [[British Columbia]], bordering [[Jasper National Park]] in [[Alberta]]. The B.C. legislature created the park in 1913, the same year as the first ascent of [[Mount Robson]] by a party led by [[Conrad Kain]]. The park is named for Mount Robson, which has the highest point in the Canadian Rockies and is located entirely within the park.

The first recreational trail was built in 1913 by Jasper outfitter Donald &amp;quot;Curly&amp;quot; Phillips along the [[Robson River]] to [[Berg Lake]].

From May to September, a visitor centre is open just south of the Mt. Robson Viewpoint on the [[Yellowhead Highway]]. The only services within the park are at a combination coffee-shop gas station complex at the Viewpoint.

To reach the park, follow the [[Yellowhead Highway]] 390 kilometres west of [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] or 290 kilometres east of [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]].&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;clear:left;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
