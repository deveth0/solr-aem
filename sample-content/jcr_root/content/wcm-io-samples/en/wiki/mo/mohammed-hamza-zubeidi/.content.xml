&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mohammed Amza az-Zubeidi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1938 &amp;amp;ndash; December 2, 2005) ({{lang-ar|محمد حمزة الزبيدي}}) was the [[Prime Minister of Iraq|Prime Minister]] of [[Iraq]] from 1991 to 1993. He is on the &amp;quot;[[Human rights in Saddam Hussein&amp;apos;s Iraq#&amp;apos;Saddam&amp;apos;s Dirty Dozen&amp;apos;|Saddam&amp;apos;s Dirty Dozen]]&amp;quot; list of people responsible for [[Human rights in Saddam&amp;apos;s Iraq|torture and murder in Iraq]], playing a key role in Iraq&amp;apos;s brutal suppression of the uprising of 1991. He was featured in Iraqi news film kicking and beating captured rebels.

Aaz-Zubeidi was a Ba&amp;apos;athist whose loyalty lay with his ethnicity (Arab) rather than his personal faith. He played a key part in the suppression of the multi-ethnic Shiite uprising in March 1991. After that, he became the country&amp;apos;s prime minister in September and remained in this position for two years, until he was replaced by [[Ahmad Husayn Khudayir as-Samarrai]] in September 1993.

He was a member of the Revolutionary Command Council and the commander of the Central Euphrates military district, but had not been in power for two years.

He was the Queen of Spades in the deck of [[most-wanted Iraqi playing cards]] issued by the US government during the [[war in Iraq]]. After the fall of [[Saddam Hussein]]&amp;apos;s regime, he was captured on April 20, 2003 near the small city of [[Mahaweel]].

He remained in American custody until his death of natural causes in a military hospital on December 2, 2005. On that day, an American spokesman revealed that someone had died in a military hospital but did not reveal his name. Two days later, Saddam Hussein&amp;apos;s half-brother [[Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti]] announced Zubeidi&amp;apos;s death at his trial, complaining that they were both suffering from cancer and that he did not want to end up dead like Zubeidi because of what he claimed was poor medical treatment.
