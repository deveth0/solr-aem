&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Montreuil&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Montreuil-sur-Mer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-fr|mɔ̃tʁœj syʁ mɛʁ}}) is a [[Subprefectures in France|sub-prefecture]] in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] [[Departments of France|department]] in northern [[France]]. It is located on the [[Canche]] river, not far from [[Étaples]]. The sea, however, is now some distance away.

==Sights==
It is surrounded by medieval ramparts, part of the reinforcement work of the famed French military engineer [[Vauban]] from his fortification of northern France in the 17th century.

==Demographics==
Population (1999): 2,688 inhabitants for the city, 21,603 inhabitants for the canton and 99,288 inhabitants for the arrondissement.

==History==

Montreuil was the headquarters of the [[British Army]] in France during the [[First World War]]. [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|General Haig]] was quartered in the nearby [[Château de Beaurepaire]]. A statue commemorating his stay can be seen outside the theatre on the Place Charles de Gaulle. During the German occupation of the town during the Second World War, the statue was taken down. It was never found and is thought to have been melted down. It was rebuilt in the 1950s, using the sculptor&amp;apos;s original mould.

==Literature==
[[Lawrence Sterne]] visited the town in 1765. He recounted his visit through the eyes of the narrator of his novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1768).

Montreuil is the setting for part of [[Victor Hugo]]&amp;apos;s novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Les Misérables]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, where it is identified only as M____-sur-M__ in past translations. Hugo had spent several vacations in Montreuil.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Edward Behr, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Complete Book of Les Misérables&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Arcade, 1993), 29&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
