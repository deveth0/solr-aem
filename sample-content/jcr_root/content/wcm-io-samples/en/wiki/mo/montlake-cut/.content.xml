The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Montlake Cut&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the easternmost section of the [[Lake Washington Ship Canal]], which passes through the [[city]] of [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], linking [[Lake Washington]] to [[Puget Sound]]. It is approximately {{convert|2500|ft|m}} long and {{convert|350|ft|m}} wide. The center channel is {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|30|ft|m}} deep.

The Cut provides a connection between [[Union Bay (Seattle, Washington)|Union Bay]], part of Lake Washington, to the east and [[Portage Bay]], an arm of [[Lake Union]], to the west. It is spanned by the [[Montlake Bridge]], a [[Bascule bridge|bascule]] [[drawbridge]] carrying Montlake Boulevard ([[Washington State Route 513|State Route 513]]). Most of the land on the north shore of the Cut is occupied by the [[University of Washington]], its medical school to the west and its stadium parking lot to the east; residences and a recreational trail occupy the south bank, which is part of the [[Montlake, Seattle, Washington|Montlake]] neighborhood. It is the site of the annual [[Windermere Cup]] [[Sport rowing|crew regatta]] and the Seattle [[Yacht]] Club&amp;apos;s Opening Day Boat Parade, both of which take place on the first Saturday in May.

The Montlake Cut&amp;apos;s original name was Erickson Cut. Contractor C.J. Erickson commenced the big project in turning on his big [[steam shovel]] in celebration of the October 27, 1909, post AYP Exposition era,in the final push to complete the Lake Washington Canal project. At the ceremony were Judge Roger S. Greene, Judge Thomas Burke, J.S. Brace and John H. McGraw who turned the first shovel of dirt that day.

The [[Duwamish tribe|Duwamish]] called the area &amp;quot;Carry a Canoe&amp;quot; ([[Lushootseed]]: sxWÃ¡tSadweehL). Indigenous people had been portaging between the lakes for centuries, either carrying canoes or shoving them along an intermittent creek that appeared when Lake Washington overflowed.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |last= Thrush |first= Coll |title= Native Seattle: Histories from the Crossing-Over Place |year= 2007 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 0-295-98700-6 |pages= 251}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
