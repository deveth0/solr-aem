[[File:Moleskin.jpg|thumb|German moleskin]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Moleskin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a heavy [[cotton]] [[textile|fabric]], woven and then sheared to create a short, soft [[Pile (textile)|pile]] on one side. The word is also used for clothing made from this fabric, as well as adhesive pads stuck to the skin to prevent [[blisters]].

Clothing made from moleskin is noted for its softness and durability. Some variants of the cloth are so densely woven as to be windproof.

The fabric, in a grayish [[olive-drab]] color, was used for West German Army (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bundeswehr]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) uniforms from the 1960s until the early 1990s, when it was replaced by a [[polyester]]-[[cotton]] blend [[twill]] printed with a [[camouflage]] pattern called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Flecktarn]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. German moleskin was not sheared and thus had a flat, smooth outer side, differing from British moleskin. It was nonetheless a tough, densely woven material strongly resistant against wind and abrasion. Its chief weakness was its weight and lack of water resistance.

Moleskin can be coated with an adhesive backing and used to prevent or treat friction injuries of the feet. In the case of a blister, the moleskin is cut with a hole in the center so the fabric does not adhere to the blister directly. The thickness of the surrounding moleskin protects the blister from further friction.

Cotton &amp;quot;sateen&amp;quot; is a variant of moleskin.  It utilizes cheaper short-strand cotton to create a softer feeling fabric that is relatively fragile and wears quickly.
