A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;monocular&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a modified [[refracting telescope]] used to [[magnify]] the images of distant objects by passing light through a series of [[lens (optics)|lenses]] and sometimes [[Prism (optics)|prism]]s; the use of prisms results in a [[mass|lightweight]] telescope.  Volume and weight are less than half those of [[binoculars]] of similar optical properties, making it easy to carry. Monoculars produce 2-[[dimension]]al images, while binoculars add perception of depth (3 dimensions).

A monocular with a straight [[optical path]] is relatively long; prisms can be used to fold the optical path to make an instrument which is much shorter (see the article on [[binoculars]] for details).

Monoculars, sometimes called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;telescopes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; when used in this capacity, are used wherever a magnified 2-dimensional image of a distant object is required (Though some may be used to look at objects closer).

[[Visually impaired people]] may use monoculars to see objects at distances at which people with normal vision do not have difficulty, e.g., to read text on a [[chalkboard]] or [[projection screen]]. Applications for viewing more distant objects include [[natural history]], [[hunting]], [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and [[military]] applications.

When high magnification, a bright image, and good resolution of distant images are required, a relatively large instrument is preferred, often mounted on a [[tripod]]. Smaller pocket-sized &amp;quot;pocket scopes&amp;quot; can be used for less stringent applications.
