&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mohale&amp;apos;s Hoek&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the capital city of [[Mohale&amp;apos;s Hoek District]] in [[Lesotho]]. It had a population of approximately 24,992 in 2006.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Lesotho Bureau of Statistics, [http://www.bos.gov.ls/Census_Pre_Results_2006.htm Census Pre Results] 2006.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mohale&amp;apos;s Hoek&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; had first been inhabited by the [[Bushmen|San]] who were found there by the [[Baphuthi]] around 1795. The Baphuthi settled in [[Kubake]] near the present [[Likuena High School]] while some settled at [[Thaba-Ts&amp;apos;oeu]]. [[Chief Moorosi]] of the Baphuthi is said to have been there during the journey to this new home. They later settled below the foothills of [[Thaba-Linoha]], north of the present Bethesda mission and the area was later called [[Maphutseng]]. Some Baphuthi inhabited the area bordering [[Senqu River]], [[Morifi]] and across the river into what is now [[Quthing]]. After 1824, the area was inhabited by [[Mohale]], the younger brother of [[Moshoeshoe I|Moshoeshoe]] around the 1830s.

On expansion of Moshoeshoe&amp;apos;s kingdom into southern Lesotho, [[Moshoeshoe I|King Moshoeshoe]] sent his brother [[Mohale]] to administer the area where the Baphuthi and [[Basotho]] enjoyed a rather fragile friendship. After living for a while at [[Lifateng]], Mohale established a substantial village at the place now known as [[Old Hoek]] (the present day [[Ha Ts&amp;apos;epo]] village) a few kilometres north of the present town. This village was destroyed in 1867 during the [[Seqiti War]] and was subsequently abandoned. In the year after the proclamation that made Lesotho British territory, an assistant commissioner was appointed to administer what was then called [[Cornet Spruit District]] - after the [[Makhaleng River]]. This would make Mohale&amp;apos;s Hoek the second oldest of all the district headquarters towns in Lesotho, except that the town was completely destroyed during the [[Gun War]] of 1880. East to the town near the St Patrick&amp;apos;s Cathedral are the [[Motlejoeng caves]] which were used by the celebrated cannibal, Motlejoa during the [[Lifaqane]].
