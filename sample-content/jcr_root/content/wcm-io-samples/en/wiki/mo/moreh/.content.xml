[[File:Givatamore.jpg|250px|thumb|right|&amp;quot;Givet Hamoreh&amp;quot; (Moreh hill) south of [[Mount Tabor]]]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Moreh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a name of a location, commonly used in the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].

==Torah locality==

Translators who consider the obscure &amp;apos;&amp;apos;elon moreh&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of Genesis 12:6 to be the name of a locality, render it as &amp;quot;the plains of Moreh&amp;quot;. Translators who consider the term to be a sacred tree or grove, often render it &amp;quot;[[terebinth]]&amp;quot;, a tree notable for its size and age in dry landscapes of the region. The noble terebinth is a member of the [[pistachio]] and [[sumac]] family. Thus for them, at [[Shechem]], grew the [[terebinth]]s, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;elone moreh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: &amp;quot;Abraham passed through the land as far as the site of Shechem, at the Terebinths of Moreh. The Caananites were then in the land&amp;quot; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Genesis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 12:6). This tree or grove, with a name that must mean &amp;quot;teacher,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;oracle&amp;quot; was a landmark in the area called the &amp;quot;plains of Moreh&amp;quot; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Deuteronomy&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 11:30) or the &amp;quot;hill of Moreh&amp;quot; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Judges&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 7:1).

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Genesis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 35:4: And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which [were] in their hand, and [all their] earrings which [were] in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which [was] by Shechem. A neutral reading discovers that the tree, oak or not, grew above buried idols and dedicated treasure, the Hebrews remembered, and they associated the burial of these things with the [[patriarchal age]].

The site of Moreh, a hill by which [[Gideon]] camped before he attacked the Midianites, is sometimes identified with modern [[Nebi Dahi]], Israel, south of [[Mount Tabor]] but this has not been confirmed on the ground.
