&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mooney&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a family name, which is probably predominantly derived from the Irish Ó Maonaigh. It can also be spelled Moony, Moonie, [[Meaney]] and Meeney.

==Origins==
The origin of the different Moony or Mooney families is lost in antiquity. The name is derived from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;maoin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; a [[irish language|gaelic]] word meaning &amp;apos;&amp;apos;wealth&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;treasure of treasure&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, hence when O&amp;apos;Maonaigh was anglicised to Mooney it meant &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the descendant of the wealthy one.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.irishmidlandsancestry.com/content/family_history/families/mooney_doon.htm ]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

According to Irish lore, the Mooney family comes from one of the largest and most noble Irish lines. They are said to be descendants of the ancient Irish King [[Érimón|Heremon]], who, along with his brother Herber, conquered Ireland.  Heremon slew his brother shortly after their invasion, took the throne for himself, and fathered a line of kings of Ireland that include [[Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill|Malachi II]], and [[Niall of the Nine Hostages|King Niall]] of the Nine Hostages.

Baptismal records, parish records, ancient land grants, the [[Annals of the Four Masters]], and books by [[John O&amp;apos;Hart|O&amp;apos;Hart]], [[Edward MacLysaght|McLysaght]], and [[O&amp;apos;Brien]] were all used in researching the history of the Mooney family name. These varied and often ancient records indicate that distant septs of the name arose in several places throughout Ireland. The most known and most numerous sept came from the county of [[County Offaly|Offaly]]. The members of this sept were from Chieftain Monach, son of Ailill Mor, Lord of [[Ulster]], who was descended from the Kings of [[Connacht]]. These family members gave their name to town lands called Ballymooney both in that county and in the neighboring county of [[Leix]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|author=HJK49 &amp;amp;nbsp;(Visualizza annunci) |url=http://boards.ancestry.it/surnames.mooney/2092/mb.ashx |title=The Ancient and Distinguished History of the - Mooney - Bacheca di storia familiare e genealogia - Ancestry.it |publisher=Boards.ancestry.it |date=2009-02-23 |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
