&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Southwest Finland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Finland Proper&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-fi|Varsinais-Suomi}}, {{lang-sv|Egentliga Finland}}, {{lang-la|Ducatus Finlandiae Meridionalis}}), is a [[Historical provinces of Finland|historical province]] in south western [[Finland]], centred on the historic city of [[Turku]] (Swedish: Åbo) and the [[Turku Castle]]. It borders [[Satakunta (historical province)|Satakunta]], [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]] and [[Uusimaa]]. It is also bounded by the [[Baltic sea]] facing [[Åland]]. There is also a modern [[Regions of Finland|region]] by the name [[Finland Proper (region)|Finland Proper]]. Finland Proper is not to be confused with [[Mainland Finland]].

== Administration ==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Southwest Finland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was comprised within the boundaries of the administrative province of [[Turku and Pori Province|Turku and Pori]] from 1917 to 1997 and that of [[Western Finland]] from 1997 to 2009, when the provinces of Finland were abolished.

== History ==
The province, which had been a part of [[Sweden]] from the 13th century, separated when Finland was ceded to [[Russia]] in 1809. The [[Provinces of Sweden|provinces]] has no administrative function today but lives on as a historical legacy in both countries. Originally &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Finland&amp;apos;&amp;apos; referred only to this region but later replaced the traditional [[Österland]] (Eastern land) in meaning.

== Heraldry ==
Arms granted at the burial of [[Gustav I of Sweden]] in 1560. The arms is crowned by a ducal coronet, though by Finnish tradition this more resembles a Swedish comital coronet. Blazon: &amp;quot;Gules, a crowned jousting helmet in front of two lances in saltire, all Or. On each lance is attached a forked hanging flag azure, charged with a Scandinavian cross Or.&amp;quot;
