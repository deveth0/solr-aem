&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fidel Sánchez Hernández&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (July 7, 1917 in [[El Divisadero]]&amp;amp;ndash; February 28, 2003) was a politician, general, and former [[President of El Salvador|President]] of [[El Salvador]]. It could be said that Sánchez Hernández led his country during a tumultuous era. While ruling El Salvador from 1967 to 1972, Sánchez Hernández faced war and economic turmoil.

Before becoming president, Sánchez Hernández was an army general in El Salvador and had brief stints as a [[military attaché]] in Washington (after his participation in the overthrow of [[José María Lemus]] in 1960) and in Paris. President [[Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo|Julio Adalberto Rivera]] promoted him to [[Minister of the Interior]] in 1962, and he served in that office until 1967, when he succeeded Rivera to the position of president. He continued Rivera&amp;apos;s progressive programs and created a mostly civilian cabinet. The [[Salvadoran presidential election, 1967|1967 election]] was considered the one of the few in the period of military domination to have been fairly conducted, indeed the gains made by the opposition (winning in fact a majority of the popular vote) in the [[Salvadoran legislative election, 1968|legislative and local elections]] the following year suggested El Salvador was on the road to democratisation, a trend that would not be continued as elections in the 1970s were blatantly rigged.

In July 1969 Sánchez Hernández led the Salvadoran army in its brief but violent  [[Football War]] against [[Honduras]].  He had much success, occupying a large part of that country.  But, under a cease-fire agreement arranged by the [[Organization of American States]], Sánchez Hernández agreed to pull his troops out, much to the opposition of many of his military leaders.

The war with Honduras led to much economic distress in El Salvador.  Refugees, mostly Salvadorans that resided in Honduras, poured into the country and Honduras closed off trade routes.

Sánchez Hernández remained president until 1972 and was succeeded by Colonel [[Arturo Armando Molina]].

On the night of February 28, 2003, Sánchez Hernández, aged 85, died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while being taken to a military hospital in El Salvador.
