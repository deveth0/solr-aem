The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Five College Radio Astronomical Observatory&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;FCRAO&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was a [[radio astronomy]] [[observatory]] located on a [[peninsula]] in the [[Quabbin Reservoir]].  It was sited in the town of [[New Salem, Massachusetts]] on land that was originally part of [[Prescott, Massachusetts]].  It was founded in 1969 by the [[Five Colleges (Massachusetts)|Five College]] [[Astronomy]] Department ([[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] (UMass), [[Amherst College]], [[Hampshire College]], [[Mount Holyoke College]] and [[Smith College]]).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;fcraogeneral&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.umass.edu/~fcrao/telescope/|title=FCRAO General Information|publisher=Astronomy Department at the University of Massachusetts|accessdate=2011-11-13}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  From its inception, the [[observatory]] has emphasized [[research]], the development of technology and the training of students&amp;amp;mdash;both [[graduate school|graduate]] and [[undergraduate]].

The initial FCRAO [[telescope]] was a customized low-frequency [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] to search for [[pulsar]]s in the [[Milky Way Galaxy|galaxy]]. The development of instrumentation within the FCRAO labs contributed to the discovery of the [[binary pulsar]] system [[PSR B1913+16]] by [[Joseph Hooton Taylor Jr.|Joseph Taylor]] and [[Russell Hulse]], for which they received the 1993 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].  It was replaced by a 14-meter [[radome|radome-enclosed]] [[Extremely high frequency|millimeter-wave]] telescope in 1976.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;fcraostatus&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.umass.edu/~fcrao/observer/status14m.html|title=FCRAO 14-m Status|publisher=Astronomy Department at the University of Massachusetts|accessdate=2011-11-13}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Decommissioning ==

After UMass Amherst devoted its time, energy, and funding to the [[Large Millimeter Telescope]] (LMT) from approximately 2005, FCRAO was described as being the thenâ€“&amp;quot;current platform&amp;quot;, with the LMT referred to as its &amp;quot;future platform&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;fcraogeneral&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  On July 21, 2011, the [[Massachusetts Water Resources Authority]] announced that the telescope and the associated control building were removed from the site.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;fcraodecon&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwra.state.ma.us/01news/2011/072111-observatory.html|title=MWRA Historic Observatory at Quabbin Decommissioned|publisher=Massachusetts Water Resources Authority|accessdate=2011-11-13}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
