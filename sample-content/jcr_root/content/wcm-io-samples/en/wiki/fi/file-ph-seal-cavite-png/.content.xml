* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;No free equivalent.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Being a seal or a Philippine local government unit (LGU), there is obviously no free equivalent.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Resolution/fidelity.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; The seal is of a low resolution such that reproduction in other contexts, such as print publication, is not feasible.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Respect for commercial opportunities.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Since this is a seal of a Philippine LGU, there are no commercial opportunities allowed for the use of the seal by the LGU, the copyright holder. Its use in Wikipedia does not infringe on any commercial opportunities.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Content&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Significance.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; The purpose of a Philippine LGU seal is chiefly to identify the LGU (such as on the facade of the LGU&amp;apos;s buildings) and to authenticate official documents when stamped onto them. The usage of the seal in Wikipedia follows this mandate as a means of visual identification of the LGU in appropriate contexts such as in the LGU&amp;apos;s article and templates, and in the articles of encompassing or constituent LGUs.
