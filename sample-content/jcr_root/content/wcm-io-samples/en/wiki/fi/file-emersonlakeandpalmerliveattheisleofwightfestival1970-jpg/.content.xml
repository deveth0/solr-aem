| Source         =
*Derived from a scan of the album cover (creator of this digital version is irrelevant as the copyright in all equivalent images is still held by the same party). Copyright held by the record company or the artist.  Claimed as fair use regardless.

# This image is a low-resolution image of an album cover.
# This image does not limit the copyright holder&amp;apos;s ability to profit from the original source, nor will it dilute the importance or recognition of the album or the artist  in connection with its organization.
# This image enhances the article in which it&amp;apos;s displayed, as it provides an immediate relevance to the reader more capably than the textual description alone.
#Use of the album cover visually identifies the album and the artist and its products in a manner that mere prose cannot, and meets all criteria in [[WP:NFCC]].
| Replaceability = Not replaceable; album covers are always presumed non-free.
