&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;General elections&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were held in [[Fiji]] between 23 and 30 May 1992.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Nohlen, D, Grotz, F &amp;amp; Hartmann, C (2001) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume II&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p653 ISBN 0-19-924959-8&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  It was the first election held since two [[Fiji coups of 1987|military coups]] in 1987 had severed Fiji&amp;apos;s 113-year old constitutional links with the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Monarchy]], and later [[Queen of Fiji|Fijian Monarchy]], and ushered in a republic.

The 1992 elections were the first to be held under the new electoral system, which was deliberately biased in favour of [[Fijian people|ethnic Fijians]].  &amp;quot;National&amp;quot; constituencies, elected by universal suffrage and comprising approximately half of the [[House of Representatives (Fiji)|House of Representatives]] under the 1970 constitution, were abolished, and for the first time, all members of the House of Representatives were elected from &amp;quot;communal&amp;quot; constituencies on closed [[electoral roll]]s, for registered members of a particular ethnic group.  37 seats were allocated to ethnic Fijians and only 27 to [[Indo-Fijians]], despite the near-equality of their numbers in the population; one seat was reserved for a representative of the [[Rotuma|Rotuman Islanders]], with five &amp;quot;general electorates&amp;quot; set aside for various minorities including Europeans, Chinese, and [[Banaba Island|Banaban Islanders]].

The [[Fijian Political Party]] led by [[Sitiveni Rabuka]], who had instigated the 1987 coups, won 32 of the 37 seats reserved for ethnic Fijians and Rotuman; the remaining five were won by the extremist [[Fijian Nationalist Party]] of [[Sakeasi Butadroka]].  The 27 Indo-Fijian electorates were almost equally divided, with the [[National Federation Party (Fiji)|National Federation Party]] winning 14 seats and the [[Fiji Labour Party]] 13.  All five of the &amp;quot;general electorates&amp;quot; were won by the [[General Voters Party (Fiji)|General Voters Party]].
