&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fierljeppen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (lit. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;far-leaping&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a traditional [[sport]] of the [[Frisians]] and of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ljeppen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] for &amp;quot;to leap&amp;quot;. It is a fine example of the close relationship between the [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] and [[English language]]s.

==Description==
The sport involves a long pole and a body of water.  The pole is between 8 and 13 m long and has a flat round plate at the bottom to prevent it from sinking into the muddy river or canal bottom.

A jump consists of a sprint to the pole (polsstok), jumping and grabbing it, then climbing to the top of the pole while trying to control its forward and lateral movements over a body of water, and finishing by landing on a sand bed opposite to the starting point.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.pbholland.com/info.php?context=alle&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
The sport is believed to have originated with farmers who used poles to leap over small water drainage channels to access different plots of land. In [[East Frisia]] this sport is known as Pultstock-Jumping.  Today the sport is primarily practiced for fun or to entertain tourists, but there still is an official annual &amp;apos;&amp;apos;National Fierljepping Manifestation&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (NFM) in the Netherlands, and championships are contested in six leagues and numerous clubs.

==Record holders==
The current overall record holder is [[Bart Helmholt]] from [[Hardegarijp]] (Friesland). He leaped a distance of 21.51 meters in 2011 during the Dutch Championships.

The current Dutch record holders by category are:&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;pbholland&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.pbholland.com/stats.php?&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;context=Alle Dutch official records in fierljeppen] from pbholland.com&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
*Seniors: 21.51 meters, Bart Helmholt from [[Burgum]], Friesland (27 August 2011, Linschoten)
*Juniors: 20.41 meters, Jaco de Groot from [[Woerden]], Utrecht (9 August 2006, Linschoten)
*Boys: 19.24 meters, Age Hulder from [[Burgum]], Friesland (1 August 2009, Linschoten)
*Ladies: 16.74 meters, Dymphie van Rooijen from [[IJsselstein]], Utrecht (21 August 2011, Linschoten)

==Fierljeppen throughout the world==
International tourists who have visited Friesland and who have observed this sport have helped to spread its popularity throughout the globe.  Competitions in other locales now take place, albeit at a less competitive level due to smaller numbers of athletes and the lack of suitable locations.

Many Americans were first introduced to the sport, here referred to as &amp;quot;ditch-vaulting&amp;quot;, on Season 12 of [[The Amazing Race]]. This same task would be performed 9 seasons later as a &amp;quot;switchback&amp;quot; task.

The Japanese reality TV Series called [[Sasuke (TV series)|Sasuke]] (also called Ninja Warrior) has also featured this obstacle.
