&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;General elections&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were held in [[Fiji]] between 4 and 11 April 1987.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Nohlen, D, Grotz, F &amp;amp; Hartmann, C (2001) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume II&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p653 ISBN 0-19-924959-8&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was historic in that it marked the first electoral transition of power in Fijian history.  The [[Fijian Alliance|Alliance Party]] of the longtime [[List of Prime Ministers of Fiji|Prime Minister]], [[Kamisese Mara|Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara]], was defeated by a multiracial coalition, consisting of the [[Fiji Labour Party]] (contesting the election for the first time), the [[Indo-Fijian]]-dominated [[National Federation Party (Fiji)|National Federation Party]], and two smaller parties, the [[Western United Front (Fiji)|Western United Front]] and the [[Fiji Nationalist Party]].  In the [[House of Representatives (Fiji)|House of Representatives]], the coalition won a total of 28 seats to the Alliance&amp;apos;s 24, and [[Timoci Bavadra|Dr Timoci Bavadra]], the leader of the coalition, became Prime Minister.

Bavadra&amp;apos;s 28 member Parliamentary caucus included only 7 [[Fijian people|ethnic Fijians]], all of them elected with predominantly Indo-Fijian support from &amp;quot;[[National constituencies (Fiji)|national]]&amp;quot; as opposed to &amp;quot;[[Communal constituencies (Fiji)|communal]]&amp;quot; electorates.  (Fiji then had a complex voting system, allocating ethnic Fijians and Indo-Fijians 22 seats each, with a further 8 reserved for Europeans, Chinese, and other minorities.  12 of the representatives for both indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians group represented &amp;quot;communal&amp;quot; constituencies, elected from closed [[electoral roll]]s, while the other 10 represented &amp;quot;national&amp;quot; constituencies, elected by universal suffrage; the 8 minority seats comprised 3 communal and 5 national constituencies).  Only six ethnic Fijians, including Dr Bavadra, were appointed to the new cabinet, as opposed to seven Into-Fijians and minority representative.  Effective Indo-Fijian domination of the government caused widespread resentment among the ethnic Fijian community, and after less than a month in office, the new government was deposed in on May 14, 1987 in a [[Fiji coups of 1987|coup d&amp;apos;Ã©tat]] led by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Sitiveni Rabuka]].
