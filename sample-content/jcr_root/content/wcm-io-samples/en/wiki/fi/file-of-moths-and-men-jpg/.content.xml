# This image is a low-resolution image of a book cover.
# This image does not limit the copyright holder&amp;apos;s ability to profit from the original source, nor will it dilute the importance or recognition of the book or the author in connection with its organization.
# This image enhances the article in which it&amp;apos;s displayed, as it provides an immediate relevance to the reader more capably than the textual description alone.
#Use of the book cover visually identifies the book and the author and the publisher in a manner that mere prose cannot, and meets all criteria in [[WP:NFCC]].
|Replaceability=Not replaceable; book covers are always presumed non-free.
