&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;General elections&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were held in [[Fiji]] between 10 and 17 July 1982.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Nohlen, D, Grotz, F &amp;amp; Hartmann, C (2001) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume II&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p653 ISBN 0-19-924959-8&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The paradoxical results were both a triumph and a setback for the [[Fijian Alliance|Fijian Alliance Party]] of the [[List of Prime Ministers of Fiji|Prime Minister]], [[Kamisese Mara|Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara]].  The Alliance captured an unprecedented 51.8 percent of the popular vote - the first time that it had received an [[absolute majority]].  However, it won only 28 seats, 8 fewer than at [[Fiji election of 1977 (September)|the previous election]] of September 1977.  Part of the reason for this discrepancy was the surge in support for Ratu Mara&amp;apos;s Alliance in the [[Indo-Fijian]] community, from 14 percent to almost 24 percent, was not sufficient to translate into seats in Fiji&amp;apos;s communal electoral system, and did not therefore off-set losses among the [[Fijian people|ethnic Fijian]] community, particularly in the west of the country.  The [[Western United Front (Fiji)|Western United Front]] of [[Osea Gavidi|Ratu Osea Gavidi]] won only two seats, but split the vote, allowing the [[National Federation Party (Fiji)|National Federation party]], with which it tactically allied itself, to pick up six seats for a total of 22.
