        text="&lt;p&gt;==Summary==
Cover of [[The Doors]] album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Doors (album)|The Doors]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Fair use rationale for [[The Doors (album)]]==
{{Non-free use rationale|Article = The Doors (album)
|Description=Cover for the album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Doors (album)|The Doors]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[The Doors]].
|Source=Derived from a scan of the album cover (creator of this digital version is irrelevant as the copyright in all equivalent images is still held by the same party). Copyright held by the record company or the artist. Claimed as fair use regardless.
|Portion=Entire front cover, but does not include back or insides of original artwork
|Resolution=Is only as much resolution as necessary to identify and show the style of artwork used for the article, not enough to be used for piracy.
|Purpose=Illustrates the articles [[The Doors (album)]] which both provide enough critical commentary for fair use to be applicible.
|Replaceability=No free equivalent can equal this image (any would be a derivative of this artwork)
|other_information= Image in this form is already widely distributed to identify the album as part of catalogs and reviews, so we degrade no market value by providing it ourselves.}}

==Licensing==
{{Non-free album cover|image has rationale=yes}}
