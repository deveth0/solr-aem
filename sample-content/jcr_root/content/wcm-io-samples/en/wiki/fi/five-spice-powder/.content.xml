&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Five-spice powder&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[spice mix|mixture of five spices]] used primarily in [[Chinese cuisine]] but also used in other Asian and Arabic cookery.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;hf&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodreference.com/html/a109-chinese-5spice.html |title=High Five: Chinese Five Spice Powder |publisher=Foodreference.com |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Formula==
While there are many variants, a common mix is:&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ency&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.theepicentre.com/Spices/chinesefivespice.html Chinese Five Spice] at The Epicentre&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
*[[Star anise]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;bajiao&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 八角)
*[[Clove]]s (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;dingxiang&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 丁香)
*Chinese [[Cinnamomum cassia|Cinnamon]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;rougui&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 肉桂)
*[[Sichuan pepper]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;huajiao&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 花椒)
*[[Fennel]] seeds (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;xiaohuixiang&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 小茴香)
Other recipes may contain [[anise]] seed or [[ginger root]], [[nutmeg]], [[turmeric]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Amomum villosum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; pods (砂仁),  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Amomum cardamomum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; pods (白豆蔻), [[licorice]], [[black pepper]], [[Mandarin orange]] peel，or [[galangal]]. In the South China, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Cinnamomum loureiroi]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and Mandarin orange peel is commonly used as a substitute for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cinnamomum cassia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and cloves, respectively, producing a different flavour for southern versions five-spice powders.

==Usage==
Five spice may be used with fatty meats      such as pork and duck. It is used as a [[spice rub]] for chicken, duck, pork and seafood, in [[red cooking]] recipes, or added to the breading for fried foods.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ency&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Five spice is used in recipes for [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]] roasted duck, as well as beef stew. It is used as a marinade for Vietnamese broiled chicken. The five-spice powder mixture has followed the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese diaspora]] and has been incorporated into other national cuisines throughout Asia.

Although this mixture is used in restaurant cooking, many Chinese households do not use it in day-to-day cooking.  In [[Cuisine of Hawaii|Hawaii]], some restaurants place a shaker of the spice on each patron&amp;apos;s table. A [[seasoned salt]] can be easily made by dry-roasting common [[salt]] with five-spice powder under low heat in a dry pan until the spice and salt are well mixed.
