The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (FIPA) is a body for developing and setting  [[computer software]] standards for heterogeneous and interacting [[Software agent|agents]] and agent-based systems.

FIPA was founded as a Swiss [[not-for-profit]] organization in 1996 with the ambitious goal of defining a full set of standards for both implementing systems within which agents could execute (agent platforms) and specifying how agents themselves should communicate and interact.

Within its lifetime the organization&amp;apos;s membership included several academic institutions and a large number of companies including [[Hewlett Packard]], [[IBM]], [[British Telecom|BT]] (formerly British Telecom), [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Fujitsu]] and many more.  A number of standards were proposed, however, despite several agent platforms adopting the &amp;quot;FIPA standard&amp;quot; for agent communication it never succeeded in gaining the commercial support which was originally envisaged. The Swiss organization was dissolved in 2005 and an [[IEEE]] standards committee was set up in its place.

The most widely adopted of the FIPA standards are the Agent Management and [[Agent Communication Language]] (FIPA-ACL) specifications.

The name FIPA is somewhat of a [[misnomer]] as the &amp;quot;physical [[Software agent|agents]]&amp;quot; with which the body is concerned exist solely in software (and hence have no physical aspect).
