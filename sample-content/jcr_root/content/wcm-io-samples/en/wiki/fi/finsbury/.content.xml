&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Finsbury&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a district of [[central London]], England.  It lies immediately north of the [[City of London]] and [[Clerkenwell]], west of [[Shoreditch]], and south of [[Islington]] and [[City Road]].  It is in the south of the [[London Borough of Islington]].  The [[Finsbury Estate]] is in the western part of the district.  The eastern part of the district is now sometimes known as [[St Luke&amp;apos;s]].

==Etymology==
The name is first recorded as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vinisbir&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1231) and means &amp;quot;manor of a man called Finn.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=mills&amp;gt;Mills, D., &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oxford Dictionary of London Place Names&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2000) ISBN 0-19-860957-4&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
In the Middle Ages Finsbury was part of the great fen which lay outside the walls of the City of London.&amp;lt;ref name=encyc&amp;gt;Weinreb, B. and Hibbert, C. (ed)(1983) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The London Encyclopaedia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Macmillan ISBN 0-333-57688-8&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  It gave its name to the [[Finsbury division]] of the [[Ossulstone]] hundred of Middlesex.  In the early 17th century trees were planted and gravel walks made, and the area became a place for recreation.  In 1641 the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] moved to Finsbury, where it still remains, and in 1665 the [[Bunhill Fields]] burial ground was opened in the area.  The [[City of London Yeomanry]] (COLY) also had its headquarters in nearby Finsbury Square when founded at the time of the [[Second Boer War]].

Building on Finsbury Fields began in the late 17th century.  The [[St Luke Old Street (church)|parish church of St Luke&amp;apos;s]] was built in 1732-33, and at the end of the 18th century a residential suburb was built with its centre at [[Finsbury Square]].&amp;lt;ref name=encyc/&amp;gt;

In 1832 the [[Finsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|parliamentary borough of Finsbury]] was created, covering a considerably wider area, part of the Finsbury division of Ossultone hundred.  In 1857 a park was opened some 3 miles north of Finsbury for the enjoyment of the residents of the parliamentary borough, and named [[Finsbury Park]].&amp;lt;ref name=mills/&amp;gt;

The [[Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury]] in the County of London was created in 1900, covering the area of Finsbury and Clerkenwell. In 1938, Dr. [[Chuni Lal Katial]] was elected mayor of Finsbury, making him the first Asian mayor in the United Kingdom.  In 1942 the borough council erected a controversial statue of [[Vladimir Lenin]] in Holford Square (now demolished).  The borough was abolished in 1965 and absorbed into the borough of Islington.
