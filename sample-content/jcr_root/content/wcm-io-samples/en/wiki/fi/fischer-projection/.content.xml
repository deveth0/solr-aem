The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fischer projection&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, devised by [[Hermann Emil Fischer]] in 1891,&amp;lt;ref name=mcmurry&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=Organic Chemistry|author=John McMurry|year=2008|edition=7th|publisher=Brooks/Cole - Thomson Learning, Inc.|pages=975|isbn=0-13-286261-1}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- and Nawang Sheling, (need a citation for this) --&amp;gt; is a [[two-dimensional]] representation of a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[organic molecule]] by [[Graphical projection|projection]]. Fischer projections were originally proposed for the depiction of carbohydrates and used by [[chemist]]s, particularly in [[organic chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]]. The use of Fischer projections in non-carbohydrates is discouraged, as such drawings are ambiguous when confused with other types of drawing.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;IUPAC Recommendations 2006&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

== Conventions ==
[[File:D-glucose-chain-2D-Fischer.png|thumb|left|100px|[[D-glucose]] chain]]

All [[chemical bond|bond]]s are depicted as horizontal or vertical lines. The [[carbon chain]] is depicted vertically, with [[carbon]] atoms represented by the center of crossing lines. The orientation of the carbon chain is so that the C1 carbon is at the top. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Understanding Fischer Projection and Angular Line Representation Conversion&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Luis F. Moreno Journal of Chemical Education 2012 89 (1), 175-176 {{DOI|10.1021/ed101011c}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In an [[aldose]], the carbon of the [[aldehyde]] group is C1; in a [[ketose]] the carbon of the [[ketone]] group has the lowest possible number (usually C2).

A Fischer projection is used to differentiate between L- and D- molecules. On a Fischer projection, the penultimate carbon of D sugars are depicted with [[hydrogen]] on the left and [[hydroxyl]] on the right. L sugars will be shown with the hydrogen on the right and the hydroxyl on the left.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Sugars &amp;amp; Polysaccharides| publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)| accessdate=2011-07-10| url=http://rpi.edu/dept/bcbp/molbiochem/MBWeb/mb1/part2/sugar.htm}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In a Fischer projection, all horizontal bonds project toward the viewer, while vertical bonds project away from the viewer. Therefore, a Fischer projection cannot be rotated by 90° or 270° in the plane of the page or the screen, as the orientation of bonds relative to one another can change, converting a molecule to its [[enantiomer]].
According to IUPAC rules, all hydrogen atoms should preferably be drawn explicitly; in particular, the hydrogen atoms of the end group of carbohydrates should be present.

== Usage ==

Fischer projections are most commonly used in biochemistry and organic chemistry to represent [[monosaccharide]]s, but can also be used for [[amino acids]] or for other organic molecules. Since Fischer projections depict the [[stereochemistry]] (three-dimensional structure) of a [[molecule]], they are very useful for differentiating between enantiomers of [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] molecules.

== Other systems ==

[[Haworth projection]]s are a related chemical notation used to represent sugars in ring form. The groups on the right hand side of a Fischer projection are equivalent to those below the plane of the ring in Haworth projections.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Matthews, C. E.; K. E. Van Holde; K. G. Ahern (1999) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Biochemistry&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. 3rd edition. Benjamin Cummings. ISBN 0-8053-3066-6&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Fischer projections should not be confused with [[Lewis structure]]s, which do not contain any information about three dimensional [[molecular geometry|geometry]].
