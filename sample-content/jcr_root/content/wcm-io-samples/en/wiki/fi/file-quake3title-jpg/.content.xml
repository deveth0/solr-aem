==Fair use rationale for [[Quake III Arena]]==
It is believed that the use of this image qualifies as fair use in the article &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quake III Arena&amp;apos;&amp;apos; because:

* [[id Software]] has released no such images into the public domain, and a replacement image could not be created that would adequately provide the same information
* The image is being used for no purpose other than to identify the subject of the article
* The image resolution has been significantly decreased from the original, so copies made from it would be of inferior quality
* The use of this image neither detracts from the game nor inhibits its salability in any way&lt;/p&gt;" />
