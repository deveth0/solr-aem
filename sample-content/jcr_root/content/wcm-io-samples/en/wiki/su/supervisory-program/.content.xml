A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;supervisory program&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;supervisor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[computer program]], usually part of an [[operating system]], that controls the execution of other [[Subroutine|routines]] and regulates [[Scheduling (computing)|work scheduling]], [[input/output]] operations, [[Exception handling|error actions]], and similar functions and regulates the flow of work in a [[data processing]] system.

It can also refer to a program that allocates computer component space and schedules computer events by [[Priority queue|task queuing]] and system [[interrupt]]s. Control of the system is returned to the supervisory program frequently enough to ensure that demands on the system are met.

Historically, this term was essentially associated with [[IBM]]&amp;apos;s line of [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] operating systems starting with [[OS/360]]. In other operating systems, the supervisor is generally called the [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]].

In the 1970s, IBM further abstracted the supervisor [[State (computer science)|state]] from the hardware, resulting in a [[hypervisor]] that enabled [[full virtualization]], i.e. the capacity to run multiple operating systems on the same machine totally independently from each other. Hence the first such system was called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Virtual Machine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[VM (operating system)|VM]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
