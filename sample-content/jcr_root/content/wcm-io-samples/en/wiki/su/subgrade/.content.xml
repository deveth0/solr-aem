It is also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;formation level&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The term can also refer to imported material that has been used to build an [[Embankment (transportation)|embankment]].

==Construction==

Subgrades are commonly compacted before the construction of a road, pavement or railway track, and are sometimes stabilized by the addition of [[asphalt]], [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[portland cement]] or other modifiers.  The subgrade is the foundation of the pavement structure, on which the [[subbase (pavement)|subbase]] is laid.

Preparation of the subgrade for construction usually involves digging, in order to remove surface vegetation, [[topsoil]] and other unwanted material, and to create space for the upper layer of the pavement. This process is known as &amp;quot;subgrade formation&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;reduction to level&amp;quot;.

The load-bearing strength of subgrade is measured by [[California Bearing Ratio]] (CBR) test, [[falling weight deflectometer]] [[backcalculation]]s and other methods.
