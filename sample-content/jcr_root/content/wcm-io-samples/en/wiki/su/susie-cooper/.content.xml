        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Susan Vera Cooper&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Susie Cooper&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (29 October 1902 â€“ 28 July 1995) was a prolific [[England|English]] [[ceramic]] designer working in the [[Stoke-on-Trent]] [[pottery]] industries from the 1920s to the 1980s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/content/articles/2006/04/13/local_heroes_susie_cooper_01_feature.shtml|title=Local Heroes: Susie Cooper|work=BBC|date=13 April 2006|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Life and work==
Born in Stanfields, Stoke-on-Trent, she was the youngest of seven children. From an early age she developed an interest in drawing, and began her art education by attending night classes at the [[Burslem School of Art]]. In 1922 she joined the ceramics firm [[Gray&amp;apos;s Pottery|A.E. Gray &amp;amp; Co. Ltd]],&amp;lt;ref name=obituary&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-susie-cooper-1594209.html|title=Obituaries: Susie Cooper|work=The Independent|date=1 August 1995|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; partially as a means to gain entry to the [[Royal College of Art]].

A. Edward Gray quickly discovered her talents as a painter and designer, and soon enough Susie was producing her hand-painted floral designs. In 1923 A.E. Gray launched the Gloria Lustre Range employing the technique of [[lustreware]]. In 1929, motivated by her desire to design ceramic shapes in addition to decors, she broke away with her brother-in-law Albert &amp;quot;Jack&amp;quot; Beeson to set up her own business, as Susie Cooper Potteries.

Susie worked for many other pottery firms over the next several decades, including [[Wedgwood]]. In 1940 she was awarded the [[Royal Designer for Industry]] by the [[Royal Society of Arts]],&amp;lt;ref name=obituary/&amp;gt; and in 1979 she received an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]. By all accounts [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Elizabeth, The Queen Mother]] was an admirer of her work.

At the age of 80 she retired to live on the [[Isle of Man]], where she died in 1995. Like other [[Potteries]] based ceramic designers such as [[Clarice Cliff]] and [[Charlotte Rhead]], her work has become highly sought after and valued by pottery collectors.
