The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sun of May&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-es|Sol de Mayo}}) is one of the national emblems of [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], and it is shown on both countries&amp;apos; flags.

==Features and specifics==
The Sun of May is a representation of the [[Andean civilizations|Inca]] sun god [[Inti]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=[[Historia Argentina]] |trans_title=Argentine history |last=Abad de Santillán |first=Diego |authorlink=Diego Abad de Santillán |year=1965 |publisher=TEA (Tipográfica Editora Argentina) |location=Buenos Aires |language=Spanish |isbn=2900104629702 {{Please check ISBN|reason=13 digit ISBN should start with  978 or 979.}} }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The [[sun]], called the Sun of May, is a replica of an engraving on [[Argentine real|the first Argentine coin]], approved in 1813 by the [[Asamblea del Año XIII|Constituent Assembly]], whose value was eight &amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{lang|es|[[Spanish escudo|escudos]]}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (one Spanish dollar).

In form, it is similar to — and may be partially derived from — the [[sun in splendour]] common in European heraldry. This too is usually depicted with a face, and with alternating straight and wavy rays (representing light and heat respectively),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry |last=Fox-Davies |first=Arthur Charles |authorlink=Arthur Charles Fox-Davies |year=1969 |publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons |location=Aylesbury |isbn=978-0-17-144102-4 |page=222}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; though it normally has only sixteen rays.

In 1978 the sun colour was specified to be golden yellow (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{lang|es|amarillo oro}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), to have an inner diameter of 10&amp;amp;nbsp;cm, and an outer diameter of 25&amp;amp;nbsp;cm (the diameter of the sun equals {{frac|5|6}} the height of the white stripe, and the sun&amp;apos;s face is {{frac|2|5}} of its height). It features 32 rays, 16 undulated and 16 straight in alternation,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.institutoceremonial.edu.ar/patria-bandera.php |title=Nuestra patria: bandera nacional |publisher=Argentine Institute of Protocol and Public Relations|language=Spanish |trans_title=Our fatherland: national flag |accessdate=November 1, 2011 |quote=Es un sol figurado con rostro humano, de color oro amarillo con treinta y dos rayos: 16 flamígeros apuntando o &amp;quot;girando&amp;quot; en sentido horario, y 16 rectos colocados alternativamente, según diseño de la primera moneda argentina.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and since 1978 it must be embroidered in the official ceremonial flag.

==Name and origin==
The specification &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;of May&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; is a reference to the [[May Revolution]] which took place in the week from 18 to 25 May 1810, which marked the beginning of the independence from the [[Spanish Empire]] for the countries that were part of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] by then. There is a legend that as the [[Primera Junta|new government]] was proclaimed, the sun broke through the clouds, which was seen as a good omen.

The sun, like the [[Phrygian cap]] on Argentina&amp;apos;s coat of arms and the triband flag, was already used as an emblem of the [[French Revolution]]. It has been speculated that groups of deputies in the French revolution used a seal very similar to the current Argentine coat of arms, including a sun symbol. In France, the sun was used especially in relation to the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]]. The sun in the French Revolution was adopted as a symbol from [[Freemasonry|Freemasonic]] representations of the [[Eye of Providence|all-seeing eye]], in a triangle in a burst of sunrays. This representation was itself copied directly from a [[Christian]] symbol, the triangle representing the [[Trinity]] (this symbol is still seen in some European churches and cathedrals, but its use was never widespread). The eye was possibly already a middle eastern representation of God before the time of Jesus, but placing an eye in a triangle and sun-burst seems to have been a purely Christian variant.

In traditional European [[heraldry]], the same symbol is called  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the [[Sun (heraldry)|Sun in His Splendour]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the Sun in His Glory&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
