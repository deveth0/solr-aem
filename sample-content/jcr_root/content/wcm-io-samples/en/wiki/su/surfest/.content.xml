        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Surfest&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an annual [[surfing]] [[competition]] held in [[Newcastle, New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Surfest began in 1985 as an initiative of Newcastle City Council, and at the time, was the world&amp;apos;s richest surfing competition. The event runs for thirteen days, and from the 2007 event, will be held at [[Newcastle Stretch|Merewether Beach]], having been held between [[Newcastle Stretch|Newcastle Beach]] and [[Newcastle Stretch|South Newcastle Beach]] in the past.

It is Newcastle&amp;apos;s only annual international sporting event and attracts more than 200 surfers, with many coming from around the globe. Former winners include local Novocastrian [[Mark Richards (surfer)|Mark Richards]].  It is rumoured that 2008&amp;apos;s Surfest will be moved to Merewether for financial reasons.
