The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Suquamish&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are a [[Lushootseed language|Lushootseed]]-speaking [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe, located in present-day [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] in the [[United States]].

The Suquamish are a southern [[Coast Salish people]]; they spoke a dialect of [[Lushootseed]], which belongs to the [[Salishan]] language family. Like many Northwest Coast natives, the Suquamish relied on fishing from local rivers and [[Puget Sound]] for food.  They built plank longhouses to protect themselves from the wet winters west of the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]].

The Suquamish traditionally lived on the western shores of Puget Sound, from [[Apple Tree Cove]] in the north to [[Gig Harbor]] in the south, including [[Bainbridge Island, Washington|Bainbridge Island]] and [[Blake Island]].  During the summer, the Suquamish were widely dispersed, but during the winter, they lived in a winter village centered around [[Old Man House]], the largest longhouse on Puget Sound.

The first contact between the Suquamish and European explorers came in 1792 when [[George Vancouver]] explored Puget Sound and met with members of the Suquamish tribe, possibly including [[Schweabe]] and [[Chief Kitsap|Kitsap]].  More regular contact with non-Indians came with the establishment of British trading posts in Puget Sound and the [[Strait of Georgia]] in the early 19th century.

Once the [[Washington Territory]] was established in 1853, the U.S. government began signing treaties with area tribes to acquire their lands.  The Suquamish people ceded most of their land to the United States when they signed the [[Point Elliott Treaty]] on January 22, 1855. They were able to retain some land, the [[Port Madison Indian Reservation]], near their winter village site on [[Agate Pass]].

Though the Puget Sound Salish peoples were not generally organized above the level of individual villages, the Suquamish had a central location on Puget Sound.  Two members of the Suquamish came to be recognized across the region as great leaders.  One was [[Chief Kitsap|Kitsap]], who led a coalition of Puget Sound tribes against the [[Cowichan Tribes]] of [[Vancouver Island]] around 1825.  Another was [[Chief Seattle|Seattle]] (also spelled Sealth, See-ahth, and Seathl, pronounced {{IPA-sal|ˈsiʔaːɬ|}}), son of Schweabe, who was a great orator and peace-keeper during the turbulent times of the mid-19th century.  Though both Kitsap and Sealth are often called &amp;quot;Chief&amp;quot;, this is an attribution by English speakers; such designations were not used by the Puget Sound Indians themselves{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; the use of the term on the tribe&amp;apos;s own website seems to weaken it, although it may of course be that custom and practice in the tribe has changed.|date=February 2013}}. However, the tribe&amp;apos;s website refers to both &amp;quot;Chief Seattle&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Chief Kitsap&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.suquamish.nsn.us/HistoryCulture.aspx] Website of the Suquamish Tribe, History and Culture section.

[[Martha George]] served as chairperson from the late 1920s to the early 1940s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web

In 2011, the Suquamish tribal council voted unanimously to approve same-sex marriage.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|last=Yardley|first=William|title=A Washington State Indian Tribe Approves Same-Sex Marriage|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/us/12tribe.html?_r=1&amp;amp;hp#|accessdate=August 12, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 12, 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
