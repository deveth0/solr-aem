&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Suleiman II&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 15, 1642 – June 22/23 1691) ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: سليمان ثانى &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Süleymān-i &amp;lt;u&amp;gt;s&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;ānī&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1687 to 1691.

==Early life==
The younger brother of [[Mehmed IV]] (1648&amp;amp;ndash;87), Suleiman II was born at [[Topkapı Palace]] in [[Constantinople]] and had spent most of his life in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[kafes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (cage), a kind of luxurious prison for princes of the blood within the [[Topkapı Palace]] (it was designed to ensure that none could organize a rebellion). His mother was a Serbian girl named Katarina&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ali Kemal Meram, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Padişah Anaları:

==Reign==
===Ottoman–Habsburg War===
[[File:Battle of Mohács 1687.jpg|thumb|The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Army]] after suffering a devastating defeat during the [[Battle of Mohács (1687)|Second Battle of Mohács]].]]

Immediately after assuming the throne, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] suffered a devastating defeat at [[Battle of Mohács (1687)|the second Battle of Mohács]]. Unable to rule effectively himself, Suleiman II shrewdly appointed [[Köprülü Fazıl Mustafa Pasha]] as his [[Grand Vizier]]. Even so, when [[Russia]] joined an alliance of European powers, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] suffered the devastating [[Crimean campaigns]].

Under Köprülü&amp;apos;s leadership the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] halted an [[Austria]]n advance into [[Serbia]] and crushed an uprising in [[Bulgaria]] until [[Köprülü Fazıl Mustafa Pasha]] was killed in the [[Battle of Slankamen]] by Austrian forces. Suleiman II died at [[Edirne]] Palace in 1691. He married Khadija, but died without issue.

===Relations with the Mughal Empire===

In the year 1688 the desperate [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan Suleiman II urgently requested for assistance against the rapidly advancing [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrians]], during the [[Great Turkish War|Ottoman–Habsburg War]] however the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]] and his forces were heavily engaged in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Deccan Wars&amp;apos;&amp;apos; against the [[Marathas]] to commit any formal assistance to their desperate Ottoman allies.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uB1uAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;q=suleiman+ii#search_anchor |title=Mughal-Ottoman relations: a study of political &amp;amp; diplomatic relations ... - Naimur Rahman Farooqi - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=29 April 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
