In a [[hierarchy]] or [[tree structure]] of any kind, a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;superior&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an individual or position at a higher level in the hierarchy than another (a &amp;quot;subordinate&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;inferior&amp;quot;), and thus closer to the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]]. It is often used in business terminology to refer to people who are [[supervisor]]s  and in the military to people who are higher in the [[chain of command]] (Superior Officer). Superiors are given, sometimes supreme, authority over others in the control. When an order is given, one must follow that order and obey it or punishment may be issued.

A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Religious Superior&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the person to whom a [[cleric]] is immediately responsible under [[canon law]]. For [[monk]]s, it would be the [[Abbot]] (or the [[Abbess]] for [[nun]]s); for [[friar]]s, it would be the [[Prior]], or, for [[Franciscans]], the Guardian (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Custos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;); for [[Diocese|diocesan]] priests, it would be the local [[Bishop]]. In religious orders with a hierarchy above the local community, there will also be [[Superior general|superiors general]] and possibly [[provincial superior]]s above the local abbot, prior, or [[Abbess|Mother Superior]].
