&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Saint Charles Garnier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]], baptised in [[Paris]] on May 25, 1606, was a [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]], who was [[martyr]]ed at [[Sainte-Marie among the Hurons]] on December 7, 1649.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Charlotte Gray &amp;apos;The Museum Called Canada: 25 Rooms of Wonder&amp;apos; Random House, 2004&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The son of a secretary to King [[Henri III of France]], Garnier joined the Jesuit seminary in [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]] in 1624 and was ordained in 1635. His father initially forbade him from travelling to Canada where he would face almost certain death as a missionary, but he was eventually allowed to go and arrived in the colony of [[New France]] in 1636. He travelled immediately to the Huron mission with fellow Jesuit, [[Pierre Chastellain]].

He spent the rest of his life as a missionary among the [[Wyandot people|Huron]]s, never returning to [[Quebec]]. The Hurons nicknamed him &amp;quot;Ouracha&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;rain-giver&amp;quot;, after his arrival was followed by a drought-ending rainfall. He was greatly influenced by fellow missionary [[Jean de Brébeuf]], and was known as the &amp;quot;lamb&amp;quot; to Brebeuf&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;lion&amp;quot;. When Brébeuf was killed in March 1649, Garnier knew he too might soon die. On December 7, 1649 he was indeed killed by the [[Iroquois]] during an attack on the Huron village where he was living.

Charles Garnier was canonized in 1930 by [[Pope Pius XI]] with the other [[Canadian Martyrs]], and his [[feast day]] is October 19.
