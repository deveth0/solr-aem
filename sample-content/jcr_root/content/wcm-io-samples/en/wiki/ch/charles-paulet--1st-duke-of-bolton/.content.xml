&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Charles Paulet, 1st Duke of Bolton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Privy Council of England|PC]] (c. 1625 &amp;amp;ndash; 27 February 1699), son of [[John Paulet, 5th Marquess of Winchester]].  He became the sixth [[Marquess of Winchester]] on his father&amp;apos;s death in 1675, was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Winchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Winchester]] and then for [[Hampshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Hampshire]] from 1660 to 1675. Before his accession to the Marquessate he was styled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lord St John&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[George Edward Cokayne]], ed. [[Vicary Gibbs (MP)|Vicary Gibbs]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Complete Peerage]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, vol. II, p. 211, The St Catherine Press, London, 1912&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Having supported the claim of [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] to the English throne in 1688, he was restored to the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] and to the office of [[Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire]], and was created [[Duke of Bolton]] in April 1689. He built [[Bolton Hall, North Yorkshire]] in 1678.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-321801-bolton-hall-preston-under-scar-north-yor|title= Bolton Hall, Preston-under-Scar|publisher= British Listed Buildings|accessdate = 2013-02-03}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

An eccentric man, hostile to [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] and afterwards to the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]], he is said to have travelled during 1687 with four coaches and 100 horsemen, sleeping during the day and giving entertainments at night.

By his wife Mary, the natural daughter of [[Emanuel Scrope, 1st Earl of Sunderland]], he had six children:
*[[Charles Paulet, 2nd Duke of Bolton]] (1661–1722)
*[[Lord William Powlett]] (c.1667–1729)
*Lady Jane Paulet (d. c.1715), married on 2 April 1673 [[John Egerton, 3rd Earl of Bridgwater]]
*Lady Elizabeth Paulet, married Toby Jenkins
*Lord Thomas Paulet (d. June 1690, young)
*Lady Mary Paulet
