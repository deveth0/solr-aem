        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Charles H. V. Christie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 13, 1880 &amp;amp;ndash; October 1, 1955) was a [[film|motion picture]] studio owner.

Born in [[London, Ontario]], [[Canada]], Charles and his brother [[Al Christie|Al]] left home to pursue a career in the fledgling motion picture industry. In [[Hollywood, California]], they made enough money working in films to purchase a property in Los Angeles and set up their own [[Christie Film Company]] to make comedy movies.

Charles was primarily the business administrator, while brother Al made films. Before long, the Christie brothers were two of Hollywood&amp;apos;s most powerful movie moguls. However, the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]] and the ensuing [[Great Depression]] devastated business and in January 1933, the Christie brothers companies went into [[receivership]], the studio assets being acquired by another large film making company.

While his brother remained with the new owners, producing comedy films, Charles went into the selling of real estate.

Charles Christie died in Hollywood. He is interred in the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]], [[Hollywood, California]]. He has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1719 Vine Street.
