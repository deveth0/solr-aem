&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chicheley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[Milton Keynes (borough)|Borough of Milton Keynes]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.milton-keynes.gov.uk/parishes/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=17026 Parishes in Milton Keynes] - Milton Keynes Council.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The village is about 2Â½&amp;amp;nbsp;miles north east of [[Newport Pagnell]].

The village name is [[Old English language|Anglo Saxon]] in origin, and means &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cicca&amp;apos;s clearing&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, the village was recorded as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cicelai&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The [[Manorialism|manor]] of Chicheley (which some suggest may have once been called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thickthorn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) anciently belonged to the Pagnell family of [[Newport Pagnell]], but was given by them to the [[Christian Church|church]]. Through this connection the village also at one time belonged to [[Cardinal Wolsey]], though only until his forced resignation by King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] who took all his possessions from him at that time.

During the [[English Civil War]], the manor, belonging to the Chester family, received some considerable damage, associated as it was with the [[garrison]] at Newport Pagnell.  Following the civil war, the manor was demolished, and the present [[Chicheley Hall]] built on the site.  All that remains of the old manor today is one [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] [[over-mantel]] with termini [[caryatid]]s, and some [[wood panelling|panelling]] in the &amp;apos;new&amp;apos; Chicheley Hall.

The [[parish]] [[church (building)|church]] is dedicated to [[St Lawrence]] and has a [[perpendicular]] style central [[tower]] with large windows. The [[chancel]], which contains a fine plaster depicting floral wreaths in relief, and a stone [[reredos]], was rebuilt circa 1708; however, the church dates from the 14th century. In the [[nave]] are raised [[box pew]]s, giving a theatrical air.  The church contains [[monument]]s to Anthony Cave.  Cave&amp;apos;s [[sarcophagus]] is a [[cadaver tomb]].  Other monuments dating from 1635 are to the Chester family of Chicheley Hall.
