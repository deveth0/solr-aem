&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Christopher Anstey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (31 October, 1724 &amp;amp;ndash; 3 August, 1805) was an English writer and poet.

Anstey was the son of Dr. Anstey, a wealthy clergyman, the rector of [[Brinkley, Cambridgeshire|Brinkley (Cambridgeshire)]] where he was born.  He was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[King&amp;apos;s College, Cambridge]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Venn|ANSY742C}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; where he distinguished himself for his Latin verses. He became a fellow of his college (1745); but the degree of M.A. was withheld from him, owing to the offence caused by a speech made by him beginning: &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{lang|la|Doctores sine doctrina, magistri artium sine artibus, et baccalaurei baculo potius quam lauro digni}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; (Doctors without doctrine, artless Masters of Arts, and Bachelors more worthy of the rod than the laurel).

In 1754 he succeeded to the family estates, including [[Trumpington, Cambridgeshire|Anstey Hall, Trumpington]] and left Cambridge; and two years later he married Ann, the daughter of Felix Calvert of Albury Hall, Herts. For some time Anstey lived the life of a country squire, bringing up thirteen children, and published nothing of any note, though he cultivated letters as well as his estates. He served as [[High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire]] for 1770-71. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; {{cite web| url = http://www.brlsi.org/events-proceedings/proceedings/25151| title= Christopher Anstey:A life in 18th Century Bath|publisher = Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution|accessdate = 26 June 2013}} &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Some visits were made to Bath, however, where from 1770 until his death in 1805, he made No. 4 [[Royal Crescent]] his permanent home, (albeit the plaque recording this is actually displayed outside No. 5) &amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;lowndes&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Lowndes|first=William|title=The Royal Crescent in Bath|publisher=Redcliffe Press|year=1981|isbn=978-0-905459-34-9}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; where in 1766 he penned his famous rhymed letters, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The New Bath Guide&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Memoirs of the Blunderhead Family...&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a satirical poem of considerable sparkle, about the adventures of the &amp;quot;Blunderhead&amp;quot; family in [[Bath, England|Bath]], from which [[Tobias Smollett]] is said to have drawn largely in his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Expedition of Humphry Clinker]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The work had immediate success, and was enthusiastically praised for its original kind of humour by Walpole and Gray. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Election Ball, in Poetical Letters from Mr Inkle at Bath to his Wife at Gloucester&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1776) sustained the reputation won by the Guide. He made many other excursions into literature which are hardly remembered, and ended his days as a country squire at the age of eighty.  His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Poetical Works&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were collected in 1808 (2 vols.) by the author&amp;apos;s son [[John Anstey (poet)|John Anstey]] (d. 1819), himself author of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Pleader&amp;apos;s Guide&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1796), in the same vein with the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;New Bath Guide&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Anstey was buried at St. Swithin&amp;apos;s Church in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] but has a white marble memorial tablet in Poets&amp;apos; Corner (the South Transept) of [[Westminster Abbey]].
