{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chibi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|ちび or チビ|}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] slang word meaning &amp;quot;short person&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;small child.&amp;quot; The word has gained currency amongst fans of [[manga]] and [[anime]]. Its meaning is of someone or some animal that is small. It can be translated as &amp;quot;little,&amp;quot; but is not used the same way as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;chiisana&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [小さな] (tiny, small, little in Japanese) but rather cute. A prototypical example of the former usage in the original Japanese which brought the term to the attention of Western fans is [[Chibiusa]], a [[hypocoristic|pet name]] for the [[:wiktionary:diminutive|diminutive]] daughter of [[Sailor Moon (character)|Sailor Moon]] formed from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chibi Usagi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Little Rabbit&amp;quot;).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurozuki.com/takeuchi/sailormoon/volume03.html |title=Sailor Moon volume 3 translation |accessdate=2008-05-23}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In English-speaking [[anime and manga fandom]] ([[otaku]]), the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;chibi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has mostly been [[conflation|conflated]] with the &amp;quot;[[super deformed]]&amp;quot; style of drawing characters with oversized heads or it can be used to describe child versions of characters.

Chibi style is usually used in depicting scenes which are cute and/or humorous, and it is extremely rare for it to be used for an entire anime series. It is quite popular in manga, however.
