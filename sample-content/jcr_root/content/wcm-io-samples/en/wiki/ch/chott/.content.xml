In [[geology]], a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;chott&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;shebka&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the former spelling is French, pronounced /{{IPA|ʃɔt}}/ and sometimes spelled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;shott&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;šaṭṭ&amp;apos;&amp;apos; شط &amp;quot;bank, coast&amp;quot;, from the root &amp;apos;&amp;apos;šṭṭ&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;exceed, deviate&amp;quot;) is a dry ([[salt lake|salt]]) [[lake]] in the [[Sahara]]n area of [[Africa]] (mainly in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia) that stays dry in the summer, but receives some water in the winter. These lakes have changing shores and are dry for much of the year. They are formed by the waters of the spring thaw from the peaks of the [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas mountain range]], with occasional rainwater or [[groundwater]] discharge from sources in the Sahara, such as from the [[Bas Saharan Basin]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Encyclopedia of Inland Waters&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1= Ramdani|first1= Mohammed|last2= Elkhiat |first2= Najat|last3= Flower|first3= Roger J |authorlink= |editor= Likens, Gene E.|editor-link=|encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Inland Waters|title= Africa: North of Sahara|trans_title=|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=OzJOqh90RuwC |accessdate=16 December 2012|language=|edition=|date=|year= 2010|month=|publisher=Academic Press|volume=Lake Ecosystem Ecology|location=San Diego, CA |id=|isbn=0123820022|oclc=|doi=|pages=|quote=|ref=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Deserts and Desert Environments&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |last=Laity |first=Julie J. |authorlink= |title=Deserts and Desert Environments |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wtAbzLLTcwcC |accessdate=16 December 2012 |series=Environmental Systems and Global Change Series |year=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons |location=Chichester, UK |isbn=1444300741 |page= |pages=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Water sources==

The chotts of the Sahara are fed intermittently during periods of infrequent rainfall. They are subject to a high evaporation rate, hence salts eventually accumulate in the surface of the sediment. In fact, annual evaporation rates per year in chotts often exceed 20 times the annual precipitation rate.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Deserts and Desert Environments&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; This salt accumulation can lead chotts to have particularly high [[albedo]], albeit with comparable variability as well.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Deserts and Desert Environments&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; While [[evaporite]] deposition predominates on chotts, in more humid climatic periods, layers of mud can be deposited on the chott surface. When near a source of loose sand, [[Aeolian processes#Deposition|aeolian deposition]] can also play a role in the sedimentary deposition on the chott surface.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;The Geology of Mars: Evidence from Earth-Based Analogs&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1= Komatsu|first1= Goro|last2= Ori |first2= Gian Gabriele |last3= Marinangeli |first3= Lucia |last4= Moersch|first4= Jeffrey E. |authorlink= |editor= Chapman, Mary |editor-link=|encyclopedia= The Geology of Mars: Evidence from Earth-Based Analogs|title= Playa environments on Earth: Possible analogs for Mars |trans_title=|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=96N2Ik3ABRYC |accessdate=16 December 2012|language=|edition=5th |date=|year= 2007|month=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=|location=Chichester, UK |id= |isbn=0521832926 |oclc= |doi= |pages= |quote= |ref=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==The Sahara Sea==

As many lie below sea level, the chotts of the Sahara were viewed by some European colonialists and engineers as an opportunity to create an inland sea in the Sahara Desert (known by many as the &amp;quot;[[Sahara Sea]]&amp;quot;) by cutting a canal to the Mediterranean Sea (or in some cases, the Atlantic Ocean). Such a channel would allow water from the sea to flow inland. The hope was that this would facilitate trade and naval warfare, as well as change the climatic conditions of the Sahara.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;African Ecology&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |last=Spinage |first=Clive Alfred |authorlink= |title=African Ecology: Benchmarks and Historical Perspectives |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d3vOHF8PNKkC |accessdate=16 December 2012 |edition=Illustrated |series=Springer Geography |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=3642228712 |page= |pages=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Analogue to Martian landforms==
Chotts have also been studied because they are believed to be an Earth analogue to similar features on the planet [[Mars]]. Although there are considerable differences between terrestrial and [[Geology of Mars|Martian]] geology, some features on Mars are also believed to be evaporite basins, and consequently share at least some features of chotts. One example of a suspected Martian evaporite basin is [[Holden (Martian crater)|Holden Crater]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;The Geology of Mars: Evidence from Earth-Based Analogs&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
