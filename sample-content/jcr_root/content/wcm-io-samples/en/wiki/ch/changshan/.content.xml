In traditional Chinese dress, a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{Audio|Chang2shan1.ogg|changshan}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|t={{linktext|長|衫}}|s={{linktext|长|衫}}|p=chángshān|l=long shirt}}) is the male equivalent of the women&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[cheongsam]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;qipao&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). It is also known as a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;changpao&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;chángpáo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{linktext|长|袍}}) or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;dagua&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{linktext|大|褂}} dàguà).

The [[Mandarin Chinese]] word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;changshan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is cognate with the [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;chèuhngsàam&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which has been borrowed into English as &amp;quot;cheongsam&amp;quot;. Unlike the Mandarin term, however, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;chèuhngsàam&amp;apos;&amp;apos; can refer to both male and female garments, and in [[Hong Kong]] is frequently used for the body-hugging female garment rather than for the male &amp;apos;&amp;apos;changshan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The Hong Kong usage is reflected in the meaning of &amp;quot;cheongsam&amp;quot; in English, which refers exclusively to the female garment.

A similar [[Burma|Burmese]] garment, called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;taikpon eingyi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang|my|တိုက်ပုံအင်္ဂျီ}}) which is also a jacket featuring [[mandarin collar]]s, is part of formal attire for men at weddings and other formal functions. However, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;taikpon eingyi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is much more form-fitting than the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;changshan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, with sleeves that cut off at the wrist and typically made of silk cloth.

==History==
{{main|Cheongsam#History|l1=Cheongsam History}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Changshan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, along with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;qipao&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, were introduced to China during the [[Qing Dynasty]] (17th–20th centuries). The [[Manchu]]s in 1636 ordered that all [[Han Chinese]] should adopt the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;changshan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; style of dress or face harsh punishment. However, after the 1644 fall of the [[Ming Dynasty]], the Manchu stopped this order, and only required the court and government officials to wear Manchu clothes. Commoners were actually still allowed to wear the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[hanfu]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. However, over time, given the fact that the commoners still had to adopt Manchurian hairstyles or face execution, the commoners adopted the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;changshan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;qipao&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as their own dress.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |last=Rhoads |first=Edward J. M. |title=Manchus &amp;amp; Han: Ethnic Relations and Political Power in Late Qing and Early Republican China, 1861–1928 |year=2000 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |series=Studies on Ethnic Groups in China |isbn=9780295979380 |oclc=43569203 |page=61 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tgq1miGno-4C&amp;amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Thus, the traditional Chinese [[Han Chinese clothing|Hanfu]] style of clothing was gradually replaced. Over time, the Manchu style gained popularity.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Changshan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was formal dress for Chinese men before Western-style [[Suit (clothes)|suits]] became common in China.

The male &amp;apos;&amp;apos;changshan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; went well with the western overcoat, fedora, and scarf, and portrayed a unique [[East Asia]]n modernity.

The 1949 [[Chinese Civil War|Communist Revolution]] ended the wearing of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;changshan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and other similar clothing in [[Shanghai]], but [[Shanghainese people|Shanghainese]] emigrants and refugees brought the fashion to [[Hong Kong]] where it has remained popular. Recently there has been a revival of the Shanghainese &amp;apos;&amp;apos;changshan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in Shanghai and elsewhere in [[mainland China]]. It is made of silk.

==Use of changshan==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Changshan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are traditionally worn in pictures, weddings, and other more formal historically Chinese events.  A black &amp;apos;&amp;apos;changshan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, along with a rounded black hat, was, and sometimes still is, the burial attire for Chinese men.  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Changshan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are not often worn {{As of|2007|alt=today}} in mainland China, except during traditional Chinese celebrations but, with the revival of some traditional clothing in urban mainland China, the Shanghainese style functions as a stylish party dress (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;cf.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Mao suit]]).
