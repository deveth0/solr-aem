&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Charles d&amp;apos;Albert, Duke of Luynes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (5 August 1578 &amp;amp;ndash; [[Longueville, Lot-et-Garonne|Longueville]], 15 December 1621), was a [[favourite]] of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] who was made a [[Peer of France]] and [[Constable of France]] before dying at the height of his influence.

==Biography==
He was the first son of Honoré d&amp;apos;Albert (d. 1592), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;seigneur&amp;apos;&amp;apos; de [[Dukes of Luynes|Luynes]], who was in the service of the three last [[Valois Dynasty|Valois]] kings and of [[Henry IV of France]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=147}}

Charles was brought up at court and attended the [[Dauphin of France|dauphin]], later Louis XIII. The king shared his fondness for hunting and rapidly advanced him in favour. In 1615 he was appointed commander of the [[Louvre Palace]] and counsellor, and the following year [[Grand Falconer of France]]. He used his influence over the king in the court intrigues against the queen-mother [[Marie de&amp;apos; Medici]] and her favourite [[Concino Concini|Concini]]. It was Luynes who, with Vitry, captain of the guard, arranged the plot that ended in Concini&amp;apos;s assassination (1617) and secured all the latter&amp;apos;s possessions in [[Italy]] and France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=147}}

In the same year he was appointed captain of the [[Bastille]] and lieutenant-general of [[Normandy]], and married [[Marie de Rohan]], daughter of the [[duke of Montbazon]]. He employed extreme measures against the [[pamphlet]]eers of the time, but sought peace in Italy and with the [[Protestants]]. In 1619 he negotiated the [[Treaty of Angoulême]] by which Marie de&amp;apos; Medici was accorded complete liberty. He was made governor of [[Picardy]] in 1619; suppressed an uprising of nobles in 1620; and in 1621, with slight military ability or achievement, was appointed [[constable of France]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=147}}

His rapid rise to power made him a host of enemies, who looked upon him as but a second Concini. In order to justify his newly-won laurels, Luynes undertook an expedition against the Protestants, but died of a fever in the midst of the campaign, at [[Longueville]] in [[Guienne]], on 15 December 1621.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=147}}

==Family==
{{main|Dukes of Luynes}}
His brother [[Honoré d&amp;apos;Albert (1581-1649)]], first [[duke of Chaulnes]], was governor of [[Picardy]] and [[Marshal of France]] (1619), and defended his province successfully in 1625 and 1635.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=147}}
