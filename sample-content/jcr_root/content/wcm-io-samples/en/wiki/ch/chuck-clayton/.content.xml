}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chuck Clayton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[African-American]] [[teenager|teenage]] [[fictional character]] published by [[Archie Comics]]. Chuck lives in the fictional town of [[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale]], and is the friend of [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie Andrews]], [[Betty Cooper]], [[Jughead Jones]], and other students at Riverdale High School. Chuck first appeared in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pep Comics&amp;apos;&amp;apos; #257 in 1971.

Chuck was created as a means of adding diversity to the cast of Archie characters, though Valerie (of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Josie and the Pussycats]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) predates Chuck by several years.

==History==
Chuck is [[African American]] and the son of [[Coach Clayton|Floyd Clayton]], who works at Riverdale High School as the school&amp;apos;s coach, and Alice Clayton, a housewife.

In earlier stories, including his recurring appearances in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Archie at Riverdale High,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Chuck was usually shown as one of Riverdale High&amp;apos;s top athletes. Chuck was also depicted as a close friend of Archie, often spending time together or engaging in various adventures.

By the early 1990s, Chuck&amp;apos;s interest in cartooning was added to round out his character, and also serves to promote the comics he appears in. In modern stories, Chuck is depicted primarily as a cartoonist, whose greatest ambition is to someday become a professional comic book and comic strip illustrator. Despite the long hours he spends practicing his craft, he still finds time to participate in all of Riverdale highâ€™s varsity sports, study his own African-American heritage, and spend time with his girlfriend, [[Nancy Woods]].

==Relationships==
Chuck&amp;apos;s steady girlfriend is [[Nancy Woods]], one of the series&amp;apos; few steady couples. While Nancy shares some of Chuck&amp;apos;s interests in art, she often berates him for sometimes focusing more on his art than their relationship.

==In other media==
Chuck appeared in 1974&amp;apos;s animated Archie series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The U.S. of Archie&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and 1977&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The New Archie/Sabrina Hour&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. His voice was performed by [[Dal McKennon]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0036875/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Chuck also was shown in an Archie parody in an episode of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Robot Chicken]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, where he was derisively called a &amp;quot;[[tokenism|token]]&amp;quot; African-American character.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0883839/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
