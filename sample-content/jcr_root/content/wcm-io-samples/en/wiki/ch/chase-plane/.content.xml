A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;chase plane&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[aircraft]] that &amp;quot;chases&amp;quot; a &amp;quot;subject&amp;quot; aircraft, spacecraft or rocket, for the purposes of making real-time observations and taking air-to-air photographs and video of the &amp;quot;subject aircraft,&amp;quot; during flight.

Safety can be one function of a chase plane; others are to photograph or video the target vehicle, or to collect engineering data from it. Chase planes may be used during [[test flight]]s, and for many years the best way to ensure the safety of an [[experimental aircraft]] was to fly alongside it and observe the flight.

This &amp;quot;chase&amp;quot; airplane&amp;apos;s crew would keep a constant lookout for problems with the &amp;quot;subject&amp;quot; or test aircraft, and if problems did arise, they would provide warnings and critical information to the test aircraft&amp;apos;s crew, and to the mission controllers on the ground. They would also monitor the surrounding airspace for other aircraft that could pose a hazard to the flight, either by straying into their flightpath or threatening any kind of secrecy associated with that particular project.

Since the early days of [[USAF]] testing, the chase aircraft have been manned by [[test pilot]]s just like the experimental planes they accompany, providing a common language and bond between test pilot and observer. The experienced pilots in the chase aircraft could guide distressed test aircraft down to safe landings should experiments go wrong.
