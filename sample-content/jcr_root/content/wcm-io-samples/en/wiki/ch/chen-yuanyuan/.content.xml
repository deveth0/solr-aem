Her courtesy name was Wanfen ({{zh|c=畹芬}}). Her actual historical significance is disputed, although it is largely believed that Chen was pivotal in Wu Sangui&amp;apos;s campaigns after the fall of the Ming.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Chinese Literature, Volume 2  |year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85559-4|pages=179|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1jGz0qXPgM0C&amp;amp;pg=PA179&amp;amp;dq=%22Chen+Yuanyuan%22#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22Chen%20Yuanyuan%22&amp;amp;f=false}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; She was one of the [[Eight Beauties of Qinhuai]] (秦淮八艳).

==History==
Chen Yuanyuan was born to a peasant family, and on the death of her father, she became a courtesan. Due to her beauty and singing ability, she became a lead figure in opera in [[Suzhou]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;biography&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical dictionary of Chinese women|year=1998|publisher=East Gate|isbn=0-7656-0043-9|pages=21–26|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uwPWtJ5WSQMC&amp;amp;pg=PA25&amp;amp;dq=%22Chen+Yuanyuan%22#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22Chen%20Yuanyuan%22&amp;amp;f=false}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Fearing for her life due to an abduction attempt, she became the concubine of [[Mao Xiang]].

In 1642, Chen was abducted by the Tian Hongyu family where she became the singing courtesan. She then moved into the possession of [[Wu Sangui]], though how is unclear - she may have been purchased by Wu&amp;apos;s father&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;biography&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; or given as a gift by Tian.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;notable women&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

In April 1644, Beijing fell to a rebel army led by Li Zicheng.  Chongzhen gathered the entire imperial household and ordered them, except for his sons, to commit [[suicide]]. The Empress hanged herself.  [[Princess Changping]] refused.  In a fit of rage Chongzhen had her left arm cut off. He then fled to nearby Jingshan Park(景山公園), where he hanged himself on the famous [[Guilty Chinese Scholartree]] (罪槐). Chen Yuanyuan reluctantly assisted by helping him up to the [[noose]], according to some accounts.

Li established what he called the Shun Dynasty, but it fell to the Manchus at the end of May.  Seizing their chance, the Manchus crossed the [[Great Wall]] after Wu Sangui opened the gates at Shanhai Pass.  They quickly overthrew Li, who fled the Forbidden City.

Wu Sangui died during a rebellion against the [[Qing]] army, and his successor [[Wu Shifan]] committed suicide after being besieged by said army, Wu Shifan&amp;apos;s wife and Chen committed suicide together.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;biography&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
