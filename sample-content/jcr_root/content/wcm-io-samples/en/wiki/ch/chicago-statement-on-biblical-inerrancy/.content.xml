        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was formulated in October 1978 by more than 200 [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] leaders at a conference sponsored by the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy (ICBI), held in [[Chicago]].  The statement was designed to defend the position of [[Biblical inerrancy]] against a perceived trend toward [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] conceptions of [[Bible|Scripture]].  The undersigners came from a variety of evangelical [[Christian denomination]]s, and include [[James Montgomery Boice]], [[Carl F. H. Henry]], [[Kenneth Kantzer]], [[J. I. Packer]], [[Francis Schaeffer]], and [[R. C. Sproul]].

Leading inerrantists regard the Chicago Statement as a very thorough statement of what they mean by &amp;quot;inerrancy&amp;quot;. The statement elaborates on various details in Articles formed as couplets of &amp;quot;WE AFFIRM ...&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;WE DENY ...&amp;quot;.  Under the statement inerrancy applies only to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;original manuscripts&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (which no longer exist, but can be inferred on the basis of extant copies), not to the copies or translations themselves. In the statement, inerrancy does &amp;apos;&amp;apos;not&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refer to a blind literal interpretation, but allows for figurative, poetic and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] language, so long as it was the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;author&amp;apos;s intent&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to present a passage as literal or symbolic.

The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy has been compared to the Vatican Council Decree &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dei Verbum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which expounds similar teachings for Roman Catholics.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/octoberweb-only/143-11.0.html?start=1 Rome&amp;apos;s Battle for the Bible]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
