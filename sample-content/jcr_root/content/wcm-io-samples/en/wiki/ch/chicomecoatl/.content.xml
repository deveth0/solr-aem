In [[Aztec mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chicomecōātl&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPA-nah|t͡ʃikome&amp;apos;koːaːt͡ɬ||}} &amp;quot;seven snakes&amp;quot;, was the Aztec goddess of agriculture during the Middle Culture period. She is sometimes called &amp;quot;goddess of nourishment&amp;quot;, a goddess of plenty and the female aspect of corn. Every September a young girl representing &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chicomecōātl&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was sacrificed. The priests decapitated the girl, collected her blood and poured it over a figurine of the goddess. The corpse was then flayed and the skin was worn by a priest.

She is regarded as the female counterpart of the maize god &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Centeotl|Centeōtl]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, their symbol being an ear of corn. She is occasionally called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Xilonen]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (&amp;quot;the hairy one&amp;quot;, which referred to the hairs on unshucked maize), who was married also to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Tezcatlipoca]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

She often appeared with attributes of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Chalchiuhtlicue]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, such as her headdress and the short lines rubbing down her cheeks. She is usually distinguished by being shown carrying ears of maize. She is shown in three different forms:

* As a young girl carrying [[flower]]s
* As a woman who brings death with her embraces
* As a mother who uses the [[sun]] as a shield
