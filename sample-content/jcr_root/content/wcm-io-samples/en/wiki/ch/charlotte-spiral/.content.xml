The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;charlotte&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (pronounced &amp;apos;&amp;apos;shar-lot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), also known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;candle stick&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a [[figure skating]] [[spiral (figure skating)|spiral]]. The skater bends forward and glides on one leg with the other one lifted into the air. The skater&amp;apos;s torso is upright, but during the charlotte, the skater&amp;apos;s torso is as close to the grounded foot as possible. When performed well, the skater&amp;apos;s legs are almost in a straight [[Split (gymnastics)|vertical split]] position. The charlotte requires great flexibility and balance.

A charlotte can be performed either forward or backward. It is usually performed backwards, although some skaters have performed it forwards in competition.

The charlotte is named for [[Germany|German]] skater [[Charlotte Oelschlagel]], who first performed the move in the early 1900s. [[Michelle Kwan]] and [[Sasha Cohen]] are generally credited as bringing the move back into popularity during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The position is rarely performed by men, notable exceptions being [[Rohene Ward]] and a few others.
