&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chronic toxicity&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a property of a substance that has [[toxic]] effects on a living organism, when that organism is exposed to the substance continuously or repeatedly.  Compared with [[acute toxicity]].

Two distinct situations need to be considered:

* Prolonged exposure to a substance

For example if a person drinks too much [[alcohol]] on a regular basis then their health may suffer as a result. The alcohol does not have a long [[biological halflife]] but it is supplied on a regular basis to the body of the person.

* Prolonged internal exposure because a substance remains in the body for a long time

For example if a person were to ingest [[radium]] much of it would be absorbed into the bones where it would exert a harmful effect on a person&amp;apos;s health. The radium might cause a disturbance in the blood cell-forming part of the bone ([[bone marrow]])
