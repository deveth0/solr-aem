A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;skewer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a thin metal or wood stick used to hold pieces of food together. They are used while [[grilling]] or [[roasting]] meats, and in other culinary applications.

Metal skewers are typically stainless steel and will have a pointed tip on one end and a grip of some kind on the other end for ease of removing the food. When grilling, wooden skewers must be soaked to avoid burning.  Wooden skewers are often made from [[bamboo]]; however, other woods may be used.

==Other uses==

Small, often decorative, skewers of glass, metal, wood or bamboo known as &amp;quot;olive picks&amp;quot; are used for [[Cocktail garnish|garnishes]] on [[cocktail]]s and other [[alcohol]]ic beverages.

Many types of snack food are sold and served &amp;quot;on a stick&amp;quot; or skewer, especially at outdoor markets, fairs, and sidewalk or roadside stands.
