&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Skipp Porteous&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1944) is a former [[Evangelical]] Christian minister, now an outspoken critic of religious extremism of all kinds. A convert to Judaism, he has claimed that &amp;quot;man created God in his own image, and he doesn&amp;apos;t like the image.&amp;quot; {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

He has written about his life and experiences in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jesus Doesn&amp;apos;t Live Here Any More&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 1984, Porteous founded the Institute for First Amendment Studies with attorney Barbara Simon (ceased operating 2001).

Porteous formerly campaigned to expose and counter the political activities of the Religious Right.

In 2007, following his own investigation, Porteous claimed to have unmasked a former paratrooper and airline employee as being missing aircraft hijacker [[D. B. Cooper]]. His analysis and conclusions were featured in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[New York (magazine)|New York]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; magazine,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Gray, Geoffrey [http://nymag.com/news/features/39593/ Unmasking D.B. Cooper] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;New York Magazine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and later published in his own book, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Into the Blast: The True Story of D.B. Cooper&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 2010.

Porteous is retired and living in Rosebud, Alberta, Canada.
