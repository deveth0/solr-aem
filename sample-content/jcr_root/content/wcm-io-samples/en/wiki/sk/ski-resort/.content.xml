A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ski resort&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[resort]] developed for [[skiing]], [[snowboarding]], and other [[winter sports]].  In Europe a ski resort is a town or village in a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ski area&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - a mountainous area, where there are ski trails and other supporting services such as hotels, restaurants, equipment rentals, and a [[ski lift]] system.  In North America it is more common for ski areas to exist well away from towns, and the term ski resort is used for a [[destination resort]], often purpose-built and self-contained, where skiing is the main activity.  The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ski station&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is also used, particularly in Europe, for a skiing facility which is not located in or near a town or village.

Ski areas have marked paths for skiing known as runs, trails or [[piste]]s. Ski areas typically have one or more [[chairlift]]s for moving skiers rapidly to the top of hills, and to interconnect the various trails. [[Rope tow]]s can also be used on short slopes (usually beginner hills or bunny slopes). Larger ski areas may use [[gondola lift|gondolas]] or [[aerial tramway|aerial trams]] for transportation across longer distances within the ski area.

Some ski resorts offer lodging options on the slopes themselves, with ski-in and ski-out access allowing guests to ski right up to the door.  Ski resorts often have other activities, such as [[Snowmobile|snowmobiling]], [[sledding]], [[Sled|horse-drawn sleds]], [[Dog sled|dog-sledding]], [[Ice skating|ice-skating]], indoor or outdoor [[Swimming pool|swimming]], and [[hot tub|hottubbing]], game rooms, and local forms of entertainment, such as clubs, cinema, theatre and cabarets.

Ski areas usually have at least a basic [[first aid]] facility, and some kind of [[ski patrol]] service to ensure that injured skiers are rescued.  The ski patrol is usually responsible for rule enforcement, marking hazards, closing individual runs (if a sufficient level of hazard exists), and removing (dismissing) dangerous participants from the area.

A ski resort which is also open for summer activities is often referred to as a [[mountain resort]].
