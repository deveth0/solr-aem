&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yr Elen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[mountain]] in the [[Carneddau]] range in [[Snowdonia]], [[Wales]]. It is the ninth highest mountain in Snowdonia.  The average annual temperature of the peak is around 4 celsius. It lies on a short ridge running WNW off the main north-east to south-west ridge of the Carneddau, just over one kilometre from [[Carnedd Llewelyn]].

It is usually climbed from the main ridge of the Carneddau, as it is only a short walk from Carnedd Llywelyn. It can also be climbed from Gerlan, near [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]], following [[Afon Llafar]] then heading up the slopes of Yr Elen, but this involves walking through wet valleys and a number of rivers that are difficult to cross.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Gillham|first=John|title=The Pictorial Guide to the Mountains of Snowdonia 1: The Northern Peaks|year=2010|publisher=Frances Lincoln|isbn=978-0-7112-2973-0|pages=111|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z9cI8m0qz3sC&amp;amp;pg=PA111}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The [[etymology]] of the name is unclear, with the personal name &amp;quot;Helen&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Eleanor&amp;quot; being one possibility, perhaps after  [[Eleanor de Montfort]] (d. 1282), princess of Wales and wife of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]].  Another is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the leech&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (from [[soft mutation]] of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;gelen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[leech]]), perhaps in reference to the way in which Yr Elen appears to be attached to the side of the remaining Carneddau.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Nuttall, John &amp;amp; Anne (1999).
