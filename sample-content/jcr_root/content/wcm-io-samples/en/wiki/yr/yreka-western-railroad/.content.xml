The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yreka Western Railroad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{reporting mark|YW}} is an {{convert|8.86|mi|adj=on}} [[shortline railroad]] that operates [[freight train|freight]] and [[tourist train]]s between the [[Central Oregon and Pacific Railroad]] at [[Montague, CA|Montague]] and the city of [[Yreka, California]]. It began operations in 1935 on a line that was placed in service in 1889, and has remained independent of larger carriers.&amp;lt;ref name=shortline&amp;gt;Edward A. Lewis, American Shortline Railway Guide, 5th Edition, [[Kalmbach Publishing]], 1996, p. 346&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yreka Railroad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was incorporated in May 1888, with a capital stock of $100,000, to serve local [[mining|mine]]s,&amp;lt;ref name=ICC&amp;gt;[[Interstate Commerce Commission]], 108 I.C.C. 677 (1926): Valuation Docket No. 292, Yreka Railroad Company&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and opened in January 1889, connecting Yreka to the [[Southern Pacific Company]] lessor [[Central Pacific Railroad]] (ex-[[California and Oregon Railroad]]). In August 1933, the new Yreka Western Railroad was incorporated, and it took over the property in April 1935.&amp;lt;ref name=shortline/&amp;gt; The [[Central Oregon and Pacific Railroad]] acquired the SP connection at Montague in 1994.

==Operations==
In recent years the YW was owned by [[Kyle Railways]] and provided freight service and offered passenger train excursions.  The freight traffic is primarily wood chips and forest products.  Today the line is a tourist railroad and is owned and operated by the Rocky Mountain Railroad &amp;amp; Mining Museum of [[Denver, Colorado]].

In 1986 the YW started operating a steam passenger train excursion known as the &amp;quot;Blue Goose&amp;quot; between Yreka and Montague.  The &amp;quot;Blue Goose&amp;quot; continues to operate to this day.  The railroad offers scenic views of [[Mount Shasta]] and the [[Siskiyou Mountains]].  The trip takes about one hour in either direction, with a 60 to 90-minute layover in Montague depending on the number of passengers. While passengers explore and eat in Montague, the crew takes the train to perform a runaround move so the locomotive will pull the train back to Yreka.

The most famous locomotive on the line is [[2-8-2]] [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] 90 ton logging mikado #19. #19 is nicknamed &amp;quot;Pancho&amp;quot; to due to its time spent in Mexico in the 1920s and possible squabble with the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa. #19 has starred in many movies, the two most famous being &amp;quot;[[Emperor of the North]]&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;[[Stand By Me (film)|Stand By Me]]&amp;quot;. She was built in 1915 by Baldwin for the Caddow River Lumber Company in Arkansas. She served there until being sent to Mexico in 1920 where she is believed to have been converted to oil. In 1924 she was purchased by the [[McCloud River Railroad]]. She served many years there hauling log trains until being sold to the Yreka Western Railroad in 1953.

Other locomotives include [[EMD SW8|SW8]] #21, [[EMD SD9|SD9]] #439, and [[ALCO MRS-1]] #244. #21 (Former [[Southern Pacific]] #1115) is usually used in freight service, but is occasionally put into excursion service when the 19 needs repairs. The #21 is unique because it has dynamic brakes, not usually found on [[Switch engine|switching]] locomotives.
