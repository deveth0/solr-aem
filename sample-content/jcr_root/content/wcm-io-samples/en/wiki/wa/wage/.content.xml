A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;wage&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is [[remuneration]] paid by an [[employer]] to an [[employee]]. It may be calculated as a fixed task based amount, or at an hourly rate, or based on an easily measured quantity of work done. It is contrasted with [[salary|salaried work]], which is based on a fixed time period and with [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] which is based on performance.

==Determinants of wage rates==
Depending on the structure and traditions of different economies around the world, wage rates will be influenced by market forces ([[supply and demand]]), legislation, and tradition. Market forces are perhaps more dominant in the [[United States]], while tradition, [[social structure]] and [[seniority]], perhaps play a greater role in [[Japan]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://student.education2020.com/activities/vocab.aspx?keystr=12316&amp;amp;order=03020305&amp;amp;stbl=2196464] - Education 2020 Homeschool console, Vocabulary Assignment, definition entry for &amp;quot;wage rate&amp;quot; (may require login to view)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

===Wage Discrimination===
{{see also|Racial wage gap in the United States|Gender pay gap}}

Even in countries where market forces primarily set wage rates, studies show that there are still differences in remuneration for work based on sex and race. For example, according to the [[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]], in 2007 women of all races made approximately 80% of the median wage of their male counterparts. Similarly, white men made about 84% the wage of Asian men, and black men 64%.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

==Wages in the United States==
[[Image:US Real Wages 1964-2004.gif|thumb|Historical graph of [[real wages]] in the US from 1964 to 2005.]]

In the [[United States]], wages for most workers are set by [[Supply and demand|market forces]], or else by [[collective bargaining]], where a [[labor union]] negotiates on the workers&amp;apos; behalf. The [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] establishes a minimum wage at the federal level that all states must abide by, among other provisions. Fourteen states and a number of cities have set their own [[minimum wage]] rates that are higher than the federal level. For certain federal or state government contacts, employers must pay the so-called [[prevailing wage]] as determined according to the [[Davis-Bacon Act]] or its state equivalent.  Activists have undertaken to promote the idea of a [[Living wage|living wage rate]] which account for living expenses and other basic necessities, setting the living wage rate much higher than current [[minimum wage law]]s require.
