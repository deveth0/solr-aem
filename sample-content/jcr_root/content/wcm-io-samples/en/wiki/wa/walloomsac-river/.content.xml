It rises in southwestern [[Vermont]], in the [[Green Mountains]] east of the town of [[Bennington, Vermont|Bennington]] in [[Woodford, Vermont|Woodford Hollow]] at the confluence of Bolles Brook and City Stream where it is labeled Walloomsac Brook on maps&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;map1898&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://docs.unh.edu/VT/benn98sw.jpg 1898 topographical map of Bennington, VT]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;map1954&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://docs.unh.edu/VT/benn54sw.jpg 1954 topographical map of Bennington, VT]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; but is locally known as &amp;quot;The Roaring Branch&amp;quot;.  The river then flows west toward Bennington and passes the downtown area to the north.  For many years this section was intermittent due to the water having been diverted to power mills in town (ca. 1810).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bennhist&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.mollystarkbyway.org/town/bennington/history_in_the_making/ Molly Stark Byway, Bennington , History In The Making]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  This divergence gave the name Walloomsac to a portion of the river flowing through town on the present course of South Stream.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;map1898&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;map1954&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  The combined Walloomsac / South Stream joins the Roaring Branch northwest of town.  From here the river flows westward as the Walloomsac River and joins the Hoosic River below [[Hoosick Falls, New York]].
