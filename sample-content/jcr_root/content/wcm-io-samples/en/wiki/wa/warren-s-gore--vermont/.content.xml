&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Warren&amp;apos;s Gore&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Warrens Gore&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Warren Gore&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[gore (surveying)|gore]] in [[Essex County, Vermont|Essex County]], [[Vermont]], [[United States]]. The population was 10 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. In Vermont, gores and grants are unincorporated portions of a county which are not part of any town and have limited self-government (if any, as many are uninhabited).

Warren&amp;apos;s Gore is part of the [[Berlin, New Hampshire|Berlin]], [[New Hampshire|NH]]&amp;amp;ndash;VT [[Berlin micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
The gore was originally chartered to be part of the town of [[Warren, Vermont|Warren]] on October 20, 1789.  The charter provided for two tracts of land; one of which became the town, the other became the gore. The two tracts were quite a few miles from each other, on opposite sides of the state.  The tract that became the gore has been treated as separate from the town since its inception.  The charter referred to the two tracts collectively as &amp;quot;a Township by the name of Warren&amp;quot;. (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;State Papers of Vermont, Volume Two: Charters Granted by the State of Vermont&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, VT Secretary of State, 1922, pp.&amp;amp;nbsp;207–9, also p.&amp;amp;nbsp;362).

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the gore has a total area of 11.6&amp;amp;nbsp;square miles (30.0&amp;amp;nbsp;km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;), of which 10.9&amp;amp;nbsp;square miles (28.3&amp;amp;nbsp;km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) is land and 0.6&amp;amp;nbsp;square mile (1.7&amp;amp;nbsp;km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) (5.60%) is water.

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]] of 2000, there were 10 people, 4 households, and 4 families residing in the gore. The [[population density]] was 0.9 people per square mile (0.4/km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;). There were 43 housing units at an average density of 3.9/sq&amp;amp;nbsp;mi (1.5/km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;). The racial makeup of the gore was 100.00% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]].{{GR|2}}

There were 4 households out of which 25.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 100.0% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, and 0.0% were non-families. No households were made up of individuals and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.50 and the average family size was 2.50.{{GR|2}}

In the gore the population was spread out with 20.0% under the age of 18, 30.0% from 25 to 44, 30.0% from 45 to 64, and 20.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 46 years. For every 100 females there were 150.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.0 males.{{GR|2}}

==&amp;quot;Warren&amp;apos;s Gore&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Warren Gore&amp;quot;==
Sources are inconsistent on whether the name of the gore is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Warren&amp;apos;s Gore&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Warren Gore&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;State Papers of Vermont, Volume One: Index to the Papers of the Surveyors-General&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (VT Secretary of State, 1918) lists the name as &amp;quot;Warren&amp;apos;s Gore, one of two tracts in Vt. Grant to John Throop and associates, Oct. 27{{sic}}, 1789, as Warren.&amp;quot; (p.&amp;amp;nbsp;155, note: it appears the date should actually be Oct. 20, and is given as such on the same page under the entry for the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;town&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of Warren).

The Vermont Statutes use &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Warren&amp;apos;s Gore&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in at least two places (Title 17, Chapter 34, Section 1893 and T. 24,  Ch. 117, Sec. 4341(e)).  In at least one other place, however, the statutes use &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Warren Gore&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (T. 24, Ch. 1, Sec. 6).

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gazetteer of Caledonia and Essex Counties, VT, 1764-1887&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Hamilton Child, 1887) uses &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Warren&amp;apos;s Gore&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on p.&amp;amp;nbsp;15, but &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Warren Gore&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on p.&amp;amp;nbsp;490.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Vermont Road Atlas and Guide&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Northern Cartographic, 1989) uses &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Warren Gore&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (p.&amp;amp;nbsp;63) as does &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vermont Place-Names: Footprints of History&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by Esther M. Swift (The Stephen Greene Press, 1977, pp.&amp;amp;nbsp;222–3).

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vermont Atlas and Gazetteer&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Delorme, 9th ed., 1996) uses &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Warren Gore&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on the relevant map (p.&amp;amp;nbsp;55), but also uses &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Warrens Gore&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (with no apostrophe) for the gore&amp;apos;s entry in the index (p.&amp;amp;nbsp;7).
