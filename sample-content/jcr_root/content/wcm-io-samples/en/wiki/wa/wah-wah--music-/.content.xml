        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wah-wah&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;wa-wa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is an imitative word (or [[onomatopoeia]]) for the sound of altering the resonance of musical notes to extend expressiveness, sounding much like a human voice saying the syllable &amp;apos;&amp;apos;wah&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The wah-wah effect is a [[spectral glide]], a &amp;quot;modification of the [[vowel quality]] of a tone&amp;quot; (Erickson 1975, p.&amp;amp;nbsp;72), also known as a [[band pass filter]].{{Cn|date=June 2013}}&amp;lt;!--A source is needed for the extremely doubtful claim that &amp;quot;band pass filter&amp;quot; is synonymous with either &amp;quot;wah-wah&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;spectral glide&amp;quot;.--&amp;gt;

==Technique==
The wah-wah effect is produced by periodically bringing in and out of play [[Treble (sound)|treble frequencies]] while a note is sustained. The word is derived from the sound of the effect itself—in other words, it is onomatopoeic. The method of production varies from one type of instrument to another. On brass instruments, it is usually created by means of a [[Mute (music)|mute]], particularly with the harmon (also called a &amp;quot;wa-wa&amp;quot; mute) or plunger mute. Woodwind instruments may use &amp;quot;[[Fingering#Woodwind_instruments|false fingerings]]&amp;quot; to produce the effect. Any electrified instrument may us an auxiliary [[Signal processing|signal-processing]] device, usually operated by a [[Wah-wah pedal|pedal]]. This electronic means is most often thought of in connection with the electric guitar, but is also often used with the [[electric piano]] (Kernfeld 2002).

== Wah-wah in trumpet and trombone playing ==
This technique has been used in contemporary music. [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] notates the use of the wah-wah mute in his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Punkte]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1952/1962) in terms of transitions between open to close using open and closed circles connected by a line (Erickson 1975, p.&amp;amp;nbsp;73). Although the most common method of producing wah-wah on brass instruments is with a mute, some players have used electronic filtering, notably [[Miles Davis]] on trumpet (Kernfeld 2002).

== Wah-wah in electronic music ==
In [[electronic music]], wah-wah effects are easy to produce by controlling any number of filter types with a [[modulation]] [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] (Anon. 2007){{Failed verification|date=June 2013}}&amp;lt;!--This site says quite a lot of things, but it says nothing about ease of control or &amp;quot;modulation envelopes&amp;quot;, and not even whether the filter types described can be used for this purpose.--&amp;gt;.
