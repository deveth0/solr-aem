{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wave Race&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|ウエーブレース|Uēbu Rēsu}} is a 1992 [[personal watercraft]] racing video game developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo for the [[Nintendo]] [[Game Boy]]. It is the first game in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wave Race&amp;apos;&amp;apos; series. The game is relatively simple, in that the player controls a jet skier around a track aiming to beat the computer or up to three friends using the link cable accessory.

==Gameplay==
There are two modes in which the game may be played:

;Slalom:
The goal is to race through pairs of posts across the track.  Each one passed through increases the player&amp;apos;s score by one point.  The player with the most points once all posts have been taken wins.

;Race:
A race in which the player must proceed through certain checkpoints and complete each lap in a time limit.  Two powerups are available on the track.  The dolphin gives the player increased turning ability, while the octopus allows the recipient to steal  from opponents.

In both modes there are a variety of obstacles including ramps, shallow water and whirlpools.  There are eight tracks for each mode.

==Sequels==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wave Race&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sold well enough to earn a [[Player&amp;apos;s Choice]] medal and was later followed by two sequels: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wave Race 64]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wave Race: Blue Storm]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Unlike the first game, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wave Race 64&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wave Race: Blue Storm&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were also released in Japan.

==Reception==
{{VG Reviews

| NP = 3.7/5
