The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Walter Taylor Bridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[heritage-listed]] [[suspension bridge|suspension]] [[bridge]] crossing the [[Brisbane River]] between [[Indooroopilly, Queensland|Indooroopilly]] and [[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. It is shared by motor traffic and pedestrians and is the only habitable bridge in the Southern Hemisphere.

==Design==

The bridge is a similar design to the [[Hercilio Luz Bridge]] in [[Florianopolis]], [[Brazil]], with the [[truss]] carrying the bridge being above the roadway and meeting the cables at non-uniform heights.  This means that the suspension cables actually form the top chord of the truss, and this configuration is known as the Steinman (after its inventor) or Florianopolis type.&amp;lt;ref name=list&amp;gt;{{cite web

The bridge is unique among Brisbane bridges in that the two towers of the bridge house residential accommodation, which were occupied until mid 2010 when the last members of the original tollmaster&amp;apos;s family moved out. The Chelmer side of the bridge is bounded by a council park. A pontoon in this park was washed away in the 2011 flood, and has not yet been replaced (April 2013). The Walter Taylor Bridge is one of four bridges in close proximity to each other. The others are the [[Albert Bridge, Brisbane|Albert Bridge]], [[Indooroopilly Railway Bridge, Brisbane|Indooroopilly Railway Bridge]], and the [[Jack Pesch Bridge, Brisbane|Jack Pesch Bridge]].

==History==
[[File:StateLibQld 1 52980 Official opening of the Indooroopilly Toll Bridge, Brisbane, 1936.jpg|left|thumb|Official opening of the Indooroopilly Toll Bridge, Brisbane, 1936.]]
The bridge was conceived, designed, built and funded by local visionary [[Walter Taylor (contractor)|Walter Taylor]], a contractor who lived in [[Graceville, Queensland|Graceville]] (adjacent to the suburb in Chelmer). Although there was a rail bridge to Indooroopilly and beyond to the northern suburbs of Brisbane, local residents were frustrated because there was no means by which cars could cross the river. Pedestrians had been able to cross the river on the 2 previous [[Albert Bridge, Brisbane|Albert Bridge]]s from 1875â€“1893, and from 1895 until the opening of the Walter Taylor Bridge&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bnepp&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

The bridge was opened on 14 February 1936 by the Governor of [[Queensland]], Sir [[Leslie Orme Wilson|Leslie Wilson]]. The bridge was operated as a toll bridge until the 1960s, with a toll collection booth located at the Northern (Indooroopilly) end (see the video link below).  During that time, the bridge was known as the &amp;quot;Indooroopilly Toll Bridge&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=list /&amp;gt; After Walter Taylor&amp;apos;s death in 1955, the bridge was renamed the Walter Taylor Bridge in his honour.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bnepp&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.yourbrisbanepastandpresent.com/2011/02/walter-taylor-bridge-indooroopilly.html Brisbane Past and Present: Walter Taylor Bridge]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The bridge is a suspension bridge and the support cables were actually surplus support cables used to hold up the incomplete halves of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] during its construction. When the bridge opened it had the longest span of any suspension bridge in [[Australia]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=The Brisbane River: A pictorial history |last=Longhurst |first=Robert |coauthors=William Douglas  |publisher=W.D.

==Heritage listing==
The bridge was listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] in 1992.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite QHR|14956|Walter Taylor Bridge|accessdate=5 July 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
