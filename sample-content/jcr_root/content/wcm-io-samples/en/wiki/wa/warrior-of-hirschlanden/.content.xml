The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Warrior of Hirschlanden&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[statue]] of a nude [[phallic symbol|ithyphallic]] [[warrior]] made of [[sandstone]], the oldest known [[Iron Age]] life-size anthropomorphic statue north of the Alps. It was a production of the [[Hallstatt culture]], probably dating to the 6th century BC. It is now in the [[Landesmuseum Württemberg|Württembergisches Landesmuseum]] in [[Stuttgart]].

==Height==

The preserved height is 1.50 m.

==History==
The feet have been broken off.

The warrior wears a pointed hat, maybe – in analogy to the princely grave of [[Hochdorf Chieftain&amp;apos;s Grave|Hochdorf]] – made of birchbark, a neck-ring ([[torc]]) and a belt with a typical late Hallstatt dagger.

While the legs are modelled according to life, the upper body is rather schematic and the face is extremely sketchy, leading to discussions that the man might be wearing a mask, as is known from burials in Klein-Klein, Styria, Austria, [[Trebeništa]] (Macedonia) and the much earlier shaft-graves of [[Mycenae]], ca. 1500 BC.

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] influence (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Kouros|kouroi]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) has been discussed. Numerous black figure vessels from fortified settlements of the period attest trading contacts with the Mediterranean, probably via the [[Rhône River]] and the Greek colony of [[Marseilles|Massilia]] ([[Marseille]]). Much closer stylistic connections exist with the far more elaborate statues from [[Capestrano]], Picenium, [[Italy]] (650-550 BC) and Casale Marittimo (middle of the 7th century).

The statue was found in Hirschlanden (now [[Ditzingen]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]) in 1963 when a low [[tumulus|barrow]] was excavated. The barrow was surrounded by a [[stone circle]] and a [[dry stone wall]]. It contained 16 burials, ranging from the very beginning of the Iron Age (Hallstatt D1, ca. 600 BC) to the beginning of the Late Iron Age ([[La Tène culture|La Tène]] period, ca. 450 BC). The statue was found north of the barrow, but is supposed to have been originally placed on the top.

The statue shows significant weathering, suggesting that it stood exposed to the elements for a long time before being buried.

Other anthropomorphic statues of the early Iron Age have been found in Rottenburg, Tübingen, Stammheim and Stockach (all Baden-Württemberg, Germany), but they are far more stylised, more carving than statue.

In the following La Tène period, anthropomorphic statues are far more common, examples include the finds from the [[Glauberg]] (Hessen, Germany), Holzgerlingen (Baden-Württemberg, Germany) and Mšecke Žehrovice (Bohemia).
