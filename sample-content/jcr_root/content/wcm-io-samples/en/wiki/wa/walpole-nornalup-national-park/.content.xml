&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Walpole-Nornalup National Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a national park in the [[South West (Western Australia)|South West region]] of [[Western Australia]] ([[Australia]]), 355&amp;amp;nbsp;km south of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. It is famous for its towering [[Karri]] and Tingle trees. [[Eucalyptus jacksonii|Red Tingle]] trees are unique to the Walpole area.

==Tourism==
The &amp;apos;Valley of the Giants&amp;apos; is one of the main tourist draws in the area. Those with a head for heights can get a tree top view on the &amp;apos;Tree Top Walk&amp;apos; a 40&amp;amp;nbsp;m high walk-way that can accommodate wheelchairs. Most similar canopy walks around the world are constructed using [[suspension bridge]]-type structures — not for the faint of heart. The Tree Top Walk, however, is a series of sixty-metre, lightweight steel trusses built on steel pylons to form a secure ramp. Beneath the canopy walk there is a pathway around the Tingle trees for walkers — this is known as the &amp;apos;Ancient Empire&amp;apos;.

==Environment==

The Tingle tree has evolved to cope with [[Bushfires|bush fires]] and can withstand low level fires. The Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia (CALM) carries out fuel reduction [[Controlled burn|backburning]] in the national park; this limits the risk of a large scale bush fire by reducing the amount of dry leaf litter on the ground. Tingles can look completely burned in the inside but continue to survive as they grow from just under the layer of outside bark.

The park also extends to the coast, providing a range of habitats from forest to coastal heathland featuring swamp paperbark and a red flowering gum which is endemic to the region. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Conspicuous Cliff&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of the few places the coast is accessible in the National Park.

The [[Bibbulmun Track]] winds through the park to the coast.
