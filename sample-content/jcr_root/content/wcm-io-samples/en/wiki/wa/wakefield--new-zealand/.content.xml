The small New Zealand community of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wakefield&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is situated some 25&amp;amp;nbsp;km south west of [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] at the top of the [[South Island]].

First settled in about 1843, it was originally called Pitfure.  However the name was soon changed to Wakefield. This name was after the town of [[Wakefield]] in [[Yorkshire]], and not, as many assume, after Captain [[Arthur Wakefield]] who led the expedition that first established Nelson City and Province.

Wakefield is notable for Wakefield Primary School, the oldest school in continuous usage in New Zealand. It was set up in 1843 by Mary Ann Baigent, the wife of [[Edward Baigent]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Our School|url=http://www.wakefield.school.nz/our-school/|publisher=Wakefield School|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; St John&amp;apos;s Church in 120 Edward Street, built in 1864, is New Zealand&amp;apos;s second oldest surviving church. It is registered by the [[New Zealand Historic Places Trust]] as a Category I heritage structure, with registration number 40.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{NZHPT|40|St John&amp;apos;s Church (Anglican)|11 May 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Wakefield comes under the responsibility of the [[Tasman District]] Council, which has its offices in the nearby town of [[Richmond, New Zealand|Richmond]]. It is part of the West-Coast Tasman General Electorate.

There is a small [[newspaper|paper]] called the Wakefield Village News published monthly and distributed to the community.
