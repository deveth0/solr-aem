&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Waychinicup National Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a in [[Western Australia]] ([[Australia]]), {{convert|404|km|mi|0}} southeast of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and {{convert|65|km|mi|0}} east of Albany and extends as far Cheynes Beach near [[Bremer Bay]]. Facilities at the park include a camping area and bush toilet near the inlet of the [[Waychinicup River]]. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiassouthwest.com/en/Natural+Wonders/Waychinicup+National+Park.htm|title=Australia&amp;apos;s South West - Waychinicup National Park|year=2007|accessdate=6 June 2007}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The park offers and array of landscapes from the rugged coast to boulder strewn hilltops. Tree filled deeply incised [[valley]]s have fresh water streams flowing through them and are covered in [[moss]] covered boulders.
The park is bordered by the [[Southern Ocean]] to the south, [[Mount Manypeaks (Western Australia)|Mount Manypeaks]] Nature Reserve to the east and agricultural land to the north. The coastline of the park is enclosed between Normans Beach and Cheynes Beach.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cloudninespachalets.com.au/page_2.html|title=Rainbow Coast - Great Southern Attractions|year=2010|accessdate=12 November 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Fauna ==
The park is home to some of the rarest animals in Australia. Some of the species found in the park include [[Quenda]], [[Ring tailed possum]]s and one of the few mainland populations of [[Quokka]]s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/component/option,com_hotproperty/task,view/id,102/Itemid,755/|title=Department of Environment - Waychinicup National Park|year=2007|accessdate=6 June 2007}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The park forms part of the [[Two Peoples Bay and Mount Manypeaks Important Bird Area]], identified as such by [[BirdLife International]] because of its significance in the conservation of several rare and threatened bird species.&amp;lt;ref name=bli&amp;gt;BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Two Peoples Bay and Mount Manypeaks. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 18 November 2011.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The critically endangered [[Noisy Scrub-bird]], which was once thought to be [[extinct]], is found within the park; a small population of 14 were translocated from [[Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve]] in 1983, followed by another 16 in 1985. By 1994 it was estimated that 223 male birds had been heard singing in the area.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/recovery/noisy-scrub-bird/measures.html|title=Noisy Scrub-bird (Atrichornis clamosus) Recovery Plan|year=2007|accessdate=6 June 2007}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The [[Western Bristlebird]] is another vulnerable species that is found within the park. Most of the birds remaining population is found in [[Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve]] and Waychinicup National Park.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=515|title=Dasyornis longirostris — Western Bristlebird|year=2010|accessdate=6 June 2007}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Population]]s of the bird that have been on the decline since the late 19th century has started to stabilise.
