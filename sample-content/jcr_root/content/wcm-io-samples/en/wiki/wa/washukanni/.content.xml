        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Washukanni&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Waššukanni&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was the capital of the [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] kingdom of [[Mitanni]], from c. 1500 BC to the 13th century BC. Its precise location is unknown, it may be however located under the so-far unexcavated mound of [[Tell el Fakhariya]], near [[Tell Halaf]] in [[Syria]], to the east of the [[Euphrates]] river.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

According to a theory, Washukanni (waşuk-kani) (in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] xweşik-kanî) means &amp;apos;&amp;apos;beautiful source&amp;apos;&amp;apos;/&amp;apos;&amp;apos;springhead&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The Kurdish town [[Sikan]] (which scholars believe, its Washukkani) is named as [[Serêkanî]] or Serêkaniyê in modern Kurdish and it means &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Headwater&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.{{fact|date=April 2013}}

The city is known to have been sacked by the [[Hittites]] under [[Suppiluliumas I]] (reigned c.1344–1322 BC) in the first years of his reign, whose treaty inscription&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Suppiluliuma-Shattiwaza treaty excerpts. [[GeoCities]], archived at [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/farfarer2001/hittite_letters/suppiluliuma_shattiwaza_treaty.htm&amp;amp;date=2009-10-25+22:04:07 webcitation.org] and [http://web.archive.org/web/20091019170511/http://geocities.com/farfarer2001/hittite_letters/suppiluliuma_shattiwaza_treaty.htm archive.org]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; relates that he installed a Hurrian vassal king, [[Shattiwaza]]. The city was sacked again by the [[Assyria]]n king [[Adad-nirari I]] around 1290 BC, but very little else is known of its history.
