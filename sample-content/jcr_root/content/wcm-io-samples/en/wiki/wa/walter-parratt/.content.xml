==Biography==
Born in [[Huddersfield]], son of a parish organist, Parratt began to play the [[pipe organ]] from an early age, and held posts as an organist while still a child.  He was child prodigy: on one occasion he played [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]&amp;apos;s complete &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by heart, without notice, at the age of only ten.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Grove&amp;apos;s Dictionary, 5th edition, 1954, Vol. 6, p. 559&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

From 1854 to 1861 he was an organist at St Paul&amp;apos;s Church in his native town and, as successor to [[John Stainer]], in 1872 at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he remained for ten years.
From 1882 he held the post of organist of [St. George&amp;apos;s Chapel, Windsor Castle]. He became [[Heather Professor of Music]] at [[Oxford University]] in 1908, taking over from [[Hubert Parry]]. He had previously been Organist and Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford.

He became one of the foremost organ teachers of his day, with many important posts in Britain being filled by his students. He was president of the [[Royal College of Organists]].

Parratt was also a distinguished chess player, and was able to simultaneously play chess and a complex organ piece--at first sight.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite journal

He was [[knight]]ed in 1892.  In 1893 he was appointed [[Master of the Queen&amp;apos;s Music|Master of the Queen&amp;apos;s Musick]] to [[Queen Victoria]], and afterward held the same office under Kings [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=27363 |date=8 October 1901 |startpage=6569}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]].

Later honours included: Member (MVO, 1901), Commander (CVO, 1917), and Knight Commander (KCVO, 1921) of the [[Royal Victorian Order]].

After Parratt&amp;apos;s death in 1924 a monument to him was erected in the grounds of Huddersfield Parish Church.
