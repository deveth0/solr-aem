&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wallace Foster Davenport&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (30 June 1925 – 18 March 2004) was a [[United States]] [[jazz]] [[trumpeter]]. Davenport has been one of the few [[traditional jazz]] musicians of the 1930s who later branched out into [[Swing (genre)|swing]] and [[bebop|bop]] styles, as well as backing [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;amp;B]] vocalists during an extensive career in eight different decades.

Davenport was born in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. He started on [[trumpet]] at age 13 with [[The Young Tuxedo Brass Band]]. He played with [[Papa Celestin]] in 1941 before leaving New Orleans to serve in the [[U. S. Navy]]. Davenport returned there after the [[World War II]], making an easy transition to swing and bop with various bands. He recorded with [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]] in 1947. During the 1950s he toured the USA and [[Europe]] playing with [[Lionel Hampton]], and recorded in Paris in the mid-&amp;apos;50 with [[Mezz Mezzrow]].

Davenport played and recorded with the [[Count Basie]] jazz orchestra (1964–1966), and also toured with singers [[Ray Charles]] and [[Lloyd Price]]. In 1969 he went back to doing traditional jazz in New Orleans, and issued recordings of his groups playing this style from on his own label &amp;apos;&amp;apos;My Jazz&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1971–1976); recorded again in Europe with [[George Wein]] in 1974, with [[Panama Francis]] and [[Arnett Cobb]] in 1976, and also reunited with Hampton and recorded with [[Earl Hines]] this same year. In the eighties, Davenport worked with both traditional units as [[The Alliance Hall Dixieland Band]] and gospel groups like [[The Zion Harmonizers]] and [[Aline White]], and backed the vocalists [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] However, he routinely went on impromptu tours in Asia and Europe, and once played expressly for the king [[Olav V of Norway]].

A cultural icon of New Orleans, Davenport played regularly at the [[New Orleans Jazz &amp;amp; Heritage Festival]] and the [[French Quarter Festival]]. He received numerous awards and recognitions for his musical contributions from the city government and local arts groups.

Wallace Davenport died in New Orleans, Louisiana, at 78 years of age.
