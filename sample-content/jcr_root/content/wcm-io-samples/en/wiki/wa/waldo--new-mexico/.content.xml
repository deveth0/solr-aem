&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Waldo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[unincorporated area]] in [[Santa Fe County, New Mexico|Santa Fe County]], [[New Mexico]], [[United States]].  It was created along the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] just west of [[Cerrillos, New Mexico|Cerrillos]]. Today little remains, although the name appears on a freeway exit on Interstate 25 some distance to the west. Today, Waldo is a siding along the line of the [[BNSF Railway]], which bought out the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.

Waldo was at the junction of the AT&amp;amp;SF main east-west line and the [[Madrid, New Mexico|Madrid]] spur. There were [[coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens in Waldo, supplied by [[coal]] from Madrid. The spur itself no longer exists. The ovens were on the south side of the mail line, and the town on the north. The rail line parallels the [[Galisteo River]].
