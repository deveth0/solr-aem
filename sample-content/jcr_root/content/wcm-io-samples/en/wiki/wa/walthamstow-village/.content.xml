&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Walthamstow Village&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an ancient nucleus of present day [[Walthamstow]], located in North East [[London]]. Designated a [[Conservation Area]] by the [[London Borough of Waltham Forest]] in 1967, it centres around [[St. Mary&amp;apos;s Church, Walthamstow|St. Mary&amp;apos;s Church]], which was founded in the 12th century. Across the road from this is a 15th-century [[timber framing|timber-framed]] &amp;quot;[[hall house]]&amp;quot; which locals have dubbed &amp;quot;The Ancient House&amp;quot;. Nearby are [[almshouse]]s dating from the 16th and 18th centuries, and &amp;quot;Vestry House&amp;quot;, which has been used as a [[workhouse]] and police station, but has been a museum since 1931.

Orford Road, the ancient road leading up to St Mary&amp;apos;s church, has in recent years developed as an attractive street of small restaurants, cafes and an upmarket local supermarket.

The area has been described by the London Metropolitan Police as &amp;apos;a notably affluent area of the ward&amp;apos;.
