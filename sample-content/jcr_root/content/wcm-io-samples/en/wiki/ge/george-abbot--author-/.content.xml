&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;George Abbot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ca. 1603? &amp;amp;ndash; 2 February 1648) was an  [[England|English]] writer, known as &amp;quot;The Puritan&amp;quot; and a politician who sat in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] in two periods between 1640 and 1648.

==Life==
Abbot was son or grandson (it is not clear which) of Sir Thomas Abbot of [[Easington, East Riding of Yorkshire|Easington]], East [[Yorkshire]] and his mother (or grandmother) was of the ancient house of Pickering. He matriculated from [[King&amp;apos;s College, Cambridge]] in 1622.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Venn|id=ABTS622G|name=Abbotts or Abbot, George}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In April 1640, he was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Tamworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Tamworth]] in the [[Short Parliament]].&amp;lt;ref name=Willis&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=5V09AAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=%22Browne+Willis%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=NlR4ZTzW3S&amp;amp;sig=Pm35du8puwXQ6zQe811JbwnjHIc&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=01hsTJKDKpGj4QaR55XZAg&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=6&amp;amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false Browne Willis &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Notitia parliamentaria, or, An history of the counties, cities, and boroughs in England and Wales: ... The whole extracted from mss. and printed evidences&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1750 pp 229–239]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  In the [[English civil war]], he made a notable defence of the house at [[Caldecote, Warwickshire]], which he had acquired through marriage. On 15 August 1642, with eight men, his mother and maids, he held out against Princes [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Rupert]] and [[Prince Maurice von Simmern|Maurice]] with 18 troops of horses and dragoons.&amp;lt;ref name=Nichols&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=BwgPAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA236&amp;amp;lpg=PA236&amp;amp;dq=%22George+Abbot%22+Purefoy&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=_ilZH3XQ7L&amp;amp;sig=5F1DRDHlxk87qH1JhQXsy4qyqk4&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=weHGTdq4I8-r8AOgocT2Bw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=4&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22George%20Abbot%22%20Purefoy&amp;amp;f=false John Nichols &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The history and antiquities of Hinckley, in the County of Leicester&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was re-elected MP for Tamworth in 1645 for the [[Long Parliament]] and held the seat until his death in 1648.&amp;lt;ref name=Willis/&amp;gt;

==Works==
Abbot was a [[lay theologian]] and scholar of critical ability. His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Whole Booke of Job Paraphrased, or made easy for any to understand&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1640, quarto), was written in a terse style which contrasts with the usual wordiness of the Puritan expositors and commentators.  His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vindiciae Sabbathi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1641, octavo) had a profound and lasting influence in the long [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbatarian]] controversy. His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Brief Notes upon the Whole Book of Psalms&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1651, quarto) was published posthumously.

Abbot died in his 44th year and was buried in Charlecote church where his monument describes his defence of Charlecote.&amp;lt;ref name=Nichols/&amp;gt;

Abbot married a daughter of [[William Purefoy|Colonel Purefoy]] of Caldecote.&amp;lt;ref name=Nichols/&amp;gt;

==Mistaken identifications==
Abbot has been confused with others of the same name and has been described as a clergyman, which he never was. His writings have been incorrectly attributed in the bibliographical authorities to a relation of  [[George Abbot (bishop)|George Abbot]] the [[archbishop of Canterbury]]. One of the sons of [[Sir Morris Abbot]] called [[George Abbotts|George]] was also an MP in the Short Parliament.
