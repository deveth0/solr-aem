&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Georgia Day&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the [[holiday]] which the [[U.S. state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] recognizes in honor of its [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial]] founding as the [[Province of Georgia]].  On February 12, 1733, [[James Oglethorpe]] landed the first [[settler]]s in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ann&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, at what was to become Georgia&amp;apos;s first [[city]] (and later the first [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]]), [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].  Not a [[public holiday]], it was created by Georgia&amp;apos;s General Assembly, which provided that Feb. 12, &amp;quot;the anniversary of the landing of the first colonists in Georgia under Oglethorpe&amp;quot;â€”be observed in the public schools as Georgia Day.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/gabirthday.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The law was never repealed, but was not included in the code when it was officially compiled in 1981. Its official legal status is unclear.

Georgia Day is now observed on or around February 12 at the Georgia Day Parade hosted by the [[Georgia Historical Society]] as part of the Georgia History Festival, a two-week celebration of Georgia history.
