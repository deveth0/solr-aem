        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;George Ramsay Cook&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Order of Canada|OC]], [[Royal Society of Canada|FRSC]] (born November 28, 1931 in [[Alameda, Saskatchewan|Alameda]], [[Saskatchewan]]), is a [[Canada|Canadian]] historian and general editor of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  He was [[professor]] of [[history]] at [[York University]] for 25 years until 1996. Through his championing of so-called &amp;quot;limited identities&amp;quot;, Cook contributed to the rise of the New Social History, which uses &amp;quot;class, gender and ethnicity&amp;quot; as its three main categories of analysis. Cook&amp;apos;s conception of &amp;quot;limited identities&amp;quot; was famously formulated in an article in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;International Journal&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1967, Canada&amp;apos;s [[Canadian Centennial|centenary year]], reviewing the state of contemporary scholarship on [[Canadian nationalism]]:

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt; After six new books on the great Canadian problem — our lack of
unity and identity — are we getting any nearer the source of the problem?
Undoubtedly something is achieved: if nothing else one can wonder if the
search is worth the effort. Certainly we should continue to try to understand
ourselves; an unexamined nation is not worth living in. But it
may be that the frame of reference is wrong. Perhaps instead of constantly
deploring our lack of identity, we should attempt to understand
and explain the regional, ethnic and class identities that we do have. It
might just be that it is in these limited identities that &amp;quot;Canadianism&amp;quot; is
found, and that except for our over-heated nationalist intellectuals,
Canadians find this situation quite satisfactory.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ramsay Cook, &amp;quot;Canadian Centennial Cerebrations,&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;International Journal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Vol. 22, No. 4 (Autumn, 1967), 663.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

During his teaching career, Cook supervised the work of many prominent social historians such as [[Franca Iacovetta]].

In 1997, the Ramsay Cook Research Scholarship was established at York University to honour his contribution to the field of history.

He publicly supported [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]] in his attempt to gain the leadership of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] in 1968.

He is married to Eleanor Cook, an [[English studies|English]] [[professor]] at the [[University of Toronto]]
