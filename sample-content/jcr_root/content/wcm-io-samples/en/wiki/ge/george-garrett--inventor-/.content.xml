&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;George William Littler Garrett&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (4 July 1852 – 26 February 1902) was a British clergyman and inventor who pioneered submarine design.

==Early life==
He was brought up in [[Moss Side]] in [[Manchester]], England, the son of an Irish-born [[Church of England]] curate. He attended [[Rossall School]] and then [[Manchester Grammar School]], then studied Chemistry and General Science at [[Victoria University of Manchester|Owens College]] (also in Manchester) before attending [[Trinity College, Dublin]].  He was appointed assistant master at the [[Manchester Mechanics&amp;apos; Institute]] and subsequently obtained a BA degree.

In 1873, he passed the Cambridge Theological Examination and became a curate in his father&amp;apos;s parish.

==Inventions==

He invented a diving suit in 1877, demonstrating it to the [[France|French]] government in the [[River Seine]].

An interest in the possible military application of what at the time were known as [[submarine]] boats prompted him to form the Garrett Submarine Navigation and Pneumataphore Company Limited and raise £10,000 through it from Manchester businessmen. (A pneumataphore was a device for removing [[carbon dioxide]] from the air).

In 1878, he built a {{convert|14|ft|m|sing=on}} long hand-cranked submarine of about 4.5 tons, which he named the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Resurgam&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This was followed by the second (and more famous) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Resurgam]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of 1879.  It was {{convert|45|ft|m}} long, displaced about 30 tons on the surface and 38 tons submerged and was powered by steam - the furnace and chimney being shut off before diving.

It was not very practical - the boiler full of superheated water made conditions inside the submarine very hot indeed, and in common with many early submarine inventors he had not overcome the problems of longitudinal stability.

Nevertheless, although the submarine was lost whilst under tow in 1880, it impressed the [[Sweden|Swedish]] industrialist [[Thorsten Nordenfelt]] sufficiently to finance him.

Together, they built a submarine for [[Greece]], and two for [[Turkey]] - Garrett was commissioned as a Commander in the [[Ottoman Navy|Imperial Ottoman Navy]] for carrying out trials in these submarines. All of them suffered from severe stability problems.  A further submarine was built for [[Russia]] but ran aground off [[Jutland]] on the way there and the Russians refused to pay for it.

==Final years==
After this, Nordenfelt and Garrett parted company. Garrett emigrated to the United States, where he lost his savings in a failed farm in [[Florida]]. He then joined the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] and was promoted to corporal. He became a U.S. citizen and died in [[New York City]] in 1902.
