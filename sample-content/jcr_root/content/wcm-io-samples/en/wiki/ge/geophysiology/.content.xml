        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Geophysiology&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Geo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[earth]] + &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[physiology]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the study of living bodies) is the study of interaction among living organisms on the Earth operating under the hypothesis that the Earth itself acts as a single living organism.

The term &amp;quot;geophysiology&amp;quot; was popularized by [[James Lovelock]] in his writings on the [[Gaia theory (science)|Gaia hypothesis]]. The term was in fact foreshadowed by many others.  [[James Hutton]] (1726-1797), the &amp;quot;Father of Geology&amp;quot; in 1789, in a lecture presented on his behalf by Dr. Black, wrote &amp;quot;I consider the Earth to be a super-organism and that its proper study should be by physiology.&amp;quot;  This view that the Earth in some ways could be viewed as a [[superorganism]] was widely held in the early 19th century, and was supported even by such early biologists as [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] (1825-1895).  An analogous alternative geophysiology which views the Earth as a single cell was developed by [[Lewis Thomas]] in his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Lives of a Cell: Notes of a Biology Watcher&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1974).

[[Vladimir Vernadsky]] (1863-1945), founder of [[biogeochemistry]] suggested that geophysiological processes were responsible for the development of the Earth through a succession of phases in which the [[geosphere]] (of inanimate matter) develops into the [[biosphere]] (of biological life). Vernadsky&amp;apos;s thinking significantly influenced the development of [[ecology]] in [[Russia]], culminating in the &amp;quot;Russian Paradigm&amp;quot; (a term first coined by Georgii A. Zavarzin in 1995). The basic tenets of this approach are i) that life can only exist in the form of interconnected [[nutrient cycle|nutrient cycles]] (i.e. the [[ecosystem]]); ii) that ecosystem assembly is an organized process as opposed a haphazard one; iii) that the [[abiogenesis|emergence of life]] on earth was congruent with respect to the appearance of primordial nutrient cycles; iv) that in addition to the [[evolution]] of species there exists a separate process of ecological evolution the direction of which is predetermined by [[community (ecology)|community]] composition and dynamics (Lekevičius, 2006).

[[Frederic Clements]] (1874-1945) of the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institute]] of Washington, who popularized the idea of vegetation [[climax community|climax]] also introduced the idea of physiology to [[ecology]], considering the interlocking natures of plants and animals as [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes within a single superorganism.

The British biologist, Arthur Tansey (1871-1955), who introduced the term ecosystem, also considered the possibility that plant communities could be considered to be boundary-less quasi-organisms, although he never extended his ideas to a planetary scale.

G. Evelyn Hutchison, studied the way [[logistic growth]], biological [[feedback]] [[systems]] and [[Autoregulation|self-regulation]] tended to explain many of the features of ecological systems, and Raymond Lindeman has further extended the way energy flows between various [[trophic level]]s in his &amp;quot;trophic-dynamic&amp;quot; model, further developed by [[Mark McMenamin]] and Dianna McMenamin&amp;apos;s thesis of &amp;quot;Hypersea&amp;quot;, which looks at the rate of water flow through the Gaian biological environment. [[Tyler Volk]], has also looked at the trophic cycling of various elements upon which life depends, and argues that this is central to an understanding of geophysiology.

[[Eugene Odum]] believed that homeostasis and stability in ecosystems was a result of evolutionary processes, and [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]] (his brother) extended this work to include thermodynamic effects in producing ecological &amp;quot;steady states&amp;quot;.  Howard Odum also extended the nature of the scale of ecosystems from that of a single pond upwards, showing that a &amp;quot;nested hierarchy&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;[[heterarchy]]&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;[[holarchy]]&amp;quot; existed in which systems could be considered as elements of larger systems (leaf to tree to glade to forest to [[bioregion]] to biotic [[realm]] or [[biomes]]). On the basis of this, Gaia theory and geophysiology represent the ultimate extension of these principles.
