        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;George Dance the Elder&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1695&amp;amp;nbsp;– 8 February 1768) was an English architect of the 18th century.  He was the [[City of London]] [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]] and architect from 1735 until his death.

==Life==
Originally a mason, George Dance was appointed Clerk of the City works to the [[City of London]]. In 1734, shortly before taking up the post, he had won a major commission from the City, for the [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]], the new residence for the [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor]].  He was one of three architects—the others being [[James Gibbs]] and [[Giacomo Leoni]]—who had been invited to submit designs. His building has a grand portico, and an &amp;quot;Egyptian Hall&amp;quot;, so called because it uses an arrangement of columns described as Egyptian by [[Vitruvius]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Summerson 1962, pp.62–3&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was completed in 1752.

He also designed the churches of [[St Leonard&amp;apos;s, Shoreditch]] (1736–1740),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Summerson 1962, p.305&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[St Botolph&amp;apos;s Aldgate]] (1741–44)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Summerson 1962, p.297&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and St Matthew&amp;apos;s, Bethnal Green (1743–6).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Summerson 1962, p.305&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Further afield, Dance designed the Town Hall of [[Coleraine]] in Northern Ireland (1743; demolished in 1859).

Sir John Summerson included Dance in a list of London architects who he felt debased Palladianism, calling his Mansion House &amp;quot;cramped and overdressed&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Summerson 1970, p.366&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He had five sons, three of whom enjoyed fame in their own right. Eldest son [[James Dance (actor)|James Dance]] (1722–1744) became an [[actor]] and [[playwright]] connected with [[Drury Lane]] theatre. Third son [[Nathaniel Dance-Holland]] (1735–1811) was a notable painter. Fifth son [[George Dance the Younger]] (1741–1825) succeeded him as city architect. His grandson by James Dance was [[Nathaniel Dance]], commodore of the fleets of the [[East India Company]], and victor of the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]].

Dance is buried in the churchyard of [[St Luke Old Street|St Luke&amp;apos;s Old Street]], north of the City of London.
