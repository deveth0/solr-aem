{{Other people2|George Munro (disambiguation)}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;George Munro&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (November 12, 1825 &amp;amp;ndash; 23 April 1896) was a [[Canadian]] educator and philanthropist from [[Nova Scotia]]. He was born in [[West River, Nova Scotia|West River]], [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia|Pictou County]], [[Nova Scotia]]. After basic schooling he became an apprentice at the age of 12 with a local newspaper known as The Observer. After two years he continued his education attending the [[New Glasgow School]] (1839 - 1842). After this he taught for a year to raise enough money to attend [[Pictou Academy]].

Around 1850, Munro moved to [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] and taught [[natural philosophy]] and [[mathematics]] at the [[Free Church Academy]]. He eventually became the school&amp;apos;s principal before leaving for [[New York City]] in 1856. Five years later in 1861, he joined the publishing firm [[Irwin P. Beadle and Company]]. In 1863 the firm broke up and Munro entered in a partnership with [[Irwin Beadle|Beadle]] and ended up owning the company a year later.

Munro became rich from his publishing company and in 1879 began donating to [[Dalhousie University]] under the influence of his brother-in-law, a member of the university&amp;apos;s Board of Governors. At the time Dalhousie&amp;apos;s total income was only $6,600, and the university was in danger of shutting down. In all Munro gave approximately $333,000 to the university (about $8 million in today&amp;apos;s funds) which included endowed professorships and bursaries.

To commemorate his generosity, a university [[holiday]], [[Munro Day]], is celebrated each year on the first Friday of February.
