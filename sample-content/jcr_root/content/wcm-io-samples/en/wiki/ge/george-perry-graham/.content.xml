&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;George Perry Graham&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Queen&amp;apos;s Privy Council for Canada|PC]] (31 March 1859 &amp;amp;ndash; 1 January 1943) was a journalist, editor and politician in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].

In the [[Ontario general election, 1898|1898 Ontario provincial election]], he was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]], and re-elected in 1902 and 1905. In 1904, he was appointed to the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] as [[Provincial Secretary]] by [[Premier]] [[George William Ross]] and served in that position until the Ross government lost the [[Ontario general election, 1905|election of 1905]].

When Ross resigned as leader of the [[Ontario Liberal Party]] in 1907, Graham briefly succeeded him, but quickly left later that year for federal politics when he was appointed Minister of Railway and Canals in the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government of Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]].

Ross won a seat in the [[Canadian House of Commons]] in a [[by-election]] in 1907. He was defeated in the [[Canadian federal election, 1911|1911 federal election]] that brought [[Robert Borden]]&amp;apos;s [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]] to power, but returned to the House of Commons in a 1912 by-election.

In 1921, he served in a number of defence portfolios in the Cabinet of [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]. He lost his seat in the [[Canadian federal election, 1925|1925 federal election]], but was appointed to the [[Canadian Senate]] in 1926, and sat in that body until his death in 1943.
