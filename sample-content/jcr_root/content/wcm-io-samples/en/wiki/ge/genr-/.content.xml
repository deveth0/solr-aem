{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Genrō&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|元老}} was an unofficial designation given to certain retired elder [[Japan]]ese [[politician|statesmen]], considered the &amp;quot;founding fathers&amp;quot; of modern Japan,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} who served as informal extraconstitutional advisors to the emperor, during the [[Meiji period|Meiji]], [[Taishō period|Taishō]] and early [[Shōwa period|Shōwa]] periods in [[History of Japan|Japanese history]].

The institution of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;genrō&amp;apos;&amp;apos; originated with the traditional council of elders (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Rōjū]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) common in the [[Edo period]]; however, the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;genrō&amp;apos;&amp;apos; appears to have been coined by a newspaper only in 1892. The term is sometimes confused with the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Genrōin]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Chamber of Elders), a [[Legislature|legislative body]] which existed from 1875–1890; however, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;genrō&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were not related to the establishment of that body or its dissolution.

Experienced leaders of the [[Meiji Restoration]] were singled out by the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;genkun&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and asked to act as Imperial advisors. With the exception of Saionji Kinmochi, all the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;genrō&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were from medium or lower ranking &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[samurai]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; families, four each from [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and [[Chōshū Domain|Chōshū]], the two former domains that had been instrumental in the overthrow of the former [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in the [[Boshin War]] of the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1867-1868. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;genrō&amp;apos;&amp;apos; had the right to select and nominate [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Ministers]] to the Emperor for approval.

The first seven genrō were all formerly members of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sangi]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Imperial Council) which was abolished in 1885. They are also sometimes known to historians as the [[Meiji oligarchy]], although not all of the Meiji oligarchs were &amp;apos;&amp;apos;genrō&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The institution expired in 1940, with the death of the last of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;genrō&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Saionji Kinmochi.
