        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;German Forum Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-de|Deutsche Forumpartei}}) was an opposition [[political party]] in [[East Germany]]. It was formed from the [[New Forum]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Neues Forum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) citizens&amp;apos; movement. It was founded in [[Chemnitz|Karl-Marx-Stadt]] (now Chemnitz) on 27 January 1990. Its first chairman was JÃ¼rgen Schmieder. It described itself as being at the political centre.

It was invited to join the Christian Democrat dominated [[Alliance for Germany]] coalition for the 1990 [[Volkskammer]] election but instead it joined the [[Association of Free Democrats]] in 12 February 1990.
