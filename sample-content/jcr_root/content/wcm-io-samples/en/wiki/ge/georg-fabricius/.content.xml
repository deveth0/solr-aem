&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Georg Fabricius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (23 April 1516 – 17 July 1571), born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Georg Goldschmidt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Germany|German]] [[poet]], [[historian]] and [[archaeologist]].

== Life ==

Fabricius was born in [[Chemnitz]] in [[Saxony]] and educated at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]]. Travelling in [[Italy]] with one of his pupils, he made an exhaustive study of the antiquities of [[Rome]]. He published the results in his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Roma&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1550), in which the correspondence between every discoverable relic of the old city and the references to them in ancient literature was traced in detail. In 1546 he was appointed rector of [[Federal School of Saxony - Saint Afra|Saint Afra]] in [[Meissen]].

In 1549 Fabricius edited the first short selection of Roman inscriptions specifically focusing on legal texts. This was a key moment in the history of classical [[epigraphy]]: for the first time in print a humanist explicitly demonstrated the value of such archaeological remains for the discipline of law, and implicitly accorded texts inscribed in stone as authoritative status as those recorded in manuscripts.

In his sacred poems he affected to avoid every word with the slightest savour of paganism; and he blamed the poets for their allusions to pagan divinities.

Fabricius died at [[Meissen]].

== Works ==

Principal works:

*editions of [[Terence]] (1548), [[Virgil]] (1551) and [[Horace]] (1555, apud H. Petrum)

A life of Georg Fabricius was published in 1839 by [[D. C. W. Baumgarten-Crusius]], who in 1845 also issued an edition of Fabricius&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Epistolae ad W Meurerum et alios aequales&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, with a short sketch &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Vita Ge. Fabricius de gente Fabriciorum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; see also [[F. Wachter]] in [[Ersch]] and [[Gruber]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Allgemeine Encyclopädie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
