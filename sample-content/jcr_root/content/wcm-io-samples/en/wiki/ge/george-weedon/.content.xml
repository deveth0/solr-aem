&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;George Weedon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1734â€“1793) was an American soldier during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] from [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]. He served as a Brigadier General in the [[Continental Army]] and later in the [[Virginia]] militia.

Weedon served as a Lieutenant under [[George Washington]] in the [[French and Indian War]], mainly assigned to garrison duty in western Virginia.

After the war, he moved to Fredericksburg and opened a tavern.  It was within Weedon&amp;apos;s tavern that [[Thomas Jefferson]] in January 1777 wrote the [[Statute of Religious Freedom]]; the very first document of its kind to acknowledge government recognition of religious tolerance.

In 1775, he was made a Lieutenant Colonel and second in command to [[Hugh Mercer]].  They were tasked with creating the [[3rd Virginia Regiment]], [[Virginia Line]], [[Continental Army]]. He was promoted to colonel in 1776 and succeeded Mercer in command of his regiment.  On Mercer&amp;apos;s death at Princeton, Weedon was promoted to Brigadier General in 1777 and again succeeded him. He fought in the Battles of [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]], [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]], and [[Battle of Germantown|Germantown]].

At [[Valley Forge]], Weedon commanded a brigade in [[Nathanael Greene]]&amp;apos;s division. His brigade included Stewart&amp;apos;s [[13th Pennsylvania Regiment]] along with the [[2nd Virginia Regiment|2nd]], [[6th Virginia Regiment|6th]], [[10th Virginia Regiment|10th]], and [[14th Virginia Regiment|14th]] Virginia regiments.

In 1778, he resigned after a dispute with the [[Continental Congress|Congress]] over seniority.  He went home to Virginia to lead a brigade of the state&amp;apos;s militia at the request of Governor [[Thomas Jefferson]].  He led his militia unit in the [[siege of Yorktown|Yorktown campaign]], where his brigade successfully repelled the feared and infamous unit of Colonel [[Banastre Tarleton]], thus closing the one means of British escape at [[Gloucester Point]].
