The [[Faroe Islands]] are an island group consisting of eighteen islands off the coast of Northern Europe, between the [[Norwegian Sea]] and the [[North Atlantic]], about half-way between [[Iceland]] and [[Norway]]. Its coordinates are {{coord|62|N|7|W|}}. It is 1,393 square kilometres in area, and includes no major lakes or rivers. There are 1,117 kilometres of coastline, and no land boundaries with any other country.

The Faroe Islands generally have cool summers and mild winters, with a usually overcast sky and frequent fog and strong winds. Although at a high latitude, due to the [[Gulf Stream]], their climate is ameliorated. The islands are rugged and rocky with some low peaks; the coasts are mostly bordered by cliffs. The Faroe Islands are notable for having the highest sea cliffs in Europe, and some of the highest in the world otherwise. The lowest point is at sea level, and the highest is at [[Slættaratindur]], which is 882 metres above sea level. The landscape made roadbuilding difficult, and only recently has this been remedied by building tunnels.

Many of the Faroese islands tend to be elongated in shape.

[[Natural resource]]s include [[Fishing|fish]] and [[hydropower]].
