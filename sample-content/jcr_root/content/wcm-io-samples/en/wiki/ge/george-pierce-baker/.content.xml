&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;George Pierce Baker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 4, 1866 – January 6, 1935)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;amp;GRid=33525823&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was an American educator in the field of [[drama]].

Baker graduated in the [[Harvard University]] class of 1887, and taught in the English Department at Harvard from 1888 until 1924. He started his &amp;quot;47 workshop&amp;quot; class in playwriting in 1905. He was instrumental in creating the Harvard Theatre Collection at [[Harvard University Library]]. In 1908 he began the Harvard Dramatic Club, acting as its sponsor, and in 1912 he founded Workshop 47 to provide a forum for the performance of plays developed within his English 47 class. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1914.&amp;lt;ref name=AAAS&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Unable to persuade Harvard to offer a degree in playwriting, he moved to [[Yale University]] in 1925, where he helped found the [[Yale School of Drama]]. He remained there until his retirement in 1933.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;cgt&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Banham|editor-first = Martin|year=1998|chapter=Baker, George Pierce|title=The Cambridge Guide to Theatre|location=Cambridge|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-43437-8|pages=72–73}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Baker was also selected to teach a seminar whose unconfirmed title was &amp;quot;Shakespeare&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the English drama&amp;quot; at the [[Sorbonne]] University (Paris, France) in 1908.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Archival source: CARAN, Paris. AJ/16-4750 (1907) p. 67&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Among those he taught in his playwriting class were [[George Abbott]], [[Philip Barry]], [[S.N. Behrman]], [[Hallie Flanagan]], [[Sidney Howard]], [[Stanley McCandless]], [[Eugene O&amp;apos;Neill]], [[Edward Sheldon]], [[Maurine Dallas Watkins]], and [[Thomas Wolfe]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;cgt&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dramatic Technique&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1919) offered a codification in English of the principles of the [[well-made play]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book
