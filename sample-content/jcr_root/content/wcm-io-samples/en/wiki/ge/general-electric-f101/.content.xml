The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;General Electric F101&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[Afterburner|afterburning]] [[turbofan]] [[jet engine]]. It powers the [[B-1 Lancer]] strategic bomber fleet of the [[USAF]]. In full afterburner it produces a thrust of {{convert|30000|lb-f|kN|lk=on}}.  The F101 was [[GE Aviation|GE]]&amp;apos;s first turbofan with an afterburner.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.geae.com/engines/military/f101/index.html GE&amp;apos;s F101 web page]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Development==
The F101 was developed specifically for the Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft, which became the B-1A. The F101 powered the four development aircraft from 1970 to 1981. The B-1A was officially cancelled in 1977.  However the flight test program continued.  [[General Electric]] was awarded a contract to further develop the F101-102 engine variant. This turbofan eventually powered the B-1B from 1984, entering service in 1986.  The B-1&amp;apos;s four F101 engines helped the aircraft win 61 world records for speed, payload and range.

The [[General Electric F110|GE F110]] fighter engine is a derivative of the F101, designed using data from the F101-powered variant of the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] tested in the early 1980s.  The F101 also became the basis for the highly successful [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56]] series of civil turbofans.
