&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gerald Edward Bermingham&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[United Kingdom|British]] politician, and was [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[St Helens South (UK Parliament constituency)|St Helens South]] from 1983 until 2001.&amp;lt;ref name=stich&amp;gt;{{cite web| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1327000/1327507.stm | title = Safe seat &amp;apos;stitch-up&amp;apos; | accessdate = 2010-12-05 | date = 2001-05-13 | publisher = &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[BBC News Online]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He was born 20 August 1940 in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], and educated at Cotton College, Wellingborough Grammar School and [[Sheffield University]], where he obtained a degree in law.  He was admitted as a solicitor in 1967, and was called to the Bar ([[Gray&amp;apos;s Inn]]) in 1985. He was a [[Sheffield]] City councillor from 1975 to 1979. He contested South East Derbyshire in 1979.

In 1994, he was one of six Labour MPs who voted against any reduction in the age of consent for homosexuals, even to 18 (at the time, the age of consent was 21).&amp;lt;ref name=opposed&amp;gt;{{cite news | first = David | last = Mckie | title = Four in 10 Conservatives opposed change | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | date = 1994-02-23 | accessdate = 2010-12-05}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On his retirement, he was succeeded by [[Shaun Woodward]], a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] defector, who swapped his old seat of [[Witney (UK Parliament constituency)|Witney]] to represent the ultra-safe St Helens South.&amp;lt;ref name=labour&amp;gt;{{cite web| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1329000/1329410.stm | title = &amp;apos;I&amp;apos;m Labour man now&amp;apos; - Woodward | accessdate = 2010-12-05 | date = 2001-05-14 | publisher = &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[BBC News Online]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
