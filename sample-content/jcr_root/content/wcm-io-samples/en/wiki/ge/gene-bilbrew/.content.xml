&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eugene &amp;quot;Gene&amp;quot; Bilbrew&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (June 29, 1923 – May 1974)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Social Security Death Index, SS# 565-24-5141.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was an American [[cartoonist]] and [[fetish artist]]. In addition to signing his work with his own name, he drew under a range of pseudonyms, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ENEG&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Gene&amp;quot; spelled backwards), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Van Rod&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bondy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

He began his career at the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Los Angeles Sentinel]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, an [[African American|African-American]] newspaper, where he illustrated the [[comic strip]] series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Bronze Bomber&amp;apos;&amp;apos;—coauthored by Bill Alexander. He also wrote the series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hercules&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Health Magazine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Throughout his life, he took freelance assignments within the African American community, for instance producing modernized cover art for Victorian-era [[lottery]] numbers books such as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gypsy Witch Dream Book&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Old Aunt Dinah&amp;apos;s Dream Book&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for the Wholesale Sales Corp.

Around 1950 Bilbrew became an assistant to the hugely influential [[comics artist]] [[Will Eisner]], on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Spirit]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.wristrope.com/eneg_bio.htm Bilbrew bio at WristRope.com.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; where Bilbrew took over the back-up series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Clifford&amp;apos;&amp;apos;—a little-kid humour page—after its originator [[Jules Feiffer]] was drafted into the army.

Bilbrew&amp;apos;s later notability came when he became a fetish artist at [[Irving Klaw]]&amp;apos;s Movie Star News/Nutrix company. He also had many illustrations published in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Exotique (fetish magazine)|Exotique]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; magazine between 1956 and 1959.
