The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gendarmenmarkt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a square in [[Berlin]], and the site of the [[Konzerthaus Berlin|Konzerthaus]] and the [[French Cathedral|French]] and [[German Cathedral]]s. In the centre of the square is a statue of Germany&amp;apos;s poet [[Friedrich Schiller]]. The square was created by [[Johann Arnold Nering]] at the end of the seventeenth century as the Linden-Markt and reconstructed by [[Georg Christian Unger]] in 1773. The Gendarmenmarkt is named after the [[cuirassier]] regiment Gens d&amp;apos;Armes, which was deployed at this square until 1773.

During [[World War II]], most of the buildings were badly damaged or destroyed. Today all the buildings have been restored to their former state.

== Französischer Dom ==
The [[French Cathedral]] (in German: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Französischer Dom&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) the older of the two cathedrals, was built by the [[Huguenot]] community between 1701 and 1705. The cathedral was modelled after the destroyed Huguenot church in [[Saint-Maurice, Val-de-Marne|Charenton-Saint-Maurice]], France. The tower and [[portico]]es, designed by [[Carl von Gontard]], were added to the building in 1785. The French cathedral has a viewing platform, a restaurant and a Huguenot museum.

== Deutscher Dom ==
The [[German Cathedral]] (in German: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Deutscher Dom&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is located in the south of the Gendarmenmarkt. It has a [[pentagonal]] structure and was designed by [[Martin Grünberg]] and built in 1708 by [[Giovanni Simonetti]]. It too was modified in 1785 by Carl von Gontard, who built the domed tower. The German Cathedral was completely destroyed by fire in 1945, during [[World War II]]. After [[German reunification]] it was rebuilt, finished in 1993 and re-opened in 1996 as a museum of German history.

== Konzerthaus ==
The [[Konzerthaus Berlin]] is the most recent building on the Gendarmenmarkt. It was built by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] in 1821 as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Schauspielhaus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It was based on the ruins of the National Theatre, which was destroyed by fire in 1817. Parts of the building contain columns and some outside walls from the destroyed building. Like the other buildings on the square, it was also badly damaged during World War II. The reconstruction, finished in 1984, turned the theatre into a concert hall. Today, it is the home of the [[Konzerthausorchester Berlin]].

The Gendarmenmarkt hosts one of Berlin&amp;apos;s most popular [[Christmas market]]s.
