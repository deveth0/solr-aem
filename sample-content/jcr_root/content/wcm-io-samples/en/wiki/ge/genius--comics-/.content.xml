        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Genius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[newspaper]] [[cartoon]] series by Scottish ([[Glasgow|Glaswegian]]) artist [[John Glashan]] that appeared in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Observer]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; newspaper in the United Kingdom from 1978 to 1983.

The chief characters were Anode Enzyme and Lord Doberman.  Their adventures were mostly surreal and the humour relied heavily upon Glashan&amp;apos;s imaginative [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]] artwork.

==Anode Enzyme==
Anode Enzyme was the chief protagonist (along with Lord Doberman) of &amp;quot;Genius&amp;quot;.
With an IQ of 12790 (was 12794-but lost four points watching TV) and only requiring seven minutes of sleep a day, Anode Enzyme is characterised by his genius.  He meets Lord Doberman, the world&amp;apos;s richest man, and devises ways of getting rid of his wealth by inventing a machine that fires 40 TV sets into the sea every minute and a device that can stack Â£300,000,000 into a continuous pile.
Other inventions include a paint that incorporates its own paint stripper, a &amp;quot;Doom Module&amp;quot; that runs in terror from anything that moves, and a game that involves striking a solid melamine sphere, coach bolted to a billiard table with a 3lb vanadium steel, leather faced hammer - one point for each hit.
