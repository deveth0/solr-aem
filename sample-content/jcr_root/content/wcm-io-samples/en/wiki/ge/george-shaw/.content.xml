&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;George Shaw&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (10 December 1751 – 22 July 1813) was an [[England|English]] [[botanist]] and [[zoologist]].

==Life==
Shaw was born at [[Bierton]], [[Buckinghamshire]] and was educated at [[Magdalen Hall, Oxford]], receiving his M.A. in 1772. He took up the profession of medical practitioner. In 1786 he became the assistant lecturer in botany at [[Oxford University]]. He was a co-founder of the [[Linnean Society]] in 1788, and  became a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1789.

In 1791 Shaw became assistant keeper of the natural history department at the [[British Museum]], succeeding [[Edward Whitaker Gray]] as keeper in 1806. He found that most of the items donated to the museum by [[Hans Sloane]] were in very bad condition. Medical and anatomical material was sent to the museum at the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]], but many of the stuffed animals and birds had deteriorated and had to be burnt.  He was succeeded after his death by his assistant [[Charles Konig]].

==Works==
Shaw published one of the first English descriptions with scientific names of several Australian animals in his &amp;quot;Zoology of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]&amp;quot; (1794). He was among the first scientists to examine a [[platypus]] and published the first scientific description of it in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Naturalist&amp;apos;s Miscellany&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1799.

In the field of [[herpetology]] he described numerous new species of [[reptiles]] and [[amphibians]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

His other publications included:
