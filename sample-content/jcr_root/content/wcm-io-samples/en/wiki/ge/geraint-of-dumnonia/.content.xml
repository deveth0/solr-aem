&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Geraint&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (known in [[Latin]] as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gerontius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (died 710) was a King of [[Dumnonia]] who ruled in the early 8th century. During his reign, it is believed that Dumnonia came repeatedly into conflict with neighbouring [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Wessex]]. Geraint was the last recorded king of a unified Dumnonia, and was called [[King of Wales|King of the Welsh]] by the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Subsequent kings of Dumnonia (for example [[Donyarth]] and possibly [[Huwal of the West Welsh|Huwal]]) reigned over a reducing area that eventually encompassed only the present day [[Cornwall]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Philip Payton]]. (1996). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cornwall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Fowey: Alexander Associates&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

A long and rather acrimonious letter survives addressed to him from [[Aldhelm, Bishop of Sherborne|Aldhelm]], [[Bishop of Sherborne (historic)|Bishop of Sherborne]] on the [[Easter Problem]] and the shape of the tonsure. It is clear from this letter that in the later 7th century the [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] in Cornwall and [[Devon]] still observed [[Easter]] on the dates that the [[Celtic Christianity|British]] church had calculated, at variance with [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman]] practice. Geraint ultimately agreed with Aldhelm to comply with Roman practice on these points. According to [[John of Worcester]], Geraint was killed after a series of battles that culminated in a victory of the West Saxons under [[Ine of Wessex]] in 710. It was probably around this time that Devon was conquered by the West Saxons. After Geraint&amp;apos;s death, however, Ine was unable to establish his authority over neighbouring Cornwall; in 722, according to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Annales Cambriae]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the Cornish won the [[Battle of Hehil]], probably against Wessex.

Derek Bryce, following other scholars, suggests Geraint of Dumnonia be identified as the warrior eulogized in the poem &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Battle of Llongborth]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, traditionally ascribed to [[Llywarch Hen]]. Other scholars associate the slain man with [[Geraint|Geraint ab Erbin]], a king said to have lived during the 5th century but of dubious historicity. Bryce identifies Llongborth with the 710 battle between Geraint and Ine, and suggests [[Langport]] in [[Somerset]] as the location of the battle.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.templum.freeserve.co.uk/history/strathclyde/awp/geraint.htm History of Drumchapel: Geraint, Son of Erbin]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
