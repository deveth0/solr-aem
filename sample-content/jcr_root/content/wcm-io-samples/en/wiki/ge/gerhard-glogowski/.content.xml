{{bquote|There is no difference between [[National Democratic Party of Germany|NPD]], [[German People&amp;apos;s Union|DVU]] and [[The Republicans (Germany)|Republicans]] (German REP). To me they are all part of the right-wing radical swamp. That means it&amp;apos;s like sorting shit by smell. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Manfred Funke: [http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_569-544-1-30.pdf &amp;apos;&amp;apos;„Antifaschismus“ – Zum Blendcharakter einer politischen Allzweckwaffe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;] (PDF-Datei; 112 KB)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;}}
