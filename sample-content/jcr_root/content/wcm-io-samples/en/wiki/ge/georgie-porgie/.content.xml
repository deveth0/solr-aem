&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;Georgie Porgie&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a popular [[English language]] [[nursery rhyme]]. It has a [[Roud Folk Song Index]] number of 19532.

==Lyrics==
The most common modern lyrics are:
:Georgie Porgie, Puddin&amp;apos; and Pie,
:Kissed the girls and made them cry,
:When the boys came out to play
:Georgie Porgie ran away.&amp;lt;ref name=Opie1997&amp;gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 185-6.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Origins and meaning==
The first recorded version of the rhyme was collected by [[James Orchard Halliwell]] in the mid-19th century with the lyrics:

:Rowley Powley, pumpkin pie,
:Kissed the girls and made them cry;
:When the girls began to cry,
:Rowly Powley runs away.&amp;lt;ref name=Opie1997/&amp;gt;

However, the version with Georgie Porgie was known to [[George Bernard Shaw]] (1856-1950) in his childhood and so may be at least as old.

There are various theories that link the character Georgie Porgie to historical figures including [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] (1592-1628), [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (1630-1685) and [[George I of England|George I]] (1660-1727), but there is no evidence to corroborate such claims.&amp;lt;ref name=Opie1997/&amp;gt;

==Cultural references==

The song was written by Toto keyboard player [[David Paich]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.post-lyrics.com/5-TOTO-PAST_TO_PRESENT_HITS.html].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
The first line is sang by Supercat near the end of [[Sugar Ray]]&amp;apos;s song &amp;apos;Fly&amp;apos;. A reference to the rhyme is made in [[Aldous Huxley]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;[[Brave New World]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1932), Chapter five:
:Orgy-porgy, Ford and fun,
:Kiss the girls and make them One.
:Boys at one with girls at peace;
:Orgy-porgy gives release.
