&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;George Randolph Hearst, Sr.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 23, 1904 &amp;amp;ndash; January 26, 1972) was the eldest son of [[William Randolph Hearst]].

Though he never held a title higher than Vice-President at the [[Hearst Corporation]], he was listed above many with higher-sounding titles when executives were listed in the company&amp;apos;s publications. One of the five family trustees of the trust established under his father&amp;apos;s will (which made sure that eight non-family trustees would have majority control), he was able to secure a seat on the corporation&amp;apos;s board for his son, [[George Randolph Hearst, Jr.]], in the 1950s. After Hearst Sr.&amp;apos;s death in 1972, his son succeeded him as a trustee and was chairman of the corporation&amp;apos;s board from 1996 until his death in 2012.
