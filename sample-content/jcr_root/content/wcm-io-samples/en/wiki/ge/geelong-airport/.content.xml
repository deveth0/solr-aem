&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Geelong Airport&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;lt;s&amp;gt;{{airport codes|GEX|YGLG}}&amp;lt;/s&amp;gt; was a small airfield specifically for light aircraft located in [[Mount Duneed, Victoria|Mount Duneed]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia. It was primarily used for scenic flights and private aircraft, and was located in the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of the [[City of Greater Geelong]].

The airport remained small and undeveloped and contained two gravel/tarmac [[runway]]s: north/south and east/west. Though commercial airlines had attempted to fly services to Geelong in the past, they chose to use the more developed airport at [[Avalon Airport]], located to the north on the [[Melbourne]] side of the city. Other airports in the area are at [[Barwon Heads Airport|Barwon Heads]] {{airport codes||YBRS}} and the [[Torquay Airport]] {{airport codes||YTQY}} in Blackgate Road, Torquay.

The site is also used to record wind and weather measurements for the area.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_087163.shtml Bureau of Meteorology: Summary statistics GEELONG AIRPORT]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Geelong airport was sold to property developers to allow for the expansion of the [[urban sprawl]] of Geelong. The airport closed 31 December 2011.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.geelongcity.vic.gov.au/Services_In_Geelong/Planning/Strategic_Planning/Armstrong_Creek_Urban_Growth_Plan/ City of Greater Geelong: Armstrong Creek Urban Growth Plan]{{Dead link|date=July 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
