&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;George Douglas Brown&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (26 January 1869 â€“ 28 August 1902) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scottish novelists|novelist]], best known for his highly influential [[literary realism|realist]] novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The House with the Green Shutters]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1901), which was published the year before his death at the age of 33.

==Life and work==
Brown was the illegitimate son of a farmer and a woman of Irish descent. He went to school at [[Ochiltree]], [[Coylton]], and [[Ayr]], his academic performance allowing him to study Classics at the [[University of Glasgow]] and at [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. However his studies were interrupted by the illness of his mother; he returned to [[Ayrshire]] to nurse her, but she died, and in 1895 he barely passed his final examinations. He travelled to [[London]] and worked as a journalist, contributing articles and stories to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Blackwood&amp;apos;s Magazine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as well as a part-time editor and reader for publishing houses. At one point he was a staff writer for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sandow&amp;apos;s Magazine of Physical Culture]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Patrick Scott, &amp;apos;Body-Building and Empire-Building: George Douglas Brown, The South African War, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sandow&amp;apos;s Magazine of Physical Culture&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Victorian Periodicals Review&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 41:1 (2008), pp. 78-94&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 1899 he published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Love and a Sword&amp;apos;&amp;apos; under the [[pseudonym]] Kennedy King, the same pseudonym he used for his articles. The next year he started work at [[Haslemere]] on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The House with the Green Shutters&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was published in 1901 under the pseudonym George Douglas. The book was a success, and he planned a second novel to be called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Incompatibles&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but shortly afterwards he contracted [[pneumonia]] and died at the home of his friend and publisher [[Andrew Melrose]].

The novel gives a strongly outlined picture of the harder and less genial aspects of Scottish life and character, and was regarded as a useful corrective to the more roseate presentations of the [[kailyard school]] of [[J. M. Barrie]] and [[Ian Maclaren]]. Reprinted frequently throughout the twentieth century, it was most recently re-issued by [[Birlinn]] of [[Edinburgh]]. An annual event in Brown&amp;apos;s memory, The Green Shutters Festival of Working Class Writing, is held in [[Ochiltree]], the town believed to be the model for the village of Barbie.

In December 2004, the house in which he was born was gutted by fire.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Martyn McLaughlin. &amp;quot;Reopening the House with the Green Shutters.&amp;quot; The Herald, 30 January 2006, page 26.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

As of August 2007, the house in which he was born in Ochiltree has been re-opened as &amp;quot;The Green Shutters Pub&amp;quot;. A memorial plaque is allocated on the outside wall.
