        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gennady Kolbin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Russian language|Russian]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Геннадий Колбин&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; 1927-1998) was the First Secretary of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party]] of [[Kazakh SSR]] from December 16, 1986 to June 22, 1989.

Kolbin had not worked in the Kazakh SSR prior to his appointment. He was appointed by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in an attempt to root out corruption in the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR.

As an outsider to Kazakhstan, he was not well received there. His appointment resulted in violent protests in the Kazakh capital [[Almaty]] and other cities, with several protesters killed and hundreds injured. This revolt is now known as &amp;quot;[[Jeltoqsan]]&amp;quot;, the [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] for &amp;quot;December&amp;quot;. It is reported that the outgoing first secretary, [[Dinmukhamed Kunayev]], participated in organizing the protests, which involved 60,000 protesters&amp;amp;nbsp;[http://www.eurasianet.org/resource/kazakhstan/hypermail/200204/0053.shtml].

In June 1989, Kolbin was replaced by Kazakh [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]]. Kolbin was then transferred to a position in [[Moscow]].
