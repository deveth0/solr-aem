The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dusky Thrush&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Turdus eunomus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a member of the [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]] family Turdidae which breeds eastwards from central [[Siberia]]. It is closely related to the more southerly breeding [[Naumann&amp;apos;s Thrush]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;T. naumanni&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; the two have often been regarded as [[conspecific]].

This species breeds in open woodland areas, but unlike Naumann&amp;apos;s Thrush, Dusky Thrush is more tolerant of mountainous and tundra-edge habitats. This species is strongly [[bird migration|migratory]], wintering south to southeast [[Asia]], principally in [[China]] and neighbouring countries. It is a rare vagrant to western [[Europe]].

It nests in trees, laying 3-5 [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s in an untidy but neatly lined nest. Migrating birds and wintering birds often form small flocks. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of [[insects]], especially [[mosquito]]es,  [[earthworm]]s and berries.

This is a medium-sized but stocky thrush, reminiscent in structure of a small [[Fieldfare]]. The underwing is reddish brown, and there is a pale [[wikt:Supercilium|supercilium]].

Dusky Thrush has a dark brown back and rump; the face, breast, and flank spots rump are black and the belly and undertail are white. Naumann&amp;apos;s Thrush in comparison has a paler brown back and head; the face, breast, flank spots and rump are reddish, and the belly and undertail are white.

The female is fairly similar to the male, but immatures have a weaker patterning.

The male Dusky Thrush has a simple fluted or whistling song, similar to the [[Redwing]]. There are suggestions that the songs of Dusky and Naumann&amp;apos;s Thrush differ.
