&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Duamutef&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was one of the [[Four Sons of Horus]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/religion/sons_of_horus.htm The four Sons of Horus, Duamutef also Tuamutef]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and a protection
god of the [[Canopic jar]]s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptianmyths.net/duamutef.htm |title=Duamutef(Tuamutef, Golden Dawn, Thmoomathph) |publisher=Egyptianmyths.net |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Commonly he is said to be the son of the god &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Horus the Elder&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
(Heru-ur) and the goddess [[Isis]]. There is another myth that describes
Duamutef and his brothers as sons of Osiris. According to this myth they
were born from a lily flower that arose from the primaeval ocean.

The name Duamutef means &amp;quot;Who adores his mother&amp;quot;.

== Portrayal ==

First Duamutef was represented as a human wrapped in mummy bandages.
From the [[New Kingdom]] he is shown with the head of a [[jackal]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.egyptianmyths.net/duamutef.htm Duamutef (Tuamutef, Golden Dawn, Thmoomathph)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
In some cases his appearance is confused or exchanged with that of Qebehsenuef so
he has the head of a falcon and Qebehsenuef has the head of a jackal.

Duamutef usually was depicted on coffins and as the lid of
canopic jars. Many images of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Judgement of the Dead&amp;apos;&amp;apos; show him
together with his brothers in front of Osiris on a small lily flower.

== Meaning as Protection God of Canopic Jars ==

Together with the three other sons of Horus [[Imsety]], [[Hapi (Son of Horus)|Hapi]] and
[[Qebehsenuef]] he protected the [[mummified]] internal organs.
His duty was to protect the stomach.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://egyptologyscribbles.com/2012/01/21/list-of-egyptian-deities-d-f-gh/ Duamutef. (see: Four sons of Horus), Four sons of Horus.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; His protector is the goddess [[Neith]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www2.si.umich.edu/chico/mummy/Afterlife/Gods/Godstextx.html Duamutef: Alternate name[s]: Tuamutef; Golden Dawn, Thmoomathph]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
