The title of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Duke of Montagu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has been created several times.  It was first created in the [[Peerage of England]] in 1705 for [[Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu|Ralph Montagu, 3rd Baron Montagu of Boughton]], with the subsidiary title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marquess of Monthermer,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; but became extinct in 1749.  The first Duke had been created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earl of Montagu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscount Monthermer&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1689.  The Dukedom was then recreated in the [[Peerage of Great Britain]] in 1766 for the late Duke&amp;apos;s son-in-law, [[George Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu|George Montagu (né Brudenell), 4th Earl of Cardigan]], with the subsidiary title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marquess of Monthermer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  On his death in 1790 the dukedom and marquessate became extinct, and the earldom passed to his brother, [[James Brudenell, 5th Earl of Cardigan]]. The dukedom is named for the ancient [[Anglo-Norman]] family rather than any place.
