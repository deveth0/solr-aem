        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Duan Yucai&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|c=段玉裁}}) (1735–1815), [[courtesy name]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ruoying&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (若膺)  was a [[China|Chinese]] [[philology|philologist]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. He made great contributions to the study of [[Historical Chinese phonology]], and is known for his annotated edition of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Shuowen Jiezi]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Biography==
A native of [[Jintan]], [[Jiangsu]], he resigned his government post at the age of 46 to concentrate on his studies. A student of [[Dai Zhen]], he divided the [[syllable rime|rime]]s of [[Old Chinese]] into 17 groups. He suggested that &amp;quot;characters sharing the same [[Chinese character classification#Phono-semantic compound characters|phonetic component]] must belong to the same rime group [as deduced from the rhyming scheme of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Shijing]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]&amp;quot; (同聲必同部). He also suggested that there is no [[four tones|departing tone]] in Old Chinese.

His monumental &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shuowen Jiezi zhu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (說文解字注 &amp;quot;Annotated &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shuowen Jiezi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;), which he spent 30 years to complete, was published shortly before his death (in 1815). [[Wang Niansun]], in his preface to the work, says that &amp;quot;it has been 1,700 years since a work of the same quality appeared&amp;quot; (蓋千七百年來無此作矣), suggesting that it is the greatest Chinese philological work since &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shuowen Jiezi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was published during the early 2nd century.
