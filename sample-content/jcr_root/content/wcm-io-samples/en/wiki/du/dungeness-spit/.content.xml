&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dungeness Spit&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a {{convert|5.5|mi|km|sing=on}} long [[spit (landform)|sand spit]] jutting out from the northern edge of the [[Olympic Peninsula]] in northeastern [[Clallam County, Washington]], USA,  into the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]].   The body of water it encloses is called Dungeness Bay.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{GNIS|1519006|Dungeness Bay}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The Dungeness Spit is entirely within the [[Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge]] and home of the [[New Dungeness Light|Dungeness Lighthouse]]. It is the longest natural sand spit in the United States. Its land area, according to the [[United States Census Bureau]], is 1,271,454 square meters (0.4909 sq mi, or 314.18 [[acre]]s). The lighthouse once was run by United States Coast Guard, but since an automatic light was installed, it has been run by the &amp;quot;New Dungeness Lighthouse Organization&amp;quot;.  The spit is open to the public year around.

It was first found by Europeans during the Spanish [[Juan Carrasco (explorer)#1790 voyage under Quimper|1790 Quimper expedition]].  The name &amp;quot;Dungeness&amp;quot; comes from the [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness headland]] in [[England]].  The spit was named by explorer [[George Vancouver]] in 1792, who wrote: &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The low sandy point of land, which from its great resemblance to Dungeness in the British Channel, I called New Dungeness.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |last= Phillips |first= James W. |title= Washington State Place Names |year= 1971 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 0-295-95158-3}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In December 2001 a heavy winter storm forced water over the spit. The next morning the spit was broken in three places, and vehicles supplying the lighthouse were not able to traverse the spit for about a month.
