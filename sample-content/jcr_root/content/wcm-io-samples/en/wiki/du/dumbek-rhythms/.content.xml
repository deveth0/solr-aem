&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dumbek rhythms&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are a collection of rhythms that are usually played with hand drums such as the [[Goblet drum|dumbek]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;rhyfaq&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web

}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; These rhythms are various combinations of these three basic sounds:

*doum (D), produced with the dominant hand striking the sweet spot of the skin.
*tek (T), produced with the dominant hand striking the rim.
*ka (K), produced with the recessive hand striking the rim.

==Notation==

In a simple notation, these three sounds are represented by three letters: D, T, and K. When capitalized, the beat is emphasized, and when lower-case, it is played less emphatically.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;rhyfaq&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; These basic sounds can be combined with other sounds:

*suk or slap (S), produced with the dominant hand. Similar to the doum except the fingers are cupped to capture the air, making a loud terminating sound. The hand remains on the drum head to prevent sustain.
*trill (l), produced by lightly tapping three fingers of one hand in rapid succession on the rim
*roll, rushes (r), produced by a rapid alternating pattern of teks and kas

This is the simple dumbek rhythm notation for the 2/4 rhythm known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[ayyoub]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:

&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;
1-&amp;amp;-2-&amp;amp;-&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
D--kD-T-&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;

==Rhythms==
There are many traditional rhythms. Some are much more popular than others. The &amp;quot;big six&amp;quot; Middle Eastern rhythms are [[ayyoub]], [[beledi]], [[chiftitelli]], [[maqsoum]], [[masmoudi]] and [[saidi]].
