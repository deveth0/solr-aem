&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ga|Comhairle Buirge Dhún Geanainn agus Thír Eoghain Theas}}, [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rathgannon an Sooth Owenslann Burgh Cooncil&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.dungannon.gov.uk/index.cfm Dungannon &amp;amp; South Tyrone Borough Council]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; is a local council in [[Northern Ireland]]. Its main town is [[Dungannon]], where the council is headquartered. The council area covers the southern part of [[County Tyrone]] (along with a small area of [[County Armagh]]) and has a population of nearly 48,000. Apart from Dungannon there are many smaller towns including: [[Augher]], [[Clogher]], [[Fivemiletown]], [[Ballygawley, County Tyrone|Ballygawley]], [[Caledon, County Tyrone|Caledon]], [[Aughnacloy, County Tyrone|Aughnacloy]], [[Benburb]], [[Moy, Northern Ireland|Moy]] and [[Coalisland]].

The district was originally named Dungannon, and took its present name on November 25, 1999, after petitioning the [[Secretary of State for the Environment]].

The Dungannon and South Tyrone Council area consists of four electoral areas: Blackwater, Clogher Valley, Dungannon Town and Torrent. In the 2005 elections, 22 members were elected from the following political parties: 8 [[Sinn Féin]], 5 [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP), 4 [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) 4 [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) and 1 [[Éirígí]] (EIR). The Council adopted the [[d&amp;apos;Hondt method|d&amp;apos;Hondt]] system in 2001 which allows the position of Mayor and Deputy Mayor to be allocated according to party size. The current mayor is Councillor [[Michelle O&amp;apos;Neill]] (SF) and the Deputy Mayor is Councillor Norman Badger (UUP).

In elections for the [[Westminster Parliament]] it is split between the [[Mid Ulster (constituency)|Mid-Ulster]] and [[Fermanagh &amp;amp; South Tyrone (constituency)|Fermanagh &amp;amp; South Tyrone]] constituencies.

==Review of Public Administration==
Under the Review of Public Administration (RPA) the council is due to merge with [[Magherafelt District Council]] and [[Cookstown District Council]] in 2011 to form a single council for the enlarged area totalling 1714&amp;amp;nbsp;km² and a population of 120, 096.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | title=Minister Foster announces decisions on Local Government Reform | work=DoE | url=http://www.doeni.gov.uk/index/local_government/minister_foster_announces_decisions_on_local_government_reform.htm | accessdate=2008-05-31}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The next election was due to take place in May 2009, but on April 25, 2008, [[Shaun Woodward]], [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] announced that the scheduled 2009 district council elections were to be postponed until the introduction of the eleven new councils in 2011.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7367253.stm &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Northern Ireland elections are postponed&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, BBC News, April 25, 2008, accessed April 27, 2008]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
