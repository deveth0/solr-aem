        text="&lt;p&gt;[[Image:durantlogo.jpg|right|thumb|Durant marque logo]]The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Durant&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a make of [[automobile]] assembled by [[Durant Motors]] Corporation of [[New York City]], [[New York]] from 1921 to 1926 and again from 1928 to 1932.  Durant Motors was founded by [[William Crapo Durant|William &amp;quot;Billy&amp;quot; Durant]] after he was terminated as the head of [[General Motors]].  Billy Durant&amp;apos;s intent was to build an automotive empire that could one day challenge General Motors.

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Durant&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; automobile is considered to be an example of an &amp;quot;assembled&amp;quot; automobile because so many of its components were obtained from outside suppliers. From 1921 to 1926 the vehicle was powered by a [[Straight-4|four cylinder]] [[Continental engine]]. The vehicle was directed at the [[Oakland automobile]] price point.

Production of the vehicle was suspended for the 1926 and 1927 model years. When the Durant was reintroduced, the car was redesigned and powered by a [[Straight-6|six cylinder]] Continental engine; some of the early vehicles were marketed as the &amp;quot;Durant-Star&amp;quot;.  Bodies for the vehicle were supplied by [[Budd Company]]. In 1930, some Durants were built with all steel bodies, also supplied by Budd.

Durant Motors was found [[Insolvency|insolvent]] and automobile production ended early in 1932.
