{{Politics of Uganda}}
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Uganda Patriotic Movement&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a defunct [[political party]] in [[Uganda]]. It was founded by [[Yoweri Museveni]] and participated in the December 1980 [[Elections in Uganda|general elections]], which were won by [[Milton Obote]]&amp;apos;s [[Uganda People&amp;apos;s Congress]]. The election results were disputed, leading Museveni to form the [[National Resistance Movement]] and its military wing&amp;amp;mdash;the [[National Resistance Army]]&amp;amp;mdash;with which he waged a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla rebellion]] against Obote&amp;apos;s government. In 1986, Museveni became president.
