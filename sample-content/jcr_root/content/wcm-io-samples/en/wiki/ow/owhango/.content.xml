&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Owhango&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{coord|39|00.0|S|175|22.6|E|region:NZ_type:city(200)|display=title}} is a small town in [[New Zealand]] situated about 20&amp;amp;nbsp;km south of [[Taumarunui]] on State Highway 4 ([[New Zealand State Highway network#National|SH4]]).

Formerly &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Owhango&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a Mill Town, milling  native timbers from around the local area.  The mill burned to the ground in the [[Timeline of New Zealand history#1970s|1970s]]. Many of the mill houses are now holiday homes owned by city dwellers keen on the [[skiing]], [[fishing]], [[hunting]], [[canoeing]] and [[tramping]] opportunities that abound in the surrounding area. The village has a population of little more than 200 and has a primary school, a ski shop, dairy, garage (no fuel sold there, however), hotel, accommodation lodges, motel, cottages for hire and bed and breakfast/homestay places.

The village is one of the most picturesque in [[New Zealand]] with a backdrop of native forest and [[Mount Ruapehu]]. In the spring, the village trees and gardens are alive with native birds, most notably [[tui (bird)|tui]] and [[Kererū]]. A delightful domain set amongst native forest features large open playing fields, children&amp;apos;s play area and two tennis courts.

==Location==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Owhango&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is located on the 39° [[latitude]] line, placing it on the boundary of the old [[Auckland Province]] and [[Wellington Province]]s.  Half way through Owhango is the sign marking &amp;quot;39° South&amp;quot;. This sign is accurate (to within a few metres) when using NZ [[datum (geodesy)|Geodetic Datum]] 1949. The position of 39° South when using [[WGS84]] (or NZ Geodetic Datum 2000) is about 196 metres further south.

The local sports teams are generally dressed in green and white.  Historically (esp. in the [[Timeline of New Zealand history#1950s|1950s]]) the Owhango Domain played host to a sub-regional annual sports day.

The &amp;quot;Owhango Hall&amp;quot; is used for community meetups, and is &amp;lt;u&amp;gt;just&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt; big enough for the one [[badminton]] court.

==Recreation==

The native forest is part of the [[Ohinetonga Scenic Reserve]] which contains unlogged old growth native forest containing some forest giants and a pretty lagoon accessible from a looped walking track. A road through the reserve - signposted from the State Highway - leads down to one of New Zealand&amp;apos;s most famous river scenes, the view from the old logging bridge over the [[Whakapapa River]]. Along the river are memorable picnic spots with superb swimming pools containing [[rainbow trout|rainbow]] and [[brown trout]]. And also a launch point for Kayakist heading for Kakahi, or even further down the [[Whanganui River]].

Beyond the bridge is the vast expanse of [[Tongariro Forest]], once the source of timber for the local mill, but now protected as conservation land thanks to a successful campaign in the [[Timeline of New Zealand history#1980s|1980s]] led by local people to save the forest from clearance . Bisecting the forest is one of New Zealand&amp;apos;s best mountain bike rides, the &amp;quot;[[42 Traverse]]&amp;quot;. The forest also has excellent tramping, camping and deer hunting opportunities. In the heart of the regenerating forest is one of only a handful of national [[kiwi]] sanctuaries where the [[New Zealand Department of Conservation|Department of Conservation]] controls alien predators to protect a population of the [[North Island]] [[kiwi|Brown Kiwi]].

==History==
[[File:The old Owhango Post Office (c.1919).JPG|thumb|The old Owhango Post Office (c.1919)]]
There also is an interesting derelict Swimming pool ({{coord|38|59.77|S|175|22.32|E|region:NZ_type:landmark}}) actually constructed into the bed of the [[Kakahi]] Stream located 1&amp;amp;nbsp;km west down the Ohinematua Road off [[New Zealand State Highway network|State Highway 4]] north of Owhango.  The pool was created by eager locals in the hope of preparing one of the local athletes in to the [[British Empire and Commonwealth Games]].

The &amp;quot;Owhango Hall&amp;quot; was originally used as a silent movies cinema [http://www.cinematour.com/tour.php?db=fo&amp;amp;id=4075] seating 250.

Owhango is a [[Māori people|Māori]] name that translates as &amp;quot;the place of wheezy noises&amp;quot;.
