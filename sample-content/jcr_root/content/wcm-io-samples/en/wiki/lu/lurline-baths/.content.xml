The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lurline Baths&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were public [[Brine|salt water]] [[Public bath|bath]]s built in 1894 in [[San Francisco, California]] at the corner of Bush and Larkin streets. The Lurline Baths closed in 1936. The Lurline Pier at Ocean Beach between Anza and Balboa Streets, was built to protect the intake pipe which provided seawater to the Lurline Baths. The pier existed until about 1966.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;wrca&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

The Olympic Salt Water Company owned the baths that included a [[swimming pool]] and [[water slide]]. Founded in 1892, the company also supplied water to the [[Olympic Club]] as well as smaller commercial baths. Use of sea water for bathing and in swimming pools was common in the 19th century before pollution became an issue. The company built a water distribution system of the intake pipe located 600 feet offshore, almost 4 miles of iron pipe along present-day [[Geary Boulevard]], a water pump, and the reservoir tank located on Laurel Heights. Gravity brought the water to downtown and the customers.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;wrca&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/WRCA/pdfs/news63.pdf Kelley, Tim Water Resources Center Archives Newsletter &amp;quot;Olympic Salt Water Company&amp;quot;] Vol,6. No.3, October 1999 Accessed July16, 2010&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The baths were immortalized by [[Thomas Edison]] in August, 1897 when he captured 20 seconds of film featuring scenes from the Lurline pool.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?ammem/papr:@field(NUMBER+@band(edmp+0063)) US Library of Congress, &amp;quot;American Memory&amp;quot; Series] Accessed July 16, 2010&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
