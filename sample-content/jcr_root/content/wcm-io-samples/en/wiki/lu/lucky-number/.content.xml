In [[number theory]], a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;lucky number&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[natural number]] in a set which is generated by a &amp;quot;[[sieve theory|sieve]]&amp;quot; similar to the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] that generates the [[prime number|primes]].

Begin with a list of [[integer]]s starting with 1:

 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
Every second number (all [[even number]]s) is eliminated, leaving only the odd integers:

 1,    3,    5,    7,    9,   11,   13,   15,   17,   19,   21,   23,   25,
The second term in this [[sequence]] is 3. Every third number which remains in the list is eliminated:

 1,    3,          7,    9,         13,   15,         19,   21,         25,
The next surviving number is now 7, so every seventh number that remains is eliminated:

 1,    3,          7,    9,         13,   15,               21,         25,
When this procedure has been carried out completely, the survivors are the lucky numbers:

: [[1 (number)|1]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[9 (number)|9]], [[13 (number)|13]], [[15 (number)|15]], [[21 (number)|21]], [[25 (number)|25]], [[31 (number)|31]], [[33 (number)|33]], [[37 (number)|37]], [[43 (number)|43]], [[49 (number)|49]], [[51 (number)|51]], [[63 (number)|63]], [[67 (number)|67]], [[69 (number)|69]], [[73 (number)|73]], [[75 (number)|75]], [[79 (number)|79]], [[87 (number)|87]], [[93 (number)|93]], [[99 (number)|99]], ... {{OEIS|id=A000959}}.

The term was introduced in 1956 in a paper by Gardiner, Lazarus, [[Nicholas Metropolis|Metropolis]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam|Ulam]].  They suggest also calling its defining sieve, &amp;quot;the sieve of [[Josephus]] Flavius&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Gardiner et al (1956)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; because of its similarity with the counting-out game in the [[Josephus problem]].

Lucky numbers share some properties with primes, such as asymptotic behaviour according to the [[prime number theorem]]; also, a version of [[Goldbach&amp;apos;s conjecture]] has been extended to them. There are infinitely many lucky numbers.  However, if &amp;apos;&amp;apos;L&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;n&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; denotes the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;n&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-th lucky number, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;p&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;n&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;n&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-th prime, then &amp;apos;&amp;apos;L&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;n&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;p&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;n&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; for all sufficiently large &amp;apos;&amp;apos;n&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal | zbl=0084.04202 | last1=Hawkins | first1=D. | last2=Briggs | first2=W.E. | title=The lucky number theorem | journal=[[Mathematics Magazine]] | volume=31 | pages=81–84,277–280 | year=1957 | issn=0025-570X | doi=10.2307/3029213 | issue=2 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Because of these apparent connections with the prime numbers, some mathematicians have suggested that these properties may be found in a larger class of sets of numbers generated by sieves of a certain unknown form, although there is little theoretical basis for this [[conjecture]]. Twin lucky numbers and [[twin prime]]s also appear to occur with similar frequency.

A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;lucky prime&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a lucky number that is prime. It is not known whether there are infinitely many lucky primes. The first few are
:3, 7, 13, 31, 37, 43, 67, 73, 79, 127, 151, 163, 193 {{OEIS|id=A031157}}.
