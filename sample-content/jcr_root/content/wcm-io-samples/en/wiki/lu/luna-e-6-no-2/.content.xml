&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Luna E-6 No.2&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also identified as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;No.1&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and sometimes known in the West as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sputnik 25&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spacecraft which launched in 1963, but was placed into a useless orbit due to a problem with the upper stage of the rocket that launched it. It was a {{convert|1500|kg|adj=on}} [[Luna E-6]] spacecraft,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;EA-E6&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lunae6.htm|title=Luna E-6|last=Wade|first=Mark|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; the first of twelve to be launched,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;GSP&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/luna_e6.htm|title=Luna E-6|last=Krebs|first=Gunter|publisher=Gunter&amp;apos;s Space Page|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was intended to be the first spacecraft to perform a [[soft landing (rocketry)|soft landing]] on the [[Moon]], a goal which would eventually be accomplished by the final E-6 spacecraft, [[Luna 9]].

Luna E-6 No.2 was launched at 08:49 UTC on 4 January 1963, atop a [[Molniya-L]] 8K78L [[carrier rocket]],&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;GSP&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; flying from [[Gagarin&amp;apos;s Start|Site 1/5]] at the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;LL&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|publisher=Jonathan&amp;apos;s Space Page|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The lower stages of the rocket performed nominally, delivering the upper stage and payload into [[low Earth orbit]], however a [[transformer]] in the upper stage malfunctioned, which resulted in its [[ullage motors]] failing to ignite when the stage began its start-up sequence, sixty six minutes after launch.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;EA-R7&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/soyuz.htm|title=Soyuz|last=Wade|first=Mark|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zarya.info/Diaries/Luna/Luna.php|title=USSR - Luna|last=Christy|first=Robert|publisher=Zarya.info|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It remained in low Earth orbit until it decayed on 11 January 1963.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;satcat&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|publisher=Jonathan&amp;apos;s Space Page|accessdate=28 July 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was the first spacecraft to be launched in 1963, and consequently the first to be assigned an [[International Designator]], under the new system which had been introduced at the start of the year.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;LL&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

The spacecraft consisted of a cylindrical section containing rockets and fuel for manoeuvring, attitude control and landing, as well as radio transmitters, and a {{convert|100|kg|adj=on}} instrumented probe, which would have been ejected onto the surface after the spacecraft landed, carrying a camera and devices to measure radiation. It was intended to return data on the mechanical characteristics of the lunar surface, the hazards presented by the topology such as craters, rocks, and other obstructions, and radiation, in preparation for future manned landings.

The designations Sputnik 33, and later Sputnik 25 were used by the [[United States Naval Space Command]] to identify the spacecraft in its [[Satellite Situation Summary]] documents, since the Soviet Union did not release the internal designations of its spacecraft at that time, and had not assigned it an official name due to its failure to depart [[geocentric orbit]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://filer.case.edu/~sjr16/advanced/20th_soviet_sputnik.html|title=Soviet Craft - Sputnik|last=Robbins|first=Stuart J.|date=11 January 2006|publisher=Journey Through The Galaxy|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
