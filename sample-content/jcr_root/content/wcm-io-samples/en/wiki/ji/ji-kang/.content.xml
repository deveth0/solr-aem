{{Chinese name|Ji}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ji Kang&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xi Kang&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ({{zh|嵇康}}, 223–262) was a Chinese author, poet, Taoist philosopher, musician and alchemist. He was one of the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]] who engaged in separating themselves from the dangerous political situation of third century China, in favor of devoting themselves to a life of art and leisure. Ji Kang is noted as an author and musical composer.

==Biography==
As a thinker, Ji Kang wrote on longevity, music theory, politics and ethics. Among his works were &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yangsheng Lun&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Essay on Nourishing Life), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shengwu Aile Lun&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (on the Absence of Sentiments in Music), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Qin Fu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (A Composition on the [[Guqin|Qin]]), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shisi Lun&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Discourse on Individuality). As a musician, Ji Kang composed a number of solo pieces for [[Guqin|Qin]].

Ji Kang was highly critical of [[Confucianism]] and challenged many social conventions of his time. As such, he was considered scandalous and seditious. He married Cao Cao&amp;apos;s granddaughter (or great-granddaughter according to some). Ji assumed a post under the Wei, but was not particularly interested in government work. When [[Sima Zhao]] came to power, he intended to grant Ji a position as a civil official. However, Ji was uncooperative and behaved insolently to Zhong Hui, who was sent to inform him of Sima&amp;apos;s offer. Later, one of Ji&amp;apos;s friends was imprisoned after being framed. Ji defended him and testified in his case, and was also sent to jail as a result. Following Zhong Hui&amp;apos;s advice, Sima Zhao sentenced Ji to death. Three thousand university students signed a petition to release him, but the appeal was denied. Before his execution, Ji Kang asked for his zither and played his swan song, the famous guqin masterpiece &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Guangling san&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which music is presumed to be forever lost.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://the-scholars.com/viewtopic.php?p=508746#p508746&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
