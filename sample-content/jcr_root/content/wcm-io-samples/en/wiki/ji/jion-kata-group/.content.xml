        text="&lt;p&gt;:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This article is about the [[kata]], for the Japanese weapon, see [[jutte (weapon)]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ji&amp;apos;in&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jutte&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; form a group of [[kata]] used in [[Shotokan]], [[Seiyo Shorin-Ryu Karate and Kobudo|Shorin-ryu (Seiyo Kai)]], and other [[karate]] styles, beginning with the same characteristic [[kamae]] of the left hand covering the right, which apparently has roots in ancient Chinese boxing.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  Their origin is thought to be from the [[Tomari-te]] school, however [[Hirokazu Kanazawa]] speculates that the Jion kata were devised in the Jionji 慈恩寺, the Jion temple, where martial arts were famously practiced. From there, Kanazawa believes the Jion kata were spread into the Tomari region.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Karate: The Complete Kata; Kanazawa, H.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Ji&amp;apos;in==
Ji&amp;apos;in 慈陰 (&amp;quot;Inverted Mercy&amp;quot;) is important for the execution of many simultaneous techniques and the often-repeated stances, enabling swift changes of direction while maintaining balance, power and steps of equal length. It has, however, been removed from the Japan Karate Association teaching and grading syllabus.

==Jion==
Jion 慈恩 (&amp;quot;Mercy&amp;quot;) is a representative kata in the Shotokan system because of the importance of the perfection of the basic stances it contains, notably [[zenkutsu dachi]] (front stance) and [[kiba dachi]] (horse stance).
Also practiced in some [[Shito Ryu]] organizations, emphasis is also placed on [[kokutsu dachi]], the kata is noticeably shorter than its Shotokan counterpart.

==Jutte==
The mastery of Jutte 十手 (&amp;quot;Ten Hands&amp;quot;) should in theory enable one to face ten adversaries.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Some{{Who|date=March 2009}} claim that the name is derived from the position of the raised fists, resembling a type of [[Sai (weapon)|sai]] known as a [[Jutte (weapon)|jutte]], which occurs a number of times in the kata. This rather short kata of only 24 movements contains a number of defences that can be implemented against the [[Bo (weapon)|bo]]. Sometimes spelled Jitte due to incorrect romanisation of Japanese, similar to the [[jutsu]] and jitsu differences. Also known in some styles as Sip Soo.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
