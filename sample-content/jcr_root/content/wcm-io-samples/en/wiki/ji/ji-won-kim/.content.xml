In 1979, Kim won the gold medal in the flyweight division at the [[International Military Sports Council|CISM Amateur Boxing Championships]] in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], beating Oudahi Mohammad Amin of [[Algeria]] via first round knockout in the final bout.

In February 1980, Kim participated in the [[Asian Amateur Boxing Championships]] held in [[Bombay]], [[India]]. There he captured the gold medal in the [[flyweight]] division. In April 1980, Kim won the flyweight gold medal at the King&amp;apos;s Cup Boxing, beating future [[1982 World Amateur Boxing Championships|World Amateur Boxing Championship]] bronze medalist [[Constantin Titoiu]] of [[Romania]] in the final bout.

In 1981, Kim won the [[bantamweight]] gold medal at the King&amp;apos;s Cup Boxing, defeating future [[Commonwealth Games]] gold medalist [[Hussein Khalili]] of [[Kenya]] in the final.

==Pro career==
On 17 May 1983 the [[left-handed|southpaw]] defeated Chan-Jung Chun for the Korean super bantamweight title. Four months later he fought Little Bangoyan for the vacant [[Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation]] (OPBF) title, capturing it with a twlve-round decision. For the next year Kim made five defenses of his OPBF title against the likes of Lito Cortez (KO 2), Rolando Navarro (PTS 12), and Fel Malatag (TKO 6).

On 3 January 1985, he fought countryman and reigning [[International Boxing Federation]] [[super bantamweight]] champion [[Sung-In Suh]]. Kim won via a tenth round stoppage. Kim would make four successful defenses of his title against future [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[featherweight]] champion [[Ruben Dario Palacios]] (W15, 30 March 1985), former [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[super bantamweight]] champions Bobby Berna (KO 4, 28 June 1985) and Sung-In Suh (KO 1, 9 October 1985), and Rudy Casicas (KO 2, 2 May 1986).

In December 1986, he retired from boxing in order to become a theatrical actor and singer, finishing with a record of 16 wins, no losses, and two ties, both ties coming from the same boxer. He would become one of the few world champions to retire undefeated.
