:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This article is about the mountaineer. For the [[politician]], see [[Jim Whitaker]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;James W. Whittaker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jim Whittaker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] on February 10, 1929 &amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;everesthistory&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.everesthistory.com/climbers/whittaker.htm EverestHistory.com: Jim Whittaker]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) is an [[United States|American]] [[Mountaineering|mountaineer]].

As a member of the [[American Mount Everest Expedition 1963]] led by [[Norman Dyhrenfurth]], he was the first American to reach the summit of [[Mount Everest]].  He summited on May 1, 1963 with the [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] [[Nawang Gombu]] (a nephew of [[Tenzing Norgay]]).  They ran out of oxygen but managed to reach the summit.  Once there, Whittaker planted a [[flag of the United States|US flag]] at the top.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;apos;ngam&amp;apos;&amp;gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Shnayerson | coauthors= | title=Jim Whittaker, Back on Earth | date=May 2003 | publisher= | url =http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0305/story.html#story_2 | work =National Geographic Adventure Magazine | pages = | accessdate = 2007-05-07 | language = }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He is the twin brother of [[Lou Whittaker]], a mountain guide who is often mistakenly credited with that achievement.

Whittaker graduated from [[West Seattle High School]] and [[Seattle University]].

He was the first full-time employee of [[Recreational Equipment Inc.]] and was the company&amp;apos;s CEO in the 1960s.
Now, Whittaker is chairman of the Board of [[Magellan Navigation]], a company that produces handheld [[global positioning system]] (GPS) units.

In 1965 he guided [[Robert Kennedy]] up the newly-named [[Mount Kennedy]].

He led the [[Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb]] that brought together climbers from the [[United States]], [[USSR]] and [[China]] to summit Mount Everest. In addition to putting more than a dozen climbers on the summit, the expedition hauled off a large amount of trash left on the mountain by previous expeditions.

In 1999 Whittaker released his autobiography, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Life on the Edge: Memoirs of Everest and Beyond&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Awards and honors==
*For being the first American to scale Mount Everest, Whittaker was awarded the [[Hubbard Medal]] by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[John F. Kennedy]].

{{cquote|If you aren&amp;apos;t living on the edge, you are taking up too much space.}}

{{cquote|You never conquer a mountain. Mountains can&amp;apos;t be conquered; you conquer yourself.}}

(This is essentially equivalent to George Mallory&amp;apos;s question and answer: &amp;quot;Have we conquered an enemy? None but ourselves,&amp;quot; quoted in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Everest: the West Ridge,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; p.&amp;amp;nbsp;27. )
