He was born in a Polish town in what is now [[Ukraine]]. Widespread adoption of his patented [[catheters]] for dialysis resulted in a significant decrease in infections among kidney patients, and his devices are commonly found in hospitals and dialysis centers worldwide. Twardowski is associated with the Department of [[Internal Medicine]] at the [[University of Missouri]] at Columbia.
