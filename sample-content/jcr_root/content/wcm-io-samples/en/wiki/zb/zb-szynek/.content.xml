&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zbąszynek&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-pl|z|b|ą|&amp;apos;|sz|y|n|e|k}} ({{lang-de|Neu Bentschen}}) is a town in western [[Poland]], in [[Lubusz Voivodeship]], in [[Świebodzin County]]. It has 5,185 inhabitants (2004).

==History==
The town was founded in the 1920s, when, as a result of the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919)]] as well as the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the railroad hub of [[Zbaszyn]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bentschen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) became part of newly re-created [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. In 1922, the government of Germany decided to create from scratch a new border station, a new rail hub (which replaced Zbaszyn) as well as a settlement for railroad workers. Within a few years, a large station was constructed, together with a modern garden-settlement, based on a project by architect [[Friedrich Veil]]. The town, named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Neu Bentschen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was inhabited by ethnic Germans, railroad workers, who came there from different parts of the [[Weimar Republic]]. There were two churches, a printing shop, a house of culture (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Deutsches Haus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), a school, a mail office and a bank. The settlement belonged to the [[Miedzyrzecz|Meseritz]] county.

During [[World War II]]  the Germans opened there a work camp for POWs, in which various soldiers were kept - from [[Soviet Union]], [[France]], [[Italy]], as well as Jews from the [[Łódź Ghetto]]. Hundreds died of diseases and exhaustion, those who survived, worked on the rail infrastructure, which was necessary for transports to the eastern front.

In January 1945 German inhabitants of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Neu Bentschen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, fearing the advancing [[Red Army]] escaped behind the [[Oder]], and the town was captured without fighting. As a result of the [[territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II]] following the [[Potsdam Conference]], it was part of the German territory annexed to Poland. It was briefly called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nowy Zbaszyn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, some time in late 1940s, the name was changed.
