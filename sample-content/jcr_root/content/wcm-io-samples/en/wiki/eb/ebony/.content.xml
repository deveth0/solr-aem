&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ebony&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a dense black wood, most commonly yielded by several species in the genus &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Diospyros]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but may also refer to other heavy, black (or dark colored) woods from unrelated species. Ebony is dense enough to sink in water. Its fine texture and very smooth finish when polished, make it valuable as an ornamental wood. The word &amp;quot;ebony&amp;quot; derives from the [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;hbny&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, via the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἔβενος}} (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ébenos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), by way of [[Latin]] and [[Middle English]].

== Species ==
Species of ebony include &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Diospyros ebenum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Ceylon ebony), native to southern [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]]; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Diospyros crassiflora]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Gaboon ebony), native to western [[Africa]]; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Diospyros celebica]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Makassar ebony), native to Indonesia and prized for its luxuriant, multi-colored wood grain. Mauritius ebony, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Diospyros tesselaria&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was largely exploited by the Dutch in the 17th century. Some species in the genus &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Diospyros&amp;apos;&amp;apos; yield an  ebony with similar physical properties, but striped rather than evenly black (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Diospyros ebenum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

== Uses ==

Ebony has a long history of use, with carved pieces having been found in [[Ancient Egypt]]ian tombs.
By the end of the 16th century, fine cabinets for the luxury trade were made of ebony in [[Antwerp]]. The wood&amp;apos;s dense hardness lent itself to refined moldings framing finely detailed pictorial panels with carving in very low relief ([[bas-relief]]), usually of allegorical subjects, or with scenes taken from classical or Christian history. Within a short time, such cabinets were also being made in [[Paris]], where their makers became known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[ébéniste]]s&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which remains the French term for a [[cabinetmaker]].

Modern uses are largely restricted to small items, such as [[crucifixes]], and [[musical instrument]] parts, including black [[piano]] and [[harpsichord]] keys, [[violin]], [[viola]], [[guitar]], [[double bass]], and [[cello]] fingerboards, [[tailpiece]]s, [[Tuning peg|pegs]], [[chinrest]]s, and [[bow (music)|bow frogs]]. Many plectrums, or guitar picks, are made from this black wood. Traditionally, the black pieces in [[chess piece|chess sets]] were made from ebony, with rare [[Buxus|boxwood]]  or [[ivory]] being used for the white pieces. Modern East Midlands-style lace-making [[bobbin]]s, also being small, are often made of ebony and look particularly decorative when bound with brass or silver wire. Due to its strength, many handgun grips and rifle fore-end tips are made of ebony, as are the [[Pool_cue#Butt|butts of pool cues]].

As a result of unsustainable harvesting, many species yielding ebony are now considered threatened. Africa in particular has had most of its indigenous ebony cut down illegally, and for this reason it has become common for street traders to blacken lighter woods with shoe polish in an effort to make a sale.
