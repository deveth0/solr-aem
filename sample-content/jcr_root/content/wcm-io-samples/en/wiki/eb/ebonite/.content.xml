&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ebonite&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a brand name for very hard [[rubber]] first obtained by [[Charles Goodyear]] by [[vulcanization|vulcanizing]] rubber for prolonged periods. It is about 30% to 40% [[sulfur]]. Its name comes from its intended use as an artificial substitute for [[ebony]] wood.  The material is known generically as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hard rubber&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and has formerly been called &amp;quot;vulcanite&amp;quot;,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;WebstersThird_2002_vulcanite&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Citation | author = Merriam-Webster | year = 2002 | origyear = 1961 | title = vulcanite | work = [[Webster&amp;apos;s Third New International Dictionary|Webster&amp;apos;s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged]] | publisher = Merriam-Webster | location = Springfield, Massachusetts, USA | url = http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com | ref = harv | postscript =. }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; although that name now refers to the mineral [[vulcanite]].

==Applications==
It is often used in [[bowling ball]]s, electric plugs, [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipe]] mouthpieces, [[fountain pen]] bodies and nib feeds, and [[saxophone]] and [[clarinet]] [[mouthpiece (woodwind)|mouthpieces]]. It is, rarely, used for the body of high quality clarinets. Hard  rubber is also often seen as the wheel material in [[casters]].  It is also commonly used in [[physics]] classrooms to demonstrate [[static electricity]].

Hard rubber was used in the cases of automobile [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] for years, thus establishing black as their traditional colour even long after stronger modern plastics were substituted.  It is used in hair combs made by Ace, part of [[Newell Rubbermaid]], which survive, essentially unchanged, from the days of the [[American Civil War|US Civil War]]. Ebonite is used as an anticorrosive lining for various (mainly storage) vessels that contain [[hydrochloric acid]]. It forms bubbles when storing [[hydrofluoric acid]] at temperatures above room temperature, or for prolonged durations.

==Properties==
The material is brittle, which produces problems in its use in battery cases for example, where the integrity of the case is vital to prevent leakage of [[sulfuric acid]]. It has now been generally replaced by [[carbon black]]-filled [[polypropylene]].

==Contamination==
Ebonite contamination was a big problem when it was used for electronics. The ebonite was rolled between metal foil sheets, which were peeled off, leaving traces of metal behind. For electronic use the surface was ground to remove metal particles.
