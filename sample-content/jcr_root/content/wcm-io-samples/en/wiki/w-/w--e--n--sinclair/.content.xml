        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;William Edmund Newton Sinclair&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (June 28, 1873 â€“ November 26, 1947), known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;W.E.N. Sinclair&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was a [[Canada|Canadian]] barrister, solicitor and politician.

He was born in [[Whitby Township, Ontario]], the son of John Sinclair, and was educated at [[University of Toronto|Toronto University]], receiving a bachelor&amp;apos;s degree in law. In 1907, he married Ella Minerva Montgomery; he married Edna Worden in 1918 after his first wife&amp;apos;s death.

Sinclair was first elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] as a candidate of the [[Ontario Liberal Party]] in the [[Ontario general election, 1911|1911 provincial election]] but was defeated in [[Ontario general election, 1914|1914]].

He returned to politics in the [[Canadian federal election, 1917|1917 federal election]] on [[conscription]] (see [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]]), Sinclair ran on as part of the anti-conscription &amp;quot;[[Laurier Liberals]]&amp;quot; but was again defeated.

He returned to provincial politics and was elected again to the Ontario legislature in the [[Ontario general election, 1919|1919 provincial election]] as the [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]] for the riding of Ontario South.

Sinclair ran for the leadership of the party in the 1922 [[Ontario Liberal leadership conventions|leadership convention]], but lost to [[Wellington Hay]]. Hay resigned following a disastrous election result, and Sinclair served as [[interim leader]] of the [[Ontario Liberal Party]] from 1923 to 1930 and also as [[Leader of the Opposition (Ontario)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the provincial legislature. He was interim leader for that length of time (and through the elections of [[Ontario general election, 1926|1926]] and [[Ontario general election, 1929|1929]]) because of the party&amp;apos;s state of disorganization and inability to hold a proper [[leadership convention]].

The Liberals remained at the 14 seats they had in 1926, and dropped to 13 seats in the 1929 election. Sinclair initially decided to run for the permanent leadership in 1930, but because of the party&amp;apos;s failure to make gains during his tenure, he attracted little support, and withdrew before balloting began. He remained [[Leader of the Opposition (Ontario)|Leader of the Opposition]] until the [[Ontario general election, 1934|1934 election]] because the newly-elected leader, [[Mitchell Hepburn]], did not have a seat in the provincial legislature. Sinclair was re-elected in the 1934 election that brought the Liberals to power but Hepburn, the new [[Premier of Ontario]], did not appoint him to [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]. Sinclair sat as a government [[backbench]]er for three years and then retired from the legislature at the [[Ontario general election, 1937|1937 provincial election]].

In the [[Canadian federal election, 1945|1945 federal election]], Sinclair was elected to the [[Canadian House of Commons]] for the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. He died in office in 1947.

Sinclair also served as mayor of [[Oshawa]] from 1910 to 1911, in 1915 and from 1932 to 1934.
