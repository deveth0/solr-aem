&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;St Olaves&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] in the [[England|English]] [[county]] of [[Norfolk]]. The village is situated on the [[River Waveney]] in England, some {{convert|10|km|0}} south-west of the town of [[Great Yarmouth]] and the same distance north-west of the [[Suffolk]] town of [[Lowestoft]]. It is within [[The Broads National Park]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ordnance Survey (2005). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;OS Explorer Map OL40 - The Broads&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. ISBN 0-319-23769-9.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Today the village forms part of the [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of [[Fritton and St Olaves]], which in turn is within the [[Non-metropolitan district|district]] of [[Great Yarmouth (borough)|Great Yarmouth]] in Norfolk. However prior to the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the village was within [[Lothingland Rural District]] in Suffolk.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Local Government Act 1972]], Schedule 1 Part II Non-metropolitan counties.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

St Olaves Bridge, a [[suspension bridge]], is the first bridging point on the Waveney above [[Great Yarmouth]]. [[Haddiscoe railway station]], on the [[Wherry Lines]] service between [[Norwich]] and [[Lowestoft]], is across the bridge approximately {{convert|1|km|0}} from the centre of the village. St Olaves used to have its own [[St Olaves railway station]], but this is now closed.

On the site of the [[St. Olaves Priory, Herringfleet|priory]] dedicated to St Olaves, there is Priory Mill, a drainage windpump.
