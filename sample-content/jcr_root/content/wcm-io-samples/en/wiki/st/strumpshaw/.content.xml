&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Strumpshaw&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[English county]] of [[Norfolk]]. It is located on the northern bank of the [[River Yare]] around {{convert|6|mi|km}} south-east of [[Norwich]] within [[The Broads National Park]]. The parish covers an area of {{convert|11.69|km2|abbr=on}} and had a population of 602 in 245 households as of the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.norfolk.gov.uk/consumption/groups/public/documents/general_resources/ncc017867.xls Census population and household counts for unparished urban areas and all parishes]. Office for National Statistics &amp;amp; Norfolk County Council (2001). Retrieved 20 June 2009.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; For the purposes of local government, it falls within the [[Non-metropolitan district|district]] of [[Broadland]].

The village lies a little distance from the river, on the slopes of Strumpshaw Hill, the highest area of land in the [[Norfolk Broads]]. Because of its elevation, Strumpshaw hosted, from the late 1790s through to the mid-1810s, a repeater station in the [[Semaphore line#London - Great Yarmouth|shutter telegraph chain]] linking the Admiralty in London with Great Yarmouth. The [[Wherry Lines]] railway line running between Norwich and [[Great Yarmouth]] and [[Lowestoft]] runs through the parish. Trains call at [[Buckenham railway station]] at weekends only.

The small villages of [[Buckenham]] and [[Hassingham]], formally both parishes in their own right, lie within the civil parish of Strumpshaw.

==Strumpshaw Hall==
Strumpshaw Hall lies closer to the river, next to the railway line. It is the home of the [[Strumpshaw Hall Steam Museum]], with a collection of [[Traction engine]]s, and [[Steam roller]]s. It also has a [[Showman&amp;apos;s engine]], a [[Steam wagon]] and a [[narrow gauge railway]] with a [[Simplex]] diesel disguised as a steam engine.

==Natural environment==
The [[Strumpshaw Fen RSPB reserve]] is operated by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. It caters for up to 20000 visitors annually. It is bordered to the east by [[Buckenham Marshes RSPB reserve]] and lies within the [[Mid-Yare NNR|Mid-Yare National Nature Reserve]] and [[Yare Broads and Marshes]] [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]].
