&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;St. Hedwig&amp;apos;s Cathedral&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-de|Sankt-Hedwigs-Kathedrale}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[cathedral]] on the [[Bebelplatz]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Berlin|archbishop of Berlin]].
[[File:Berlin Hedwigskathedrale.jpg|thumb|left|Cathedral interior]]
It was built in the 18th century as the first Catholic church in [[Prussia]] after the [[Protestant Reformation]] by permission of King [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]]. The intention of Frederick was to offer the numerous Catholic immigrants that had arrived in Berlin, especially those from [[Upper Silesia]], a place of worship. The church was therefore dedicated to the patron of [[Silesia]] and [[Brandenburg]], Saint [[Hedwig of Andechs]]. The building was designed by [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]] modeled after the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon in Rome]] and construction started in 1747, interrupted and delayed several times due to economy measures. It was not until November 1, 1773 when the king&amp;apos;s friend, [[Ignacy Krasicki]], then [[Bishop of Warmia]] (later [[Archbishop of Gniezno]]), officiated at the cathedral&amp;apos;s opening.

After the [[Kristallnacht]] pogroms that took place over the night of 9â€“10 November 1938, [[Bernhard Lichtenberg]], a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of the [[cathedral chapter]] of St Hedwig since 1931, prayed publicly for Jews in the evening prayer following. Lichtenberg was later jailed by the Nazis and died on the way to the [[concentration camp]] at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. In 1965 Lichtenberg&amp;apos;s remains were transferred to the [[crypt]] at St. Hedwig&amp;apos;s.

The cathedral burned out completely in 1943 during air raids on Berlin and was reconstructed from 1952 up to 1963.
