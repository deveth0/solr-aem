A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;strophe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a poetic term originally referring to the first part of the [[ode]] in Ancient Greek tragedy, followed by the [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]]. The term has been extended to also mean a structural division of a poem containing stanzas of varying line length. In poems composed of similar units, such as [[Epic poetry|epic poems]], the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;strophic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is synonymous with [[stanza]]ic.

In its original Greek setting, &amp;quot;strophe, antistrophe and epode were a kind of [[stanza]] framed only for the music,&amp;quot; as [[John Milton]] wrote in the preface to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Samson Agonistes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, with the strophe chanted by a [[Greek chorus]] as it moved from right to left across the scene.

==Etymology==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Strophe&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|r|oʊ|f|iː}} {{respell|STROH|fee}}; [[Greek language|Greek]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[wikt:στροφή|στροφή]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;turn, bend, twist&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, see also [[phrase]]) is a concept in [[poetry|versification]] which properly means a turn, as from one [[Foot (prosody)|foot]] to another, or from one side of a chorus to the other.

==Poetic structure==
In a more general sense, the strophe is a pair of stanzas of alternating form on which the structure of a given poem is based, with the strophe usually being identical with the [[stanza]] in modern poetry and its arrangement and recurrence of rhymes giving it its character. But the Greeks called a combination of verse-periods a system, giving the name &amp;quot;strophe&amp;quot; to such a system only when it was repeated once or more in unmodified form.

==Origins &amp;amp; development==
It is said that [[Archilochus of Paros|Archilochus]] first created the strophe by binding together systems of two or three lines. But it was the [[Greece|Greek]] ode-writers who introduced the practice of strophe-writing on a large scale, and the art was attributed to [[Stesichorus]], although it is probable that earlier poets were acquainted with it. The arrangement of an [[ode]] in a splendid and consistent artifice of strophe, [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]] was carried to its height by [[Pindar]].

==Variant forms==
With the development of Greek [[Meter (poetry)|prosody]], various peculiar strophe-forms came into general acceptance, and were made celebrated by the frequency with which leading poets employed them. Among these were the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sapphic,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elegiac,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alcaic,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Asclepiadean&amp;apos;&amp;apos; strophe, all of them prominent in Greek and Latin verse. The briefest and the most ancient strophe is the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;dactylic distych,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which consists of two verses of the same class of rhythm, the second producing a melodic counterpart to the first.

==Reproductions==
The forms in modern English verse which reproduce most exactly the impression aimed at by the ancient odestrophe are the elaborate rhymed stanzas of such poems as [[John Keats|Keats]]&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[wikisource:Ode to a Nightingale|Ode to a Nightingale]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or [[Matthew Arnold]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[wikisource:The Scholar-Gipsy|The Scholar-Gipsy]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

A strophic form of poetry called [[Muwashshah]] developed in [[Andalucia]] as early as the 9th century C.E, which then spread to North Africa and the Middle East. Muwashshah was typically in classical Arabic, with the refrain sometimes in the local dialect.
