&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Steeple Claydon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] and also a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] within the district of [[Aylesbury Vale]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].  Steeple Claydon is located about four miles south of [[Buckingham]], six miles north west of [[Waddesdon]]. The village&amp;apos;s name &amp;apos;Claydon&amp;apos; is [[Old English language|Anglo Saxon]] in origin, and means &amp;apos;clay hill&amp;apos;. In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 the area (including the nearby places of [[Botolph Claydon]], [[East Claydon]] and [[Middle Claydon]]) was known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Claindone&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The prefix &amp;apos;Steeple&amp;apos; refers to the steeple of the [[parish church]], which is prominent in the village and was added to differentiate it from the other local places. The [[Manorialism|manor]] of Steeple Claydon was once a [[monarchy|royal]] possession. It was given as a [[wedding]] gift to [[Robert D&amp;apos;Oyly (Osney)|Robert D&amp;apos;Oyly]] by [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] because D&amp;apos;Oyly was marrying one of the king&amp;apos;s former mistresses. Later, after changing hands several times it came into the possession of [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]] when it was left to him in the [[will (law)|will]] of his grandfather the [[Earl of March]]. The [[manor house]] has since been pulled down. [[Thomas Chaloner (regicide)|Thomas Chaloner]], the [[regicide]], built a school in the village in 1656.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=50881#s5 |title=A Topographical Dictionary of England - Claydon, Steeple (St. Michael) |accessdate=13 September 2007 |publisher=British History Online }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This site later became the public library. The current Steeple Claydon School is a mixed, [[Community school (England and Wales)|community]], [[primary school]], which has approximately 150 pupils from the age of four through to the age of eleven.

Today Steeple Claydon is one of the largest villages in the Aylesbury Vale, and it has a very active local [[community]].
