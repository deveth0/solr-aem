:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;For his son, the writer who lived 1885–1939, see [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
[[Image:MalczewskiJacek.1897.PortretStanislawaWitkiewicza.jpg|thumb|Stanisław Witkiewicz.  Portrait by [[Jacek Malczewski]], 1897.]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stanisław Witkiewicz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (8 May 1851 in [[Pašiaušė]] &amp;amp;ndash; 5 September 1915 in [[Lovran]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[painting|painter]], [[architecture|architect]], [[literature|writer]] and [[art theory|art theoretician]].

==Life==
Witkiewicz was born in the [[Lithuania]]n village of [[Pašiaušė]] ({{lang-pl|Poszawsze}}) in [[Samogitia]], at that time, in the [[partitions of Poland|partitioned]] [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] lands ruled by the [[Russian Empire]].

Witkiewicz studied in [[Saint Petersburg]], 1869–71, then in [[Munich]], 1872–75.

He created the [[Zakopane Style of Architecture|Zakopane Style]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;styl zakopiański&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (also known as Witkiewicz Style (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;styl witkiewiczowski&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)) in architecture.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;See picture in [[:pl:styl zakopiański|Polish article on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;styl zakopiański&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was strongly associated with [[Zakopane]] and promoted it in the art community.

His son, [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]], became a famous painter, playwright, novelist and philosopher, also known (from the [[conflation]] of his [[surname]] and [[middle name]]) by the pseudonym &amp;quot;Witkacy.&amp;quot;  The son&amp;apos;s godmother was the internationally famous actress [[Helena Modjeska]] ([[Helena Modrzejewska]]), whom the elder Witkiewicz in 1876 had nearly accompanied to [[California]] in the [[United States]].

Witkiewicz had strong views against formal [[education]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;school is completely at odds with the psychological make-up of human beings&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He applied this principle in his son&amp;apos;s upbringing and was disappointed when the 20-year-old Witkacy chose to enroll at the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Kraków]].

In 1908, suffering from [[tuberculosis]], the elder Witkiewicz left his family in Zakopane and relocated to Lovranno, a fashionable resort in what was then [[Austria-Hungary]], which today is in [[Croatia]]. He died there in 1915.
