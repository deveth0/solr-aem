&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stanbury&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small [[village]] in the metropolitan borough of the [[City of Bradford]] in [[West Yorkshire]], England, west of [[Haworth]], close to the [[Pennine Way]], and on the [[River Worth]]. It is approximately 4 miles from the town of [[Keighley]].  The surrounding countryside is mainly [[moors]] and farmland, but the [[Brontë waterfall]] and [[Top Withens]] tourist attraction are within walking distance.  [[Emily Brontë]] is reputed to have used Top Withens as the model for the location of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wuthering Heights]],&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and nearby [[Ponden Hall]] (half a mile from the back end of Stanbury) has long been considered the model for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thrushcross Grange&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the same book.

There is a school and an [[Anglican]] church in Stanbury village.  The school caters for primary school age children.  There are also two pubs within Stanbury, the Wuthering Heights (formerly, and locally, known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the Cross&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and the Friendly.  The Old Silent Inn (formerly The Eagle) is a pub and guest house located walking distance from the village.

[[Lumbfoot]] is a tiny hamlet located five minutes walking distance from Stanbury.
