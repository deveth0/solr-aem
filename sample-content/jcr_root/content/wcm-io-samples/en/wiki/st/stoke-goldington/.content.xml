&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stoke Goldington&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[Milton Keynes (borough)|Borough of Milton Keynes]] and [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.milton-keynes.gov.uk/parishes/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=17026 Parishes in Milton Keynes] - Milton Keynes Council.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is located about four miles NNW of [[Newport Pagnell]], on the B526, the old road to [[Northampton]].

The village name &amp;apos;Stoke&amp;apos; derives from an [[Old English language]] word &amp;apos;stoc&amp;apos;, which means &amp;apos;place&amp;apos; (Wiki). It came to be used in the context of either a religious or a secondary settlement, and is one of the most common place names in England (see [[Stoke (disambiguation)]]). In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 the village was recorded as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stoche&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The affix &amp;apos;Goldington&amp;apos; came later and refers to &amp;quot;Peter of Goldington&amp;quot; (from [[Goldington]] in [[Bedfordshire]]) who was the principal [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] in the village in the [[medieval]] period.

==Annual Steam Rally==

Every year, at the beginning of May, a steam rally is held, over the Saturday and Sunday selected. When the weather is nice, there is a massive turnout each year, and the little village has become quite respected for that. Even when the weather isn&amp;apos;t so good, there are always the faithful village goers who trundle up there, determined to have fun. On the Saturday evening, there is a magnificent firework display, with rides and a beer tent. The Steam Rally reallyis worthwhile going to, as it has such a variety of stalls, there is something for everyone.
The steam rally was one of the first steam rally&amp;apos;s to introduce a country fayre to its list of attractions and now the whole thing covers many fields in Stoke Goldington.

==Flooding==

Stoke Goldington has been flooded at least three times.  The first flood was very minor, and didn&amp;apos;t really cause that much trouble, so it is not really heard of.  In June 2007, Stoke Goldington was hit by a second flood. There are lots of little streams and brooks round the area, and heavy rain caused them to burst their banks and flow over the land. The flood wasn&amp;apos;t as bad as the later one, but still caused 40 people to have to be evacuated from the area.

The third flooding was by far the worst. It rained heavily again, in July 2007, and caused almost all the rivers nearby to swell. Even some of the houses that had been untouched by the first flood actually witnessed the dirty mudwater creeping up towards their home. Parts of the village were almost three feet underwater, and many homes were badly damaged by the dirt and mud that swirled up. It took up to 2 years for the last people to be able to move back into their homes. Precautions were taken, and for many months after the flood, sandbags were to be seen outside people&amp;apos;s doors.
