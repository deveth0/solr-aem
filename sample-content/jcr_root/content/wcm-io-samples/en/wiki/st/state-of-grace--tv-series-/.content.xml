&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;State of Grace&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[United States|American]] [[comedy-drama]] series that ran for two seasons on the [[Fox Network]]&amp;apos;s [[ABC Family|Fox Family]] channel during 2001 and 2002.

==Plot==

It is centered on two 12-year-old girls from very different backgrounds, Hannah and Grace, who are best friends. Hannah is from a middle class [[Jewish]] family and lives with her parents, her grandmother, and her uncle. Her parents are the owners of a furniture factory in the fictitious town of Ashmore, [[North Carolina]], where they have recently moved to from [[Chicago]]. Grace is from a wealthy Catholic family and lives with her mother, a socialite. Typically, they are depicted as more intelligent, thoughtful, funny, and rebellious than other children of their age. Set in 1965, the show was compared by some to another look-back-through-the-years show, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Wonder Years]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  [[Fred Savage]], the star of that hit ABC series, even appeared in the series&amp;apos; final episode.

The theme song is the original version of: &amp;quot;[[Do You Believe In Magic (song)|Do You Believe in Magic]]&amp;quot; by [[The Lovin&amp;apos; Spoonful]]. The show was taped at [[Ren-Mar Studios]] stage 4.
