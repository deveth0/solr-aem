        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Starship Troopers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[board wargame]] by [[Avalon Hill]] based on the [[Starship Troopers|novel]] of the same name by [[Robert A. Heinlein]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;WD&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal|title=Open Box: Starship Troopers (review)|journal=[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]|issue=1|date=June/July 1977|author=Martin Easterbrook|publisher=[[Games Workshop]]|pages=13}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was originally released in 1976 and designed by Randall C. Reed.  Avalon Hill redesigned and re-released a &amp;quot;movie&amp;quot; version (entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Starship Troopers: Prepare for Battle!&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) in 1997 to coincide with the [[Starship Troopers (film)|movie&amp;apos;s]] release.

The game is a [[Hex map|hexagon-based]] wargame for two players. The player who takes the side of [[Bug (Starship Troopers)|Arachnids]] has a sheet of paper with a copy of the map-board on which he plots out his bug-hive and tunnel system. The [[Mobile Infantry (Starship Troopers)|Mobile Infantry]] player sends in his soldiers and tries to dig them out. A third faction, the [[Skinnies]], starts out playing on the bug side, but switches to the human side during later scenarios.

In a 1977 review of the original (1976) Avalon Hill game, Martin Easterbrook stated that &amp;quot;All in all this is probably the best SF game currently on the market because it has the well worked out background of Heinlein&amp;apos;s novel and because it is an extrapolation of current military technology, allowing Avalon Hill to use their experience in game design&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;WD&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; and gave the game an overall 9/10 rating.

==Scenarios==
The scenarios for the game were used to recreate the battles described in the novel in a realistic way. The game is broken down into seven different scenarios, and the scenarios are designed so that the game rules are introduced a few at a time as the scenarios progress&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;WD&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; (but can then all be played using the full set of rules).

1. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Feint against the humanoids&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: A single squad of Rasczak&amp;apos;s Roughnecks hits a Skinny colony.

2. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Operation Bughouse&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: A complete platoon takes on an Arachnid hive.

3. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Invasion of Skinny-5&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: A platoon&amp;apos;s attack on a Skinny industrial center.

4. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Revolt!:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; The Skinnies change sides and attack the Arachnids with the help of the Mobile Infantry.

5. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sheol&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (two parts) - &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Operation Corkscrew&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: The combat engineers enter the battle and - &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Retreat and Evacuation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: A group of wounded M.I. are rescued.

6. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Operation Royalty&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: A reinforced platoon takes on two Arachnids complexes to capture a Brain Bug.

7. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Klendathu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: Two platoons vs. two Arachnids complexes in a fight to free human prisoners of war.
