        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Steelman language requirements&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were a set of requirements which a high-level general-purpose [[programming language]] should meet, created by the [[United States Department of Defense]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Department of Defense Common High Order Language program&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1978. The predecessors of this document were called, in order, &amp;quot;[[Straw man proposal|Strawman]]&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Woodenman&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Tinman&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ironman&amp;quot;.

The requirements focused on the needs of [[embedded systems|embedded]] computer applications, and emphasised reliability, maintainability, and efficiency. Notably, they included [[exception handling]] facilities, [[run-time error checking]], and [[parallel computing]].

It was concluded that no existing language met these criteria to a sufficient extent, so a contest was called to create a language that would be closer to fulfilling them. The design that won this contest became the [[Ada (programming language)|Ada programming language]].

The resulting language followed the Steelman requirements closely, though not exactly. It included support for [[generic programming]] as a significant extension not envisaged in the requirements.

The Ada 95 revision of the language went beyond the Steelman requirements, targeting general-purpose systems in addition to embedded ones, and adding features supporting [[object-oriented programming]].
