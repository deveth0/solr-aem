The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Studen Kladenets Reservoir&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (язовир „Студен кладенец“) is the second largest [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] in [[Bulgaria]]. It is situated on the river [[Arda (Maritsa)|Arda]], and is created behind the Studen Kladenets dam, 30 km south-east of the town of Kardzhali. There are another two dams of the Arda - [[Kardzhali Dam]] to the west (upstream) and [[Ivaylovgrad Dam]] to the east (downstream).

The reservoir has a total volume of 489 million m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; and a [[drainage basin]] of 3,706 km² and is 29 km long. It is situated at an average 227 m above sea level, its dam being 338 m long and 67.5 m high. The top of the dam consists of nine spillways, each one being 10.5 by 5 m.
&amp;quot;Studen Kladenets&amp;quot; Hydroelectric Power Plant is situated appr. 1 km downstream of the dam. The HPP has four [[Francis turbine|Francis-type turbines]], 15 MW each. There is undergoing project for reconstruction and upgrading the HPP with another 16 MW turbine and a smaller eco-turbine and after the completion of the project the total output will reach 85 MW with annual production of 165 GWh of electricity.

Studen Kladenets reservoir is an attractive place for [[fishing|fishermen]], where [[rudd]] is caught in great numbers. Studen Kladenets is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] for &amp;quot;a cold well&amp;quot;.

==History==
The initial plans for the construction of a dam on the Arda date to as early as 1948. Construction began in 1955 and was completed in 1957. The HPP started production in 1958.
