&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Steamboat Geyser&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in [[Yellowstone National Park]]&amp;apos;s [[Norris Geyser Basin]], is the world&amp;apos;s tallest currently-active [[geyser]]. During major eruptions, water may be thrown more than 300 feet (90 m) into the air.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |first=T. Scott |last=Bryan |month=May |year=1995 |title=The Geysers of Yellowstone |edition=3rd Edition |publisher=University Press of Colorado |isbn=0-87081-365-X}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Steamboat&amp;apos;s major eruptions last from 3 to 40 minutes in length, and are followed by powerful jets of steam. Steamboat does not erupt on a predictable schedule with recorded intervals between major eruptions ranging from four days to fifty years.  The geyser was dormant from 1911 to 1961. Minor eruptions of 10 to 15 feet (3â€“5 m) are much more frequent. After an eruption the geyser often vents large amounts of steam for up to 48 hours.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/photosmultimedia/norris-tour-steamboat-geyser.htm |title=Steamboat Geyser |publisher=National Park Service}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Cistern Spring, located nearby, will drain completely during a major eruption of the geyser; the spring refills within a few days.

Prior to 1904, [[Waimangu Geyser]], in New Zealand, had some taller eruptions capable of reaching {{convert|1600|ft}} but in 1904 a [[landslide]] changed the local water table and since then Waimangu has not erupted.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Gregory L. |url=http://www.wyojones.com/tall.htm |title=Tall Geysers |publisher=WyoJones&amp;apos; Geyser Pages |accessdate=May 24, 2006}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Excelsior Geyser]] in Yellowstone&amp;apos;s [[Geothermal areas of Yellowstone#Upper Geyser Basin|Midway Geyser Basin]] likewise was taller, with eruptions reaching {{convert|300|ft}}. However, Excelsior has not erupted since 1985,&amp;lt;ref name=GOSA&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://geyserstudy.org/geyser.aspx?pGeyserNo=EXCELSIOR |title=Excelsior Geyser |publisher=Geyser Observation and Study Association (GOSA)}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and is now classified as a hot spring.

The last eruption of Steamboat Geyser occurred on May 23, 2005.  The last eight major eruptions were on:&amp;lt;ref name=steamboat&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Steamboat Geyser Tallest Active Geyser in the World|url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/upload/255-8-10.pdf|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2013-02-24|format=PDF|year=August 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Steamboat Geyser has two vents, a northern and a southern, approximately five meters apart.
