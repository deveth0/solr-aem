A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;stun belt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a belt that is fastened around the subject&amp;apos;s waist, leg, or arm that carries a battery and control pack, and contains features to stop the subject from unfastening or removing it. A remote-control signal is sent to tell the control pack to give the subject an electric shock. Some models are activated by the subject&amp;apos;s movement.

These devices are used to control [[incarceration in the United States|prisoners in the United States]]. One type is the REACT belt (see below). Some stun belts can restrain the subject&amp;apos;s hands and have a strap going under the subject&amp;apos;s groin to stop him from rotating the belt around the subject&amp;apos;s waist and trying to deactivate it. Stun belts are not generally available to the public.

==REACT belt==
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Remote Electronically Activated Control Technology belt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a make of stun belt. It is a restraining device that applies [[volt|50&amp;amp;nbsp;kV]] to the muscles in the area of the [[kidney]]s, pulsed over [[second|8 seconds]]. It is a product of [[Stun Tech Incorporated]] of [[Cleveland, Ohio]].  In March 2000, Stun Tech became Electronic Defense Technology, LLC, which later became Stinger Systems, Inc. In the fall of 2010, the assets of Stinger Systems (including the REACT system) were purchased by Karbon Arms.

The REACT belt is no longer available from Stinger systems, having been replaced with a device which attaches to the arm or leg called the Band-It.

Introduced in the [[United States|USA]] in the early &amp;apos;90s, by 1996 it was reportedly in use by the [[Bureau of Prisons|US Bureau of Prisons]], the [[US Marshals Service]], and 16 state correctional agencies including those of [[Alaska]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Delaware]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kansas]], [[Ohio]], [[Virginia]], and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. It is also used during judicial hearings (e.g. in 1998, against [[Ronald Hawkins]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] for frequently interrupting Judge [[Joan Comparet-Cassani]] at a sentencing hearing).

In 1996 [[Amnesty International]] called on the USA to ban the use and export of the machine, arguing that it is a [[torture device]] that is &amp;quot;in direct contravention of international standards on the treatment of prisoners&amp;quot;.
