&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stord&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in the [[counties of Norway|county]] of [[Hordaland]], Norway. Stord is sometimes called &amp;quot;Norway in miniature&amp;quot; - as it has such a variety of landscapes: coastline, fjords, forests, agricultural land, and mountain areas.

Stord is located on the [[Stord (island)|island of the same name]], of which the northern part is included in [[Fitjar]] municipality. In addition to the southern part of the Stord island, the municipality includes the islands of [[Huglo]], [[Storsøya]] and [[Føyno]]. The main population centres in Stord are [[Leirvik]] and [[Sagvåg]]. Stord has the highest population in the district of [[Sunnhordland]], and was declared a city in 1997.

==History==
The battle of Stord was fought on or by this island between the Norwegian king [[Haakon I of Norway|Hakon Haraldsson]] and the Danish king [[Harald Bluetooth|Harald &amp;quot;Bluetooth&amp;quot; Gormsson]], supported by Hakon&amp;apos;s brother&amp;apos;s sons led by Harald &amp;quot;Greycloak&amp;quot; Eiriksson. The parish of Stordøen was established as a municipality January 1, 1838 (see [[formannskapsdistrikt]]). [[Fitjar]] was separated from Stord in 1860, and [[Valestrand]] in 1868.

===Name===
The municipality is named after the main island of Stord ([[Old Norse]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Storð&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).  The name is old and was and still is used in [[Iceland]]ic literature meaning ground or earth.  Before 1889, the name was written &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;Stordøen&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

===Coat-of-arms===
The [[Coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] is from modern times.  They were granted on 19 June 1987.  The arms shows a yellow twig of [[holly]] on a red field.  The designer was Truls Nygaard.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.us/flags/no-12-21.html|date=28 June 2002|title=Kommunevåpen|publisher=[http://www.fotw.us Flags of the World]|accessdate=21 September 2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Economy==
The 3 largest private employers in Stord, [[Kværner|Kværner Stord AS]], [[Wärtsilä|Wärtsilä Norway AS]] and Apply Leirvik AS, employ more than 3000 people.

[[Aker Solutions|Aker Stord]], situated south of Leirvik, is the largest yard in Norway. Aker Stord has built the biggest oil production platforms in the world, [[Gullfaks oil field|Gullfaks C]] and [[Troll oil field|Troll]].
