        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;state senator&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a member of a state&amp;apos;s [[Senate]], the [[upper house]] in the [[bicameral]] legislature of 49 [[U.S. state]]s, or a legislator in [[Nebraska]]&amp;apos;s [[unicameral|one house]] [[Nebraska Legislature|State Legislature]].

There are typically fewer state senators than there are members of a state&amp;apos;s [[lower house]].  In the past, this meant that senators represented various geographic regions within a state, regardless of the population, as a way of balancing the power of the lower house, which was apportioned according to population. This changed in 1963 when the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that state legislatures must apportion seats in both houses according to population. A state senator&amp;apos;s job is to represent the people at a higher level than a State Representative.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;See &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Gray v. Sanders]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 372 U.S. 368 (1963)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
