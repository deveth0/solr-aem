&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stornoway Airport&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{Airport codes|SYY|EGPO}} is  an airfield located {{Convert|2|NM|abbr=on|lk=in}} east of the [[town]] of [[Stornoway, Outer Hebrides|Stornoway]]&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;aip&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; on the Isle of [[Lewis]], in [[Scotland]]. The [[Royal Air Force]] maintained an [[RAF Stornoway|RAF airbase]] at the site of the [[airport]] until 1998.

Stornoway Airport is owned by [[Highlands and Islands Airports Limited|HIAL]], a company controlled by the [[Scottish Government]]. The airfield was first opened in 1937, and used mainly for military purposes. [[NATO]] aircraft used the airport for missions over the [[North Atlantic]] and for stop overs to [[Greenland]] and the [[United States]].

Nowadays the airfield is mainly used for domestic passenger services.  The [[Royal Mail]] also operates a daily mail flight. [[CHC Helicopters]] operate 2 [[Sikorsky S-92]] helicopters, registration G-CGMU &amp;amp; G-SARB, equipped for search and rescue on behalf of [[Her Majesty&amp;apos;s Coastguard|HM Coastguard]]. The helicopter crews have flown on over 3,100 callouts since the establishment of the service in May 1987.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Maritime Coastguard Agency, 2006&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [http://mcanet.mcga.gov.uk/public/news/printer.asp?mcga_news_id=102 Stornoway Coastguard Helicopter Passes 2o00 Missions]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; There are also several privately owned light aircraft based at the airport.

Stornoway Airport was also the location of an emergency landing made by an American Airlines Boeing twin-engined 767 jet, on its way from Sweden to Chicago in 1981, due to a medical emergency on board. It stayed at the airport for 2 days.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
