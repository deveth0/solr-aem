&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stendhal syndrome&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stendhal&amp;apos;s syndrome&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hyperkulturemia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Florence syndrome&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[psychosomatic]] disorder that causes rapid heartbeat, dizziness, fainting, confusion and even [[hallucination]]s when an individual is exposed to [[art]], usually when the art is particularly beautiful or a large amount of art is in a single place. The term can also be used to describe a similar reaction to a surfeit of choice in other circumstances, e.g. when confronted with immense beauty in the natural world.

==History==
[[File:Stendhal.jpg|thumb|upright|The Stendhal syndrome was named after Henri-Marie Beyle (January 23, 1783 â€“ March 23, 1842), better known by his penname Stendhal]]
The illness is named after the famous 19th-century French author [[Stendhal]] (pseudonym of Henri-Marie Beyle), who described his experience with the phenomenon during his 1817 visit to [[Florence]] in his book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Naples and Florence: A Journey from Milan to Reggio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

When he visited the [[Basilica of Santa Croce]], where [[Machiavelli]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Galileo]] are buried, he saw [[Giotto]]&amp;apos;s ceiling frescoes for the first time and was overcome with emotion. He wrote &amp;quot;I was in a sort of ecstasy, from the idea of being in Florence, close to the great men whose tombs I had seen. Absorbed in the contemplation of sublime beauty... I reached the point where one encounters celestial sensations... Everything spoke so vividly to my soul. Ah, if I could only forget. I had palpitations of the heart, what in Berlin they call &amp;apos;nerves.&amp;apos; Life was drained from me. I walked with the fear of falling.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OxyNfsmXfYEC&amp;amp;pg=PA196&amp;amp;dq=%22Absorbed+in+the+contemplation+of+sublime+beauty%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=TlaWUabSE6bP0AWCqYCgDA&amp;amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22Absorbed%20in%20the%20contemplation%20of%20sublime%20beauty%22&amp;amp;f=false &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Interfaces of Performance&amp;apos;&amp;apos;],  Maria Chatzichristodoulou, Janis Jefferies, Rachel Zerihan, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2009 p196 ISBN 9781409486145&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Although there are many descriptions of people becoming dizzy and fainting while taking in Florentine art, especially at the [[Uffizi]], dating from the early 19th century on, the syndrome was only named in 1979, when it was described by Italian psychiatrist [[Graziella Magherini]], who observed and described more than 100 similar cases among tourists and visitors in Florence.
