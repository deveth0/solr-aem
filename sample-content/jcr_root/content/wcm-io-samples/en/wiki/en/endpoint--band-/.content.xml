&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Endpoint&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] band from [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. A considerable number of their songs dealt with social and political issues Prior to becoming known as Endpoint, the band&amp;apos;s original name was Deathwatch. They released only one record, posthumously in 1991, which was a split 7” with another local band named Crain. In 1988, the band changed their name and with most of the original line-up, they released a 17-song album on cassette through the [[Slamdek]] Record Company label. The album, called &amp;quot;If The Spirits Are Willing,&amp;quot; was available in Louisville area stores in May 1989. However, following this release, the band only performed twice for the remainder of the year, and then practically disappeared.

In 1994, the band finally decided to call it quits after a seven-year career. On December 31, the band played their last and largest show for over two thousand people in, of course, Louisville.  In 1995, the band released their last record, appropriately entitled &amp;quot;The Last Record.&amp;quot;
