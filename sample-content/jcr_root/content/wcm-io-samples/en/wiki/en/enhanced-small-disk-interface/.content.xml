&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Enhanced Small Disk Interface (ESDI)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a disk interface designed by [[Maxtor Corporation]] in the early 1980s to be a follow-on to the [[ST-506]] interface. ESDI improved on ST-506 by moving certain parts that were traditionally kept on the controller (such as the [[data separator]]) into the drives themselves, and also generalizing the control bus such that more kinds of devices (such as removable disks and [[tape drive]]s) could be connected. ESDI used the same cabling as ST-506 (one 34-pin common control cable, and a 20-pin data channel cable for each device), and thus could easily be retrofitted to ST-506 applications.

ESDI was popular in the mid-to-late 1980s, when [[SCSI]] and [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]] technologies were young and immature, and ST-506 was neither fast nor flexible enough. ESDI could handle data rates of 10, 15, or 20 Mbit/s (as opposed to ST-506&amp;apos;s top speed of 7.5 Mbit/s), and many high-end SCSI drives of the era were actually high-end ESDI drives with SCSI [[bridge (disambiguation)|bridge]]s integrated on the drive.

By 1990, SCSI had matured enough to handle high data rates and multiple types of drives, and ATA was quickly overtaking ST-506 in the desktop market. These two events made ESDI less and less important over time, and by the mid-1990s, ESDI was no longer in common use.
