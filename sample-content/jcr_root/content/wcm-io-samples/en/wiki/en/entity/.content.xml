An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;entity&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is something that exists by itself, although it need not be of material existence. In particular, [[abstraction]]s and [[legal fiction]]s are usually regarded as entities. In general, there is also no presumption that an entity is [[Life|animate]].

In business, an entity is a person, department, team, corporation, cooperative, partnership, or other group with whom it is possible to conduct business.

Sometimes, the word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;entity&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is used in a general sense of a [[being]], whether or not the referent has material existence, e.g., is often referred to as an entity with no [[Matter|corporeal]] form ([[non-physical entity]]), such as a language. It is also often used to refer to [[ghost]]s and other [[spirit]]s.

The word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;entitative&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the adjective form of the noun entity. Something that is entitative is &amp;quot;considered as pure entity; abstracted from all circumstances&amp;quot;, that is, regarded as entity alone, apart from attendant circumstances.
