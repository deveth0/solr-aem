The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;European NGO Council on Drugs (ENCOD)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a network of [[Europe]]an [[non-governmental organisation]]s and citizens concerned with the impact of current international [[approved drug|drug]] policies on the lives of the most affected sectors in North and South. Since 1994 they have been working to advocate more just and effective drugs control policies, which include an integrated solution for all problems related to the global drugs phenomenon.

==History==
ENCOD was set up in 1993 thanks to the support of the European Commission, as an NGO counterpart to the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction. However, the Management Board of the EMCDDA later decided to ignore any NGO involvement in the work of the EMCDDA. We are a self-financed and completely independent network. The association is legally based in Belgium, and is steered by a Committee of 7 people from different EU countries.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;What is ENCOD ?&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encod.org/info/What-is-ENCOD.html|title=What is ENCOD ?|work=What is ENCOD}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Mission==
ENCOD has three primary objectives:
* To improve understanding of the causes and effects of the drugs trade;
* To contribute to the elaboration of just and effective drugs control policies;
* To bring about greater consistency between drugs control efforts and economic and social policies.

ENCOD is implementing these objectives in three ways:
* it facilitates coordination, information exchange and joint analysis between its members;
* it carries out joint information campaigns, aimed at the general public;
* it carries out joint advocacy activities, aimed at policy-makers and the media.
