==Etymology==
The name is derived from the [[Old English]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Enedford&amp;apos;&amp;apos; meaning &amp;apos;duck ford&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Wiltshire/Enford | title=Enford, Wiltshire | publisher=University of Nottingham | work=Key to English Placenames | accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Local government==
Enford is a [[civil parish]] in the area of the [[Wiltshire Council]] [[unitary authority]], which is responsible for all significant aspects of [[local government]]. It also has an elected [[Parish councils in England|parish council]], with mostly consultative functions.

==Archaeology==
The East Chisenbury [[midden]] is a famous example of a large dump of archaeological material, dating to the 1st millennium BC. Sited on [[Salisbury Plain]], the midden mound contains discrete layers upon layers of flint, charcoal, bones, pottery and excrement. It survives to a height of {{convert|8|ft|m}} and is {{convert|460|ft|m}} wide despite 2,500 years of weathering. The accumulation is believed by some archaeologists to have a ritual basis, with organised deposition of produce and waste being suggested as an explanation for its size and longevity.
