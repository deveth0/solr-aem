An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Environmentally Sensitive Area&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ESA) is a type of designation for an [[agricultural]] area which needs special protection because of its [[landscape]], [[wildlife]] or historical value. The scheme was introduced in 1987.  Originally it was administered by [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]], then the [[Rural Development Service]] for the [[United Kingdom]] [[Government]]s [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], and currently [[Natural England]] following successive re-organisation of the departments. In 2005 the scheme was superseded by [[Environmental Stewardship]] and closed to new entrants. Existing agreements remain active until they expire, meaning the designation will remain active until 2014. this features the protection of the areas.

Farmers entered into a 10-year contract with the government and received an annual payment for the area that is part of the scheme. Farmers were expected to adopt [[environmentally friendly]] agricultural practices.
