It started as a bicycle shop in 1969. It began manufacturing bicycle components in 1974, mostly to make a bicycle look more like a motocross motorcycle, including fenders and false fuel tanks. In 1977 JMC began manufacturing [[bicycle motocross]] (BMX) bicycles.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.jmcbmx.com/about.htm History]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; During the 1970s it sponsored racers in BMX. Riders sponsored by JMC include [[Harry Leary]], [[Clint Miller]], [[Tinker Juarez]], and [[Darrell Young]].

By 1979 the bicycle shop was sold and the company owned just the factory. Sales peaked in 1981 when it was number two of the [[American Bicycle Association]] title for top BMX factory team three years in a row.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;BMX Plus!&amp;apos;&amp;apos; September 1985 Vol.8 No.9 pg.12&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Jim Melton folded the company in July 1985 because, in addition of his wife Vera&amp;apos;s poor heath,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;BMX Plus!&amp;apos;&amp;apos; September 1985 Vol.8 No.9 pg.12&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; he was proud of his bikes being made in America and did not want to move production to Taiwan as others were doing.

==Models==
The JMC Black Shadow was the most desirable of their models with a reputation for light weight and an excellent black finish.
