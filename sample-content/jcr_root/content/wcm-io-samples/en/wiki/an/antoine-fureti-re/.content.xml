&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Antoine Furetière&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (28 December 1619 – 14 May 1688), [[France|French]] scholar and writer, was born in [[Paris]].

==Biography==
He studied law and practised for a time as an advocate, but eventually [[Holy Orders|took orders]] and after various promotions became abbé of [[Chalivoy]] in the [[diocese of Bourges]] in 1662. In his leisure moments he devoted himself to letters, and in virtue of his satires—&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nouvelle Allégorique, ou histoire des derniers troubles arrivés au royaume d&amp;apos;éloquence&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1658) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Voyage de Mercure&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1653)—he was admitted as a member of the [[Académie française]] in 1662. The academy had long promised a complete [[dictionary]] of the French language; and when the members heard that Furetière was on the point of issuing a work of a similar nature, they interfered, alleging that he had purloined from their stores and that they possessed the exclusive privilege of publishing such a book.

After much recrimination on both sides, Furetière was expelled in 1685; but he took revenge in his satire, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Couches de l&amp;apos;académie&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Amsterdam, 1687). His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dictionnaire universel&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was posthumously published in 1690 (Rotterdam, 2 vols.). It was revised and improved by the [[Protestant]] jurist [[Henri Basnage de Beauval]] (1656–1710), who published his edition (3 vols.) in 1701, and it was superseded only by the compilation known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dictionnaire de Trévoux]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Paris, 3 vols., 1704; 7th ed., 5 vols., 1771), a lexicon with which some Jesuits were occasionally affiliated  and that drew heavily from the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dictionnaire universel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Furetière also wrote &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Le Roman bourgeois&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1666), which cast ridicule on the fashionable romances of [[Madeleine de Scudéry]] and of [[Gauthier de Costes, seigneur de la Calprenède]], and described the everyday life of his times, especially the legal profession. Because of its similarity to [[Paul Scarron]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Le Roman comique&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1651, 1657), it was translated into English as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Scarron&amp;apos;s City Romance&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1671. With a self-conscious narrator who comments on his techniques and disregards the conventions of the novel, it anticipates [[Laurence Sterne]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Tristram Shandy]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in many ways. A collected &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fureteriana&amp;apos;&amp;apos; appeared in Paris eight years after his death.
