        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anselm of Laon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (died 1117) was a [[France|French]] [[theology|theologian]] and founder of a school of scholars who helped to pioneer [[biblical hermeneutics]].

Remembered in the century after his death as &amp;quot;Anselmus&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Anselm&amp;quot;, his name was more properly &amp;quot;Ansellus&amp;quot; or, in Modern French, &amp;quot;Anseau.&amp;quot;

Born of very humble parents at [[Laon]] before the middle of the 11th century, he is said to have studied under [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm]] at [[Bec Abbey|Bec]], though this is almost certainly incorrect. Other potential teachers of Anselm have been identified, including [[Bruno of Cologne]] and [[Manegold of Lautenbach]]. By ca. 1080, he had moved back to his place of birth and was teaching at the [[cathedral school]] of Laon, with his brother Ralph. In ca. 1109 he became dean and chancellor of the cathedral, and in 1115 he was one of Laon&amp;apos;s two archdeacons. His school for theology and [[exegesis]] rapidly became the most famous in Europe. Famously, in 1113 he expelled [[Peter Abelard]] from his school.

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Liber Pancrisi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (c. 1120) names him, with [[Ivo of Chartres]] and [[William of Champeaux]], as one of the three modern masters.

== Works ==
Anselm&amp;apos;s greatest work, an interlinear and marginal [[gloss]] on the &amp;apos;Scriptures&amp;apos;, the [[Glossa ordinaria]], now attributed to him and his followers,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |last=Lindberg |first=David |year=1978 |title=Science in the Middle Ages |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0226482324 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was one of the great intellectual achievements of the [[Middle Ages]]. It has been frequently reprinted. The significance of the gloss, which was most likely assembled after Anselm&amp;apos;s death by his students, such as [[Gilbert de la Porrée]], and based on Anselm&amp;apos;s teaching, is that it marked a new way of learning&amp;amp;nbsp;— it represented the birth of efforts to present discrete [[patristic]] and earlier medieval interpretations of individual verses of Scripture in a readily-accessible, easily-referenced way. This theme was subsequently adopted and extended by the likes of [[Hugh of St. Victor]], [[Peter Lombard]] and later [[Thomas Aquinas]], who gave us &amp;apos;handbooks&amp;apos; for what we would now call [[theology]].

Other commentaries apparently by Anselm have been ascribed to various writers, principally to Anselm of Canterbury. A list of them, with notice of Anselm&amp;apos;s life, is contained in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Histoire littéraire de la France]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, x. 170-189.

The works are collected in [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Patrologia Latina]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, tome 162; some unpublished &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sententiae&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were edited by G Lefevre (Milan, 1894), on which see [[Barthélemy Hauréau]] in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Journal des savants]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for 1895. The commentary on the Psalms published by Migne in vol. 116 and attributed to [[Haymo of Halberstadt]] has also been identified as possibly being the work of Anselm.
