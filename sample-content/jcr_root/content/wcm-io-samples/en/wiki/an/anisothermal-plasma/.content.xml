An &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anisothermal plasma&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] which thermal state can be approximated by more than one temperature for the different [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the plasma.
The degrees of freedom refer to translation ([[kinetic energy]]), rotation, vibration of each particle type.

Examples of anisothermal plasmas can be found among low-pressure plasmas that are excited by high frequency [[electric field]]s, see [[frequency classification of plasmas]]. They generally exhibit hot [[electron]]s that are powered by the alternating electric field, and a neutral and [[ion]] component, which is significantly colder due the low efficiency of the energy transfer between light electrons and heavy neutrals and ions.

The term [[nonthermal plasma]] includes anisothermal plasmas and means that the different degrees of freedom of the plasma are &amp;apos;&amp;apos;not&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[thermal equilibrium]].
