The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anatolian Plate&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a continental [[tectonic plate]] consisting primarily of the [[country]] of [[Turkey]].

The easterly side is a boundary with the [[Arabian Plate]], the [[East Anatolian Fault]], a left lateral [[transform fault]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Modeling the contemporary stress field and deformation pattern of eastern Mediterranean|author=Dwivedi S.K., and Hayashi, D., 2010|publisher=Journal of Earth Science Published by Springer |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/7041rg58xg133k47/}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The southerly and southwesterly sides comprise a [[convergent boundary]] with the [[African Plate]], manifest in compressive features of the oceanic crust beneath the [[Mediterranean]] as well as within the [[continental crust]] of [[Anatolia]] itself, and also by what are generally considered to be subduction zones along the [[Hellenic arc|Hellenic]] and [[Cyprus arc]]s.

The northerly side is a [[transform boundary]] with the [[Eurasian Plate]] forming the [[North Anatolian Fault Zone]] (NAFZ).

Research indicates that the Anatolian Plate is rotating counterclockwise as it is being pushed west by the Arabian Plate, impeded from any northerly movement by the Eurasian Plate.

In some references, the Anatolian Plate is referred to as a &amp;quot;block&amp;quot; of continental crust still coupled to the Eurasian Plate.  But studies of the North Anatolian Fault indicate that Anatolia is de-coupled from the Eurasian Plate.  It is now being squeezed by the Arabian Plate from the east and forced toward the west as the Eurasian Plate to its north is blocking motion in that direction.  The African Plate is subducting beneath the Anatolian Plate along the [[Cyprus]] and Hellenic Arcs offshore in the Mediterranean Sea.
