&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anime Unleashed&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[anime]] block that was [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] on the [[United States|American]] [[cable television|cable TV]] [[television network|network]], [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]]. The block was placed on the original [[TechTV]] in early 2003 and moved to [[G4techTV]] after the two networks merged. Titles airing on the block almost exclusively came from domestic anime distributors [[ADV Films]], [[Bandai]] and [[Geneon]] (formerly Pioneer Animation).

==History==
Anime Unleashed was first announced by [[The Screen Savers]] host [[Leo Laporte]] in late 2002. TechTV&amp;apos;s vision was to air a wave of anime series that dealt with technology, futuristic themes, and science fiction. Its premier date was December 30, 2002. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-12-06/tech-tv-anime-unleashed-schedule Tech TV Anime Unleashed Schedule - Anime News Network&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On March 16th, 2006, Anime Unleashed was taken off the G4 schedule. In a commercial aired on G4, promoting the network&amp;apos;s newest additions and changes in late March and April 2006, they contained both a clip of anime and a quick flash of the Anime Unleashed logo, the logo being more visible when watched frame by frame. Despite this, and indications by G4 personnel that the block might have a chance of returning, it never came back on-air after being taken off and was quietly canceled. The broadcast rights to the shows still airing on Anime Unleashed before its cancellation are assumed to have long since expired (and in the case of shows licensed from the now-defunct Geneon, reverted back to the original Japanese licensors or picked up by other companies, such as [[Funimation Entertainment]])

Although unrelated, after about five years of the block&amp;apos;s quiet cancellation, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Marvel Anime]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; made its North American debut on [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]], marking the first time the channel has aired anime since &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anime Unleashed&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, followed by the premiere of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Viper&amp;apos;s Creed]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on October 21.
