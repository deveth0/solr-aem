[[File:Andrew Kippis.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Andrew Kippis, 1792 engraving by [[Francesco Bartolozzi]], after [[William Artaud]]]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Andrew Kippis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (28 March 1725 – 8 October 1795) was an [[English Dissenters|English nonconformist]] clergyman and biographer.

==Life==
The son of Robert Kippis, a silk-hosier, he was born at [[Nottingham]].  Having gone to school at [[Sleaford]] in [[Lincolnshire]] he passed at the age of sixteen to the [[Dissenting academies|Dissenting academy]] at [[Northampton]], of which Dr [[Philip Doddridge]] was then president. In 1746 Kippis became minister of a church at [[Boston, England|Boston]]; in 1750 he moved to [[Dorking, Surrey]]; and in 1753 he became pastor of a [[Presbyterian]] congregation at [[Westminster]], where he remained till his death.

Kippis took a prominent part in the affairs of his church. From 1763 till 1784 he was classical and philological tutor in the [[Coward Trust]]&amp;apos;s academy&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Encyclopædia Americana]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1835, article on Kippis&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; at [[Hoxton]], and subsequently in the [[New College at Hackney]]. In 1778 he was elected a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Antiquarian Society]], and a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1779.

==Works==
Kippis was a voluminous writer. He contributed largely to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Gentleman&amp;apos;s Magazine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Monthly Review (London)|The Monthly Review]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Library&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; and he established the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[New Annual Register]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He published sermons and pamphlets; and he prefixed a life to [[Nathaniel Lardner]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Works&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1788). He wrote a life prefixed to Philip Doddridge&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Exposition of the New Testament&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1792). His major work is his edition of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Biographia Britannica]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; he only lived to publish five volumes (folio, 1778–1793). In this work he had the assistance of [[Joseph Towers]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Notice by [[Abraham Rees]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;New Annual Register&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for 1795.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; minister of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]].

One of the works by Kippis is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cook&amp;apos;s Voyages&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This was first published in London in 1788 &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;See Hocken, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bibliography of New Zealand Literature&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1909&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and includes a letter by Kippis to [[George III of the United Kingdom]] dated 13 June 1788. The book has accounts of the three voyages — [[First voyage of James Cook|1768-1771]], 1772–1775, and 1776-1779 — as well as an account of the character of [[James Cook]], the effects of his voyages, and a commentary on his services.
