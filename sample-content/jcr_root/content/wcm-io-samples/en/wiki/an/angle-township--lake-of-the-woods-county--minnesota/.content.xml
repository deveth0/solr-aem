The population was 119 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;2010 Census (County Subs)&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File - County Subdivision|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST16&amp;amp;prodType=table|work=American FactFinder|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=1 May 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110520154118/http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST16&amp;amp;prodType=table| archivedate= 20 May 2011 &amp;lt;!--DASHBot--&amp;gt;| deadurl= no}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; At 49.22° north latitude, it is the northernmost township in Minnesota and the northernmost point in the contiguous 48 states. (See [[extreme points of the United States]] and [[Northwest Angle]].)

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the township has a total area of 596.3&amp;amp;nbsp;mi&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; (1,544.5&amp;amp;nbsp;km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;); 123.1&amp;amp;nbsp;mi&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; (318.8&amp;amp;nbsp;km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) is land and 473.2&amp;amp;nbsp;mi&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; (1,225.7&amp;amp;nbsp;km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) (79.63%)  water.

The initial establishment of Angle Township being in the United States was due to a map-maker&amp;apos;s error. [[Benjamin Franklin]] and British representatives established the initial U.S. and Canadian borders in the Treaty of Paris in 1783 from a map that mis-represented the source of the Mississippi River. In 1997, in order to change what were considered unequal fishing regulations between the U.S. and Canada, Angle Township resident Gary Dietzler utilized this cartographical mishap to implement a mock secession from the United States, going so far as to get a bill issued by their Congressman [[Collin Peterson]] (D) in the U.S. House of Representatives. The mock secession succeeded in getting fishing regulations better synchronized across these international (fresh) waters.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2011.01-history-the-lost-canadians/ |title=The Lost Canadians |last=Stoddard |first=Grant |publisher=The Walrus |date=January/February 2011 |pages=24–31}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
