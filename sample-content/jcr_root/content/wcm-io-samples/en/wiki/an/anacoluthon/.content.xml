==Examples==
*Had ye been there – for what could that have done? ([[John Milton]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lycidas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)

[[William Shakespeare]] uses anacoluthon in his history plays such as in this (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; IV iii 34-6):
*&amp;quot;Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
*:That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
*:Let him depart.&amp;quot;

Additionally, [[Conrad Aiken]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rimbaud and Verlaine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has an extended anacoluthon as it discusses anacoluthon:
*&amp;quot;Discussing, between moves, [[Iamb (foot)|iamb]] and [[spondee]]
*:Anacoluthon and the open vowel
*:God the great peacock with his [[angel]] peacocks
*:And his dependent peacocks the bright stars...&amp;quot;

==Etymology==
The word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;anacoluthon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[transliteration]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνακόλουθον}} (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;anakólouthon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), which derives from the [[privative]] prefix {{lang|el|ἀν-}} (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;an-&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and the root adjective {{lang|el|ἀκόλουθος}} (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;akólouthos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), &amp;quot;following&amp;quot;. This, incidentally, is precisely the meaning of the Latin phrase &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[logic]].  However, in Classical rhetoric anacoluthon was used &amp;apos;&amp;apos;both&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for the logical error of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;non sequitur&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and for the syntactic effect or error of changing an expected following or completion to a new or improper one.

==Use of the term==

The term &amp;quot;anacoluthon&amp;quot; is used primarily within an academic context.  It is most likely to appear in a study of rhetoric or poetry.  For example &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The King&amp;apos;s English]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, an English [[style guide]] written  by [[H.W. Fowler]] and [[F.G. Fowler]] mentions it as a major grammatical mistake.

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;quot;We can hardly conclude even so desultory a survey of grammatical misdemeanours as this has been without mentioning the most notorious of all. The anacoluthon is a failure to follow on, an unconscious departure from the grammatical scheme with which a sentence was started, the getting switched off, imperceptibly to the writer, very noticeably to his readers, from one syntax track to another.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

The term does occasionally appear in popular media as well.  The word, though not the underlying meaning (see [[malapropism]]), has been popularized, due to its use as an [[:wiktionary:imprecate|imprecation]] by [[Captain Haddock]] in the English translations of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Adventures of Tintin]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; series of books.

*[[Figure of speech]]
*[[Rhetoric]]

Anacoluthon is sometimes (wrongly) confused with [[anacoloutha]], a term that denotes metaphorical substitutions.
