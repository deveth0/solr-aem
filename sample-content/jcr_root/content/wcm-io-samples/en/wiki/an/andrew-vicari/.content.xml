&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Andrew Vicari&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 20 April 1938) is a [[Wales|Welsh]] painter working in France who has established a career painting portraits of the rich and famous. Despite being largely unknown in his own country, {{As of|2004|lc=on}} Vicari was Britain&amp;apos;s richest living painter.

Vicari was born in [[Port Talbot]], [[Wales]], but was evacuated to [[Aberdare]] during the [[World War II]]. He later attended [[Neath Grammar School]] for Boys. Between 1951 and 1953 he studied painting at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]] at [[University College, London]] (UCL) with [[Lucian Freud]] as a teacher. On graduation, Vicari started working in London as a portrait painter. Eschewing modern trends, Vicari has remained a figurative artist working in oil. His work is appreciated worldwide, especially in the [[Middle East]] where three museums are solely dedicated to his work.

In 1974 Vicari was appointed as the official painter to the King and Government of [[Saudi Arabia]]. In the following decades he painted many portraits of the [[House_of_Saud|Saudi royal family]] as well as scenes of [[Riyadh]] and [[Bedouin]] life. It is largely due to this patronage that Vicari owes his financial success. In 2001 he sold a collection of 125 paintings of the [[First Gulf War]] to Prince Khaled for £17 million.

Vicari currently lives and works at his studio outside [[Nice]], [[France]], although he also owns apartments in Riyadh and Monte Carlo.

His fortune was valued at £92 million in 2006 by the [[Sunday Times Rich List]] [http://business.timesonline.co.uk/section/0,,20590,00.html].
