[[General (United Kingdom)|General]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sir Anthony Blaxland Stransham&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Order of the Bath|GCB]] (22 December 1805 â€“ October 1900), was a British military officer.

==Background==
Stransham was the son of Lt. Col. Anthony Stransham of the Royal Marines and grandson of Major Samuel Stransham of the Royal Marines, who planted the British flag on the [[Falkland Islands]], claiming it for [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]].

==Military career==
Stransham entered the [[Royal Marines]] on 1 January 1823. Four years after entering the service, he was present as a [[Subaltern]] at the [[Battle of Navarino]] on 20 October 1827. Stransham led the [[Royal Marines]] during the attack on the City of [[Guangzhou|Canton]] in the [[First Opium War]] in 1841.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=19984|supp=|startpage=1429|date=3 June 1841|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was wounded and was promoted to Captain.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=20071|supp=|startpage=402|date=15 February 1842|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was awarded the [[Baltic Medal]], having been with [[Charles John Napier]] in 1854. From 1862 to 1867, General Stransham was Inspector-General of the Royal Marines.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=23210|supp=|startpage=319|date=16 January 1867|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Later in his career, as a General, the &amp;quot;Grand Old Man of the Army&amp;quot; became a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=26947|supp=|startpage=1681|date=14 March 1898|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He saw active service for over 53 years, retiring with the rank of [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] on 24 December 1875.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=24286|supp=|startpage=256|date=21 January 1876|accessdate=5 April 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
