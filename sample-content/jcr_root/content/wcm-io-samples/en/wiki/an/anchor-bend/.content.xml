The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anchor Bend&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[knot]] used for attaching a rope to a ring or similar termination. Its name originates from the time when &amp;quot;bend&amp;quot; was understood to mean &amp;quot;tie to&amp;quot;, and not restricted to knots that join rope ends.  While the knot can become jammed in some modern materials, it is usually easily untied after moderate loads; it can be made more resistant to jamming by taking an extra turn around the object--this will make for a 1-diameter longer span of the end to reach around the standing part to be tucked (although in a case of tying to a small shackle or link of a chain, this might not be possible). It is the accepted knot for attaching [[anchor]]s (or more usually anchor chains) to [[warping (sailing)|warps]]. The knot is very similar to a [[round turn and two half hitches]] except that the first [[half hitch]] is passed under the turn.  In many everyday uses, the finishing half-hitch need not be made; alternatively, one might seek surer security by tying off the end with a [[Strangle knot]] to the standing part.
