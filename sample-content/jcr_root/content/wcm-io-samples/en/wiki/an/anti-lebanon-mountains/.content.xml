The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anti-Lebanon mountains&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the Western name for the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eastern Lebanon Mountain Range&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Lang-ar|جبال لبنان الشرقية}}), which are a southwest-northeast-trending [[mountain range]] that form the majority of the [[border]] between [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27617/Anti-Lebanon-Mountains Encyclopædia Britannica - Anti-Lebanon Mountains]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The border is largely defined along the crest of the range. The majority of the mountain range lies in [[Syria]].

Its Western name (Anti-Lebanon) comes from the Greek Anti-Libanus, in which the [[prefix]] &amp;quot;anti&amp;quot; means ‘opposite’. The range lies east of and parallel (opposite) to the [[Mount Lebanon]] range.  At its southern end it is also within the [[Golan Heights]]. To the west lie valleys which separate it from the Lebanon range in central Lebanon - the [[Beqaa Valley]] in the north and the [[Hasbani River]] valley in the south. To the east, in Syria, lies the [[Geography of Syria#Eastern plateau|Eastern Plateau]] which contains the city of [[Damascus]].

The Anti-Lebanon range is approximately 150&amp;amp;nbsp;km in length. To the north, it extends to almost the latitude of the Syrian city of [[Homs]]. To the south, the range coalesces with the Golan Heights plateau but includes the highest peaks of [[Mount Hermon]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jabal el-Shaykh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in Arabic), at 2,814 metres, and [[Ta&amp;apos;la&amp;apos;t Musa]], at 2,669 metres. These peaks are snow-covered for much of the year and are located on the Lebanese-Syrian border.
