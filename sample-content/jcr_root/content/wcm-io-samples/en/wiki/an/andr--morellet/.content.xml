&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;André Morellet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (7 March 1727 – 12 January 1819) was a [[France|French]] [[economist]] and writer.  He was one of the last of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[philosophes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and in this character he figures in many memoirs, such as those of [[Madame de Rémusat]].

He was born at [[Lyon]], and educated by the [[Jesuit]]s there, and later at the [[Collège de Sorbonne|Sorbonne]]. He took holy orders, but without much conviction. [[Voltaire]] called him &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;L&amp;apos;Abbé Mords-les&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Father Bite-them&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;), because of his ready and biting wit. His most notable works were a smart pamphlet in answer to [[Charles Palissot]]&amp;apos;s scurrilous play &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Les Philosophes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (which procured him a short stay in the [[Bastille]] for an alleged [[libel]] on Palissot&amp;apos;s patroness, the princesse de Robecq), and a reply to [[Ferdinando Galiani]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Commerce des blés&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1770).

In 1765, Morellet produced a French translation of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[On Crimes and Punishments]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  His translation was widely criticized for the liberties he took with the text.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Beccariadi)1986&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|author1=Cesare Beccaria|title=On Crimes And Punishments|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I_OWHbwVzcEC&amp;amp;pg=PR17|accessdate=21 July 2012|year=1986|publisher=Hackett|isbn=978-0-915145-97-3|page=17}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was a contributor to the [[Encyclopédie]] and a friend of [[Benjamin Franklin]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Isaacson2004&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Isaacson|title=Benjamin Franklin: An American Life|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L64OOJGaCKIC&amp;amp;pg=PA364|accessdate=21 July 2012|date=4 May 2004|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-5807-4|page=364}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Later, he made himself useful in quasi-diplomatic communications with [[England|English]] statesmen, and was pensioned and also elected a member of the [[Académie française]] in 1785. A year before his death in Paris, he brought out four volumes of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mélanges de littérature et de philosophie du XVIII&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;e&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; siècle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, composed chiefly of selections from his former publications, and after his death appeared his valuable &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mémoires sur le XVIII&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;e&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; siècle et la Révolution&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2 vols., 1821).

His semi-satirical translation of [[Nicolau Aymerich]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Directorium Inquisitorum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an influencing factor in the cessation of some of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]&amp;apos;s more [[Inquisition|inquisitorial]] practices.
