The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anglican Province of Christ the King&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;APCK&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[Continuing Anglican movement|Continuing Anglican]] [[Christian Church|church]] with traditional forms both of doctrine and liturgy.  It is considered one of the more [[Anglo-Catholic]] jurisdictions among Continuing Anglican church bodies.

==History==

At the founding of the Continuing Anglican movement in 1977 at the [[Congress of St. Louis]], a proposed constitution for a new Anglican Church in North America was put before the four existing dioceses for ratification. The two which did ratify the constitution later adopted the name [[Anglican Catholic Church]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Duane Alexander|title=A &amp;apos;Continuing&amp;apos; Anglican Congregation: St George&amp;apos;s Church, Las Vegas|journal=Anglican and Episcopal History|year=2011|month=March|volume=80|issue=1|pages=74–78|url=http://nazarethseminary.org/datadir/en-events/ev83/files/miller%20on%20las%20vegas.pdf}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|last=Armentrout|first=Don|title=Episcopal Splinter Groups|journal=Historical Magazine of the Episcopal Church|year=1986|volume=55|pages=295–320}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The two which did not ratify because of concerns that the role of the new church&amp;apos;s bishops was overly narrow, elected to continue under the original name of the movement. One of these non-ratifying dioceses, the Diocese of the Southeastern States, dissolved within a short time leaving only the Diocese of Christ the King under its Bishop Ordinary, the Right Reverend Robert Morse of California.

On June 29, 2007, the Most Reverend James E. Provence was elected as successor to Archbishop Morse upon the latter&amp;apos;s retirement as Archbishop of the Province. Morse continues as Provost of St. Joseph of Arimathea Anglican Theological Seminary which he was instrumental in founding in 1979.

==Name==

A new name, Province of Christ the King, was adopted as the church expanded to become a nationwide jurisdiction spanning the United States.  More recently, the Province became known as the Anglican Province of Christ the King.

==Parishes==

The APCK has over forty parishes across four dioceses organized geographically. Nineteen of its parishes are in California, and its seminary, Saint Joseph of Arimathea Anglican Theological College, is located one block south of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

On 25 July 2007 the bishop and most of the parishes in the Eastern Diocese of the APCK withdrew, joining the [[Anglican Church in America]]. However, four of its parishes decided to remain within the APCK.
