&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Artemius Anastasius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Ἀρτέμιος Ἀναστάσιος Β΄), known in English as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anastasios II&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anastasius II&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (died 719), was the [[Byzantine Emperor]] from 713 to 715.

Anastasios was originally named Artemios (Ἀρτέμιος) and had served as a bureaucrat and Imperial secretary for his predecessors. After the Opsikian army in [[Thrace]] had overthrown Emperor [[Philippikos|Philippicus]], they acclaimed Artemius as Emperor. He chose &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anastasius&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as his regnal name. Soon after his accession, Anastasius II imposed discipline on the army and executed those officers who had been directly involved in the conspiracy against Philippicus.

Anastasios upheld the decisions of the [[Sixth Ecumenical Council]] and deposed the Monothelete [[Patriarch John VI of Constantinople]], replacing him with the orthodox [[Patriarch Germanos I of Constantinople|Patriarch Germanus]] in 715. This also put an end to the short-lived local schism with the [[Catholic Church]].

The invading [[Arab]]s threatened the Empire by land and sea (they penetrated as far as [[Galatia]] in 714), and Anastasios attempted to restore peace by diplomatic means. His emissaries having failed in [[Damascus]], he undertook the restoration of [[Constantinople]]&amp;apos;s walls and the construction of a new fleet. However, the death of the [[Caliph]] [[al-Walid I]] in 715 gave Anastasius an opportunity to turn the tables on the enemy. He had his fleet concentrate on [[Rhodes]] with orders not only to resist the approach of the enemy but to destroy their naval stores, and he dispatched an army under [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo the Isaurian]], afterwards emperor, to invade [[Syria]].

The troops of the Opsikian &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, resenting the Emperor&amp;apos;s strict measures, mutinied, slew the admiral John, and proclaimed as emperor [[Theodosios III|Theodosios]], a tax-collector of low extraction. After a six-month siege, Constantinople was taken by Theodosios; Anastasios, who had fled to [[İznik|Nicaea]], was compelled to submit to the new emperor in 716 and retired to a [[monastery]] in [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]].

In 719, Anastasios headed a revolt against Leo III, who had succeeded Theodosius, receiving considerable support, including auxiliaries reportedly provided by [[Tervel of Bulgaria]]. However the chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]], who offers this information elsewhere, confuses Tervel with his eventual successor [[Kormesiy of Bulgaria|Kormesiy]], so perhaps Anastasios was allied with the younger ruler. In any case, the rebel forces advanced on Constantinople. The enterprise failed, and Anastasios fell into Leo&amp;apos;s hands and was put to death by his orders.
