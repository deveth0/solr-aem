&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ansgar Elde&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1933 – December 4, 2000) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] artist famous for his work in ceramics.

Elde was a member of the [[Situationist International]] (SI). On March 15, 1962 Elde was excluded from the SI along with [[Jørgen Nash]]. Both had been on the central committee and were accused of conspiring with certain art collectors. In fact, they had defended [[Ervin Eisch]], [[Lothar Fischer]], [[Dieter Kunzelmann]], [[Renee Nele]], [[Heimrad Prem]], [[Gretel Stadler]], [[Helmut Sturm]] and [[Hand-Peter Zimmer]] who had been excluded on February 10, 1962. He went on, with Jørgen Nash and others, to work on the [[Second Situationist International]].

Elde collaborated with [[Asger Jorn]] on the large ceramic work made in [[Albisola]], [[Italy]] but transported ro [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]] by train.

In the early nineties [[Heike Arndt]] met Ansgar and accepted his invitation to [[Savona]], [[Italy]], where she developed her work.
