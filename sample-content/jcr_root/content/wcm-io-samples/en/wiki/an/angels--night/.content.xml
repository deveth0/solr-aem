        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Angels&amp;apos; Night&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an event that is designed to mitigate criminal acts associated with [[Devil&amp;apos;s Night]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].
After a brutal Devil&amp;apos;s Night in 1994, then new mayor [[Dennis Archer]] promised city residents arson would not be tolerated.  In 1995, Detroit city officials organized and created Angels&amp;apos; Night on and around October 29â€“31.

Currently as many as 40,000 Detroiters volunteer to keep the city safe on these nights.  Many volunteers keep a high profile patrolling neighborhoods with magnetic-mount flashing [[amber]] beacons, on their personal vehicles, along with communicating with command centers via [[CB radio]]s or by [[mobile phone|cellular phone]]s to report any suspicious activity. In recent years, [[arson]] and other crimes have fallen, much to success of Angels&amp;apos; Night activities and volunteers. The drop in reported fires for the year 2008 has been credited to be because of the Angels&amp;apos; Night program.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.angelsnight.org/ Angels&amp;apos; Night]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Only once has Angels&amp;apos; Night been cancelled since it began.  This cancellation took place in 2005 due to the death of [[Rosa Parks]].  Most Angels&amp;apos; Night and Devil&amp;apos;s Night activities occurred that year in [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] and [[Lansing, Michigan]], as well as in [[Toledo, Ohio]].
