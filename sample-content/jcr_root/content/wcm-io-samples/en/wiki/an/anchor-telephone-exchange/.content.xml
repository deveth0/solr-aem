&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anchor Exchange&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an underground, [[Target hardening|hardened]] [[telephone exchange]] built in [[Birmingham]], [[England]] constructed in the 1950s and opened in September 1957.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Birmingham Anchor Exchange Opened - Ness, A. 1958 The Post Office Telephone Network. Student Quarterly Journal. pp 217-219.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was located nominally on Newhall St.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/sites/b/birmingham_anchor_exchange/index.html|title=Birmingham Anchor Telephone Exchange|last=Ballard|first=Sebastian|date=2003-03-19|work=Subterranea Britannica|accessdate=2008-12-02}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

It originally formed one of a network of 18 Zone Switching Centres within the United Kingdom (UK) that provided trunk switching facilities within its own charge group and to [[Group switching centre|Group Switching Centres]] (GSC) within an area broadly comprising the West Midlands and central Wales. The exchange formed part of the trunk mechanisation plan commenced in 1939&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/btshistory/1912to1968/1939.htm
|title=Trunk Mechanisation Commenced in U.K. Network (1939) |accessdate=8th September 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; to permit operators from originating GSCs to dial through to a distant U.K. subscriber without requiring further operator intervention. Later, it was additionally used to switch subscriber dialled trunk calls after its introduction at Bristol in 1958.

It was subsequently augmented and superseded by a Transit Switching Centre (TSC) equipped with a crossbar switching system ([[TXK#TXK4|TXK4]]) which formed part of the Transit Network. It parented two of the first three GSCs at [[Worcester]] and [[Wolverhampton]] &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/BTsHistory/1969to1980/1971.htm
|title=Transit Network Opened (1971) |accessdate=8th September 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; to go-live when the transit network was inaugurated in 1971 which eventually provided universal U.K. automatic subscriber dialling and was completed in 1979.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/BTsHistory/1969to1980/1979.htm |title=Full UK Subscriber Dialling Completed (1979) |accessdate=8th September 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

It was built together with the [[Guardian Exchange]] in [[Manchester]] and the [[Kingsway Exchange]] in [[London]] to provide [[Target hardening|hardened]] communications in the event of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. In common with most [[civil defence]] structures of the time it was designed to withstand an attack by [[atomic bomb]]s short of a direct hit.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28e35wmElCY|title=Birminghams Nuclear Bunker (1998) |accessdate=9th September 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The exchange took its name from the [[hallmark]] of [[Birmingham Assay Office]], which depicts an [[anchor]].
