&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a state-protected reserve of [[California]], USA, harboring the most consistent blooms of [[California poppy|California poppies]], the state flower.  The reserve is located in the rural westside of [[Antelope Valley]] in northern [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], {{convert|15|mi}} west of [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]].  The reserve is at an elevation ranging from {{convert|2600|to|3000|ft|m}} above [[sea level]] in the [[Mojave Desert]] climate zone. The reserve is administered by the [[California Department of Parks and Recreation]].  Other [[wildflower]]s within the reserve include the [[Castilleja exserta|owl&amp;apos;s clover]], [[Lupinus bicolor|lupin]]e, [[Lasthenia|goldfields]], [[cream cup]]s and [[Coreopsis bigelovii|coreopsis]].

==The reserve==
The intense blooming season for the California poppy falls usually within late winter to early spring, during the months of mid-February through mid-May. Blooming seasons are dependent on the amount of rainfall during the winter to early spring seasons. Within the reserve, there are {{convert|7|mi|km}} of trails, including a paved section for [[wheelchair]] access, which traverse through the poppy fields.

In order to keep the fields in a strictly natural state, California State Parks does not water or stimulate the flowers. The park service also excludes [[sheep]] and [[cattle]] from grazing the hillsides.  Until the early 1970s sheep once grazed the buttes in the western Antelope Valley.  [[Pronghorn]] grazed long before then, until the railroad first arrived in 1876.  With the exception of service [[dogs]], pets are prohibited from the reserve. Under California state law, visitors are also prohibited from taking flowers away from the reserve.

Since 1994, controlled fires are used to regulate dead brush, exotic species and litter within the reserve.

The reserve is located {{convert|7|mi}} east of [[Arthur B. Ripley Desert Woodland State Park]].
