&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ann Carolyn Telnaes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1960 in [[Stockholm, Sweden|Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]) is an  [[editorial cartoonist]]. Unlike many editorial cartoonists, Telnaes does not draw for any one set newspaper, and her cartoons are instead [[print syndication|syndicated]] across the [[United States]]. In 2001, she became the second woman cartoonist to win the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for [[editorial cartoon]]ing.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web| publisher=Library of Congress| title=Pulitzer-prize winning cartoons (Humor&amp;apos;s Edge: Cartoons by Ann Telnaes, Library of Congress)| url=http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/telnaes/telnaes-pulitzer.html| date=2004-06-22| accessdate=2007-06-21| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070628231110/http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/telnaes/telnaes-pulitzer.html| archivedate= 28 June 2007 &amp;lt;!--DASHBot--&amp;gt;| deadurl= no}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; She studied with the Character Animation program at [[California Institute of the Arts]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web| publisher=Population Media Center| title=PMC 2005 Contest| url=http://www.populationmedia.org/cartooncontest/2005/winnersbios.html| year=2004| accessdate=2007-06-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071009040433/http://www.populationmedia.org/cartooncontest/2005/winnersbios.html &amp;lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&amp;gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-09}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Her cartoons tend to be quite [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] in tone and have a special focus on women&amp;apos;s issues, such as [[burka]]s, [[third world]] pregnancy and [[abortion]] rights. A former animator at [[Disney]], her cartoons are easily recognizable for their fluid lines and bright (often spot) colors.

Her animations are featured on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Washington Post]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s website.
