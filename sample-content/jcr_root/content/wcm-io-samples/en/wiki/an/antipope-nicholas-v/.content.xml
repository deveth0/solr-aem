        text="&lt;p&gt;:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Antipope Nicholas V should not be confused with [[Pope Nicholas V]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nicholas V&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pietro Rainalducci&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (c. 1260 – 16 October 1333) was an [[antipope]] in [[Italy]] from 12 May 1328 to 25 July 1330 during the [[pontificate]] of [[Pope John XXII]] (1316–34) at [[Avignon]]. He was the last Imperial antipope, that is, set up by a [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

==Life==
Rainalducci was born at [[Corvaro]], an ancient stronghold near [[Rieti]] in [[Lazio]]. He joined the [[Franciscan]] order after separating from his wife in 1310, and became famous as a [[preacher]].

He was elected through the influence of the [[excommunication|excommunicated]] [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis the Bavarian]], by an assembly of priests and laymen, and consecrated at [[Old St. Peter&amp;apos;s Basilica]], [[Rome]], on 12 May 1328 by the bishop of [[Venice]].

After spending four months in Rome, he withdrew with Louis IV to [[Viterbo]], but in December 1328 the [[papal legate]] [[Giovanni Gaetano Orsini (cardinal)|Cardinal Orsini]] began a campaign against Viterbo and [[Tarquinia|Corneto]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1316.htm#Orsini ORSINI, Giovanni Gaetano (ca. 1285–1335)] at fiu.edu, accessed 5 December 2010&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Nicholas moved on to [[Grosseto]] and then to [[Pisa]], where he was guarded by the imperial [[vicar]]. On 19 February 1329 Nicholas V presided at a bizarre ceremony in the [[Piazza dei Miracoli|Duomo of Pisa]], at which a straw puppet representing [[Pope John XXII]] and dressed in pontifical robes was formally condemned, degraded, and handed over to the secular arm (to be &amp;quot;executed&amp;quot;).

Nicholas V was excommunicated by John XXII in April 1329, and sought refuge with Count [[Boniface of Donoratico]] near [[Piombino]]. Having obtained assurance of pardon, he presented a confession of his sins first to the [[archbishop of Pisa]], and then at [[Avignon]] on 25 August 1330 to John XXII, who absolved him.

He remained in honourable imprisonment in the [[Palais des Papes|papal palace, Avignon]] until his death in October 1333.
