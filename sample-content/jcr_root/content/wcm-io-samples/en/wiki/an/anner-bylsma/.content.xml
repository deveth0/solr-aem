&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anner Bylsma&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anne Bijlsma&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 17 February 1934, [[The Hague]]) is a Dutch [[cello|cellist]] who plays on both modern, and period instruments in  an [[authentic performance|historically informed]] style. He took an interest in music from an early age. He studied with
[[Carel van Leeuwen Boomkamp]] at the [[Royal Conservatory of The Hague]] and won the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Prix d&amp;apos;excellence&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1957.

In 1959, he won the first prize in the [[Pablo Casals]] Competition in [[Mexico]]. Later he was for six years (from 1962 to 1968) the principal cellist in the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]]. He became an [[Erasmus Scholar]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1982. He is the author of the book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bach, the Fencing Master&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a stylistic and aesthetic analysis of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]&amp;apos;s [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Cello Suites]]. He is one of the pioneers of the &amp;apos;Dutch Baroque School&amp;apos; and rose to fame as a partner of [[Frans Brüggen]] and [[Gustav Leonhardt]], who toured extensively together and made many recordings. Bylsma continues to be a towering figure in the baroque cello movement.

In 1979 Bylsma recorded the six Suites for unaccompanied cello (BWV 1007–1012) by J. S. Bach, the first of its kind on a period instrument. He also made a second recording of the same music in 1992 on the large [[Servais Stradivarius]] and on a five-string [[violoncello piccolo]].

Anner Bylsma is married to Dutch violinist Vera Beths.
