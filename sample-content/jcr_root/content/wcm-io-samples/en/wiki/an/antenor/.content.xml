&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Antenor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Ἀντήνωρ) was an [[Athens|Athenian]] sculptor, of the latter part of the 6th century BC. He was named after the [[Greek mythology|mythological]] figure also called [[Antenor (mythology)|Antenor]]. He was the creator of the joint statues of the tyrannicides [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]], set up by the Athenians on the expulsion of [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]]. These statues were carried away by [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] I of [[Persia]] during the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. A basis with the signature of Antenor, son of Eumares, has been shown to belong to one of the dedicated female figures of archaic style which have been found on the [[Acropolis of Athens|acropolis]] of his native [[Polis|city]].
