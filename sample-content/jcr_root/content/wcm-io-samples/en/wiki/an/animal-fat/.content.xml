&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Animal fats and oils&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are [[lipid]] materials derived from [[animals]]. Physically, [[oil]]s are liquid at [[room temperature]], and [[fat]]s are solid.  Chemically, both fats and oils are composed of [[triglycerides]]. Although many animal parts and secretions may yield oil, in commercial practice, oil is extracted primarily from [[Rendering (food processing)|rendered]] tissue [[fat]]s obtained from livestock [[animals]] like [[pigs]], [[chickens]] and [[cows]]. Dairy products also yield popular animal fat and oil products such as [[cheese]], [[butter]], and [[milk]].

Flesh and animal fat have a [[melting point|melting temperature]] of 184&amp;amp;nbsp;°C, a boiling point of around 200&amp;amp;nbsp;°C and an ignition point of 280&amp;amp;nbsp;°C where it will burst into flames without spark. Certain substances such as [[Schmaltz|goose fat]] produce a higher [[smoke point]] than other animal fats, but are still lower than many vegetable oils such as olive or avocado.

In consumer meat products in the U.S., animal remains are found to be classified as Animal fats once the particle size of bone solids is more than 3 percent, protein content is less than 14 percent and or the product contains over 30 percent pure fat content.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citation

Animal fats are commonly consumed as part of a [[western diet]] in their semi-solid form as either [[milk]], [[butter]], [[lard]], [[schmaltz]], and [[dripping]] or more commonly as filler in factory produced meat, [[pet food]] and [[fast-food]] products.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citation

== Culinary uses ==
{{See also|Cooking oil}}

Many animal fats and oils are consumed directly, or indirectly as ingredients in food. The oils serve a number of purposes in this role:
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Shortening&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; – to give pastry a crumbly texture.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Texture&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; – oils can serve to make other ingredients stick together less.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Flavor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; – some may be chosen specifically for the flavor they impart.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Flavor base&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; – oils can also &amp;quot;carry&amp;quot; flavors of other ingredients, since many flavors are present in chemicals that are soluble in oil.

Secondly, oils can be heated, and used to cook other foods. Oils suitable for this purpose must have a high [[flash point]].
