In [[Greek mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anaxarete&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] maiden who refused the advances of a shepherd named [[Iphis]]. His advances were described by Ovid in the following paragraph:

:“Now he would confess his sorry love to her nurse, asking her not to be hard on him, by the hopes she had for her darling. At other times he flattered each of her many attendants, with enticing words, seeking their favourable disposition. Often he gave them messages to carry to her, in the form of fawning letters. Sometimes he hung garlands on her doorpost wet with his tears, and lay with his soft flank on the hard threshold, complaining at the pitiless bolts barring the way.”&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.tonykline.co.uk/PITBR/Latin/Metamorph14.htm#Bkfourteen698 |title=Ovid, The Metamorphoses Bk XIV:698-771 Anaxarete and Iphis |accessdate=2007-08-18 |first=Translation by A.

Anaxarete spurned him and mocked his feelings until he cried in despair and hanged himself on her doorstep. Anaxarete was still unmoved. When she mocked his funeral, calling it pitiful, [[Aphrodite]] turned her into a stone statue.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.tonykline.co.uk/PITBR/Latin/Metamorph14.htm#Bkfourteen698 |title=Ovid, The Metamorphoses Bk XIV:698-771 Anaxarete and Iphis |accessdate=2007-08-18 |first=Translation by A.

A similar tale is told by [[Antoninus Liberalis]], although he names the maiden Arsinoe,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.mythindex.com/greek-mythology/A/Arsinoe.html mythindex.com: Arsinoe]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and her lover [[Arceophon]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.mythindex.com/greek-mythology/A/Arceophon.html mythindex.com: Arceophon]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
