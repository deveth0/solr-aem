&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tubal Uriah &amp;quot;Buzz&amp;quot; Butler&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (21 January 1897 â€“ 20 February 1977), was a [[Grenada|Grenadian]]-born [[Spiritual Baptist]] preacher and labor leader in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. He is best known for leading a series of labor riots between 19 June and 6 July 1937 and for forming a series of personalist political parties (the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;British Empire Citizens&amp;apos; and Workers&amp;apos; Home Rule Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Butler Home Rule Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and finally the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Butler Party]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) that focused its platform on the improvement of the working class.

Butler first came to prominence in 1935 when he led a &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hunger march&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; from the oilfields to [[Port of Spain]]. In 1936 he was expelled from the [[Trinidad Labour Party]] for his &amp;quot;extremist tendencies&amp;quot;. He then formed the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;British Empire Citizens&amp;apos; and Workers&amp;apos; Home Rule Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. On 19 June 1937 a strike in protest of working conditions, wages, racism and exploitation began in the oilfields in the southern Trinidad. Police attempted to arrest Butler as he addressed a meeting in [[Fyzabad]]. His supporters prevented the police from doing so and Charlie King, a police officer was killed. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Labour riots of 1937]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; resulted in turmoil throughout the oilfields. When strikes spread to the [[sugar cane|sugar]] factories, the Colonial government responded by issuing an arrest warrant for Butler. Butler went into hiding and the colonial authorities were unble to locate him. He stayed in contact with the authorities through [[Adrian Cola Rienzi]] and although he was promised safe passage by the colonial authorities to testify at a commission of enquiry into the events of June 1937, he was arrested by the colonial government when he emerged to do so.

Butler was imprisoned from 9 September 1937 to May 1939. With the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September, 1939, Butler was re-arrested and detained for the duration of the war. After release from prison Butler formed the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Butler Home Rule Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which later became the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Butler Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The Butler Party which captured the largest block of seats in the [[Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago|Legislative Council]], but the Governor chose to exclude Butler and instead [[Albert Gomes]] became the first [[Chief Minister]].

In the [[Elections in Trinidad and Tobago#1956 General Elections|1956 General Elections]] the Butler Party only won two seats. Butler, the fiery radical, was deemed too unstable and threatening to the nation&amp;apos;s economic well-being by [[Eric Williams]] and the [[People&amp;apos;s National Movement]].

Butler is looked upon as the founding father of the [[Oilfields Workers&amp;apos; Trade Union]] (OWTU) and the labour movement and is honoured with a statue in Fyzabad. He was awarded the [[Trinity Cross]], the nation&amp;apos;s highest honour, in 1970.
