&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tunstead Milton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] in [[Derbyshire]], [[England]].

It is situated on the [[B5470 road]] west of, and in the parish of, [[Chapel en le Frith]] near the northern edge of the [[Combs, Derbyshire|Combs]] Reservoir.

It is the location of Tunstead Dickey, a &amp;quot;Screaming Skull&amp;quot;, and is mentioned in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Highways and Byways in Derbyshire&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by J B Frith, a guide published in 1905, and in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Black&amp;apos;s Guides|Black&amp;apos;s Guide]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; published throughout the 19th century.

The name Tunstead is likely derived from hundred homestead and Milton from mill town.

The hamlet had in the past a post office, a garage and two public houses, all of which have now closed.

It should not be confused with [[Tunstead, Derbyshire|Tunstead]], which is roughly five miles to the southeast, near [[Wormhill]].
