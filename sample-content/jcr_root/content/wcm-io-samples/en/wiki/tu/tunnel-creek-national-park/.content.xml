&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tunnel Creek National Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[national park]] in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley region]] of [[Western Australia]], {{convert|1845|km}} northeast of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and {{convert|390|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]]. The natural cave through which  [[Tunnel Creek]] flows is a major attraction of the park.

Many aboriginal [[rock painting]]s and [[speleothem]]s are present in the cave decorating the walls. The cave was the hideout of the [[Indigenous Australian|aboriginal]] [[warrior]], [[Jandamarra]] who was killed outside the entrance of the cave in 1897.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.showcaves.com/english/au/caves/TunnelCreek.html|title=Caves of Australia - Tunnel Creek National Park - Cave of Bats|year=2009|accessdate=19 February 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Geography==
The park is located in the [[Napier Range]] and covers an area of {{convert|91|ha|acre}}. The range is composed of [[limestone]] and is the remains of a [[Devonian]] [[reef]] system formed around 350 million years ago.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/component/option,com_hotproperty/task,view/id,44/|title=Department of Environment and Conservation - Parkfinder - Tunnel Creek National Park|year=2009|accessdate=26 September 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The [[tunnel]] component of Tunnel Creek has a length of approximately {{convert|750|m|abbr=on}} that runs underground and it one of the oldest cave systems in Western Australia.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kimberleyaustralia.com/tunnel-creek-national-park.html |title=Kimberley Australia - Tunnel Creek National Park|year=2009|accessdate=19 February 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The reef was first exposed around 250 million years ago and the first cave systems began to form, the present cave systems were created about 20 million years ago.

The cave reaches a maximum height of {{convert|12|m|abbr=on}} and has a maximum width of {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}}. The creek was once known as &amp;quot;The Cave of the Bats&amp;quot; with at least five species of [[bat]] inhabiting the cavern. There are large pools of water on the floor of the cave in which [[freshwater crocodile]]s have been found. The pools indicate that the [[water table]] is only just below the present floor surface and water only flows through the area after heavy rainfall.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agfg.com.au/guide/wa/kimberley/kimberley/derby/attractions-tourism/tunnel-creek-national-park|title=Australian Good Food and Travel Guide - Tunnel Creek National Park|year=2009|accessdate=19 February 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
