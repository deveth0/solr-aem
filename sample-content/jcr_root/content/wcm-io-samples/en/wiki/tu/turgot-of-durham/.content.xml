        text="&lt;p&gt;{{for|the French economist and statesmen|Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thorgaut&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Turgot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (sometimes, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thurgot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was [[Archdeacon]] and [[Prior of Durham]], and the first [[Anglo-Saxons|English]] or [[Anglo-Norman]] [[Bishop of St Andrews|Bishop of Saint Andrews]] (then called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cell Ríghmonaidh&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kilrymont&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

Fleeing the Normans, Turgot became the teacher of [[Olaf Kyrre]] in Norway for a time before returning to be made [[prior]] of the [[Benedictine]] convent of [[Durham Cathedral]], and he may have been the [[confessor]] of [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret of Wessex]], the second wife of [[Máel Coluim mac Donnchada]], [[king of the Scots]], and hence probably known to King [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] and Earl David (later [[David I of Scotland|David I]]) since childhood. Turgot may have been the author of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Vita Sancte Margarete]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the hagiographical life of the queen, which was written for [[Matilda of Scotland]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | title=The Life Of St Margaret, Queen Of Scotland | accessdate=14 March 2011 | url=http://mw.mcmaster.ca/scriptorium/margaret.html}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

According to [[Symeon of Durham]], he was elected to the Bishopric in 1107. Two years later, he was consecrated by [[Thomas II of York|Thomas II]], [[Archbishop of York]]. Turgot died at Durham on 31 August 1115.
