&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Upper schools&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; tend to be schools within [[secondary education]]. Outside England, the term normally refers to a section of a larger school. There is some variation in the use of the term in England.

==England==
===State-maintained schools===

Upper schools are a type of [[secondary school]] found in a minority of English local education authorities. Whilst most areas in [[England]] use a two-tier educational system – [[Primary School|primary]] (ages 5–11) and [[Secondary School|secondary]] (ages 11–16 or 11–18 if they operate a sixth form) – counties such as [[Suffolk]], [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Northumberland]] use a [[three-tier education|three-tier]] system of [[Lower School|lower]] (ages 5–9), [[Middle School|middle]] (ages 9–13), and Upper schools (ages 13–16 or 18 if there is a sixth form).
The introduction of such systems began in [[West Yorkshire]] in the 1963, but has gradually been withdrawn in most areas since the introduction of the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. This is because of the nature of the curriculum, which is divided into [[Key Stage]]s which do not fully align with the three-tier system. In some areas where this type of school is in use, they are known as [[high school]]s.

In [[Buckinghamshire]], which retains the [[eleven plus]], the term is used for secondary schools which admit applicants without reference to the test (elsewhere called [[secondary modern schools]]).

===Independent schools===
Some independent schools use the term upper school to describe departments of a larger school, which may also include [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory]] or junior departments. It is not particularly widely used, and there is little consistency in the way in which the term is applied to refer to year groups.

&amp;quot;

==United States==
Many independent and even some parochial schools in the United States also tend to favor the term &amp;quot;upper school&amp;quot; to designate grades 9–12. Schools favoring this terminology may use &amp;quot;[[middle school]]&amp;quot; for grades 6/7–8/9, &amp;quot;lower school&amp;quot; for grades 1–5, and &amp;quot;[[Early childhood education|early childhood]]&amp;quot; (education) for pre-K through Kindergarten.
