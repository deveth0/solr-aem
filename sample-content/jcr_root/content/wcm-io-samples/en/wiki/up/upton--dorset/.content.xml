&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Upton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a village in south east [[Dorset]], [[England]]. It is the second largest village in [[Purbeck (district)|Purbeck]] and is the gateway to Purbeck.
==Geography==
The village is built around a road junction where the [[Blandford]] to [[Hamworthy]] road crosses the main [[Poole]] to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] road. The Poole suburbs of Hamworthy and [[Turlin Moor]] adjoin the village to the south, whilst [[Lytchett Minster]] is to the west. An area of heathland, Upton Heath, is situated to the north of the village and is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI). Additionally there are Upton Woods, as well as Lytchett Heath and Lytchett Bay, which leads onto [[Poole Harbour]]. Although mostly residential, Upton features a small [[industrial estate]] with businesses including Southern Print. Close to Upton lies [[Upton House, Dorset|Upton House]], a [[country park]] and former Upton Estate. In 2000, The Upton Clock Tower was built at the Upton Crossroads to celebrate the new [[millennium]] and represent the village&amp;apos;s pride.

==Governance==
Upton forms part of the [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of [[Lytchett Minster and Upton]], which in turn forms part of the [[Purbeck (district)|Purbeck]] [[Non-metropolitan district|local government district]] of [[Dorset]]. It is within the [[Mid Dorset and North Poole (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Dorset and North Poole]] constituency of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England]] constituency of the [[European Parliament]].&amp;lt;ref name = mapdat&amp;gt;{{cite book | title = OS Explorer Map OL15 - Purbeck &amp;amp; South Dorset | publisher = [[Ordnance Survey]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-319-23865-3 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
