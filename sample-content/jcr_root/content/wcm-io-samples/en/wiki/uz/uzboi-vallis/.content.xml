&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Uzboi Vallis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[vallis|valley]] lying situated within the [[Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle]] (MC-19) region on [[Mars]]. It is named after a [[Uzboy River|dry river]] valley in [[USSR]], now in [[Turkmenistan]].

The [[valley]] begins on the northern rim of the [[Argyre Planitia|Argyre basin]], and cuts through several [[Impact crater|crater]]s, before ending at [[Holden (crater on Mars)|Holden crater]].

Uzboi Vallis is believed to have been formed by running water.  It is believed that layers were formed on the floor of Uzboi Vallis (as shown in the [[HiRISE]] image below) when drainage was blocked by the impact that formed [[Holden (Martian crater)|Holden Crater]] to the north.  Eventually the lake in the area of Uzboi Vallis went high enough to overtop the rim of Holden.  The water then eroded the deposits to expose the layers as they are today.  The sediments that make up the layers appear to be coarse in size, suggesting they were probably formed by a rapid flow.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008338_1525&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

It has been suggested that Uzboi, [[Ladon Valles|Ladon]], Margaritifer and [[Ares Vallis|Ares]] Valles, although now separated by large craters, once comprised a single [[outflow channel]] flowing north into [[Chryse Planitia]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Parker, T.J., Clifford, S.m., and Banerdt, W.B. (2000). Argyre Planitia and the Mars global hydrologic cycle. LPSC XXXI, Abstract 2033.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The source of this outflow has been suggested as overflow from the [[Argyre]] crater, formerly filled to the brim as a [[lake]] by channels (Surius, Dzigai, and Palacopus Valles) draining down from the south pole. If real, the full length of this drainage system would be over 8000&amp;amp;nbsp;km, the longest known drainage path in the solar system.
