&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hannelore Kohl&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (7 March 1933, [[Berlin]] &amp;amp;ndash; 5 July 2001) was the wife of former [[Germany|German]] [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]]. She met him for the first time at a prom in [[Ludwigshafen]], [[Germany]], when she was 15 years old.

She was born in [[Berlin]] and was christened &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Johanna Klara Eleonore Renner&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Her father was Wilhelm Renner, who headed the employment office at [[HASAG]] that developed the successful one-man anti-tank weapon, the [[Panzerfaust]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.conne-island.de/nf/107/21.html Nazi history in Leipzig] conne-island.de Retrieved March 23, 2010 {{de icon}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Later, she chose the portmanteau &amp;quot;Hannelore&amp;quot; to be used as her first name.

In the days following Germany&amp;apos;s defeat in [[World War II]], at the age of 12, Hannelore Kohl was [[Rape during the occupation of Germany|raped]] by [[Red Army]] soldiers and subsequently “thrown out of a window like a sack of potatoes by the Russians.”&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2005190/Wife-ex-German-chancellor-Helmut-Kohl-raped-age-12-Russian-soldiers.html Wife of ex-German chancellor Helmut Kohl &amp;apos;raped at the age of 12 by Russian soldiers&amp;apos;], [[Daily Mail]], June 18, 2011&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2011/06/20/hannelore-kohl-wife-of-former-german-chancellor-was-raped-by-russian-troops-115875-23212991/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/01/the-wartime-toll-on-germany/2661/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In addition to the obvious psychological impact, the attacks left her with a fractured vertebra and back pain for the rest of her life.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-11/kohl-s-wife-suffered-war-rape-trauma-life-in-his-big-shadow-german-books.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Catherine | last=Hickley | title=Kohl&amp;apos;s Wife Suffered War Rape Trauma, Life in His Large Shadow | date=July 11, 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  In order to help others with similar injuries, in 1983 she  founded the Kuratorium ZNS, a foundation that helps those with trauma-induced injuries to the [[central nervous system]], and became its president.

On 5 July 2001, Kohl was found dead at age 68 in her [[Ludwigshafen]] home. She had apparently committed [[suicide]] with an overdose of sleeping pills, after years of suffering from what she had claimed to be a very rare and painful [[photo allergy]] induced by an earlier [[penicillin]] treatment that had forced her to avoid practically all sunlight for years.  In 2005, the Kuratorium ZNS was renamed ZNS - Hannelore Kohl Stiftung in her honor.

However, journalist [[Andrew Gimson]], writing in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Spectator]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.spectator.co.uk/print/politics/all/9161/married-to-a-monster.thtml &amp;quot;Married to a monster&amp;quot;], [[The Spectator]], 28 July  2001&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; cast doubt upon the official version of events. Similar questions were also raised by the German newsmagazine &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the [[BBC]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1436219.stm &amp;quot;German media split by suicide&amp;quot;] [[BBC]] (12 July 2001). Retrieved 23 March 2011&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Kohl&amp;apos;s collection of German-style cooking recipes, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kulinarische Reise durch Deutsche Länder&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Culinary Journey through German Regions&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), was published in 1996.
