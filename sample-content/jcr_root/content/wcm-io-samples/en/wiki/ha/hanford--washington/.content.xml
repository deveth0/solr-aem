{{for|the nuclear site|Hanford Site}}

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hanford&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a small agricultural community in [[Benton County, Washington]], [[United States]]. It was depopulated in 1943 along with the town of [[White Bluffs, Washington|White Bluffs]] in order to make room for the nuclear production facility known as the [[Hanford Site]]. The town was located in what is now the &amp;quot;100F&amp;quot; sector of the site.

The original town, named for the judge and irrigation company president [[Cornelius Hanford]],&amp;lt;ref name=majors&amp;gt;{{Cite book| last = Majors | first = Harry M. | title = Exploring Washington | publisher = Van Winkle Publishing Co | year = 1975 | page = 134 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CoWrPQAACAAJ| isbn = 978-0-918664-00-6}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was settled in 1907 on land bought by the local power and water utility. In 1913, the town had a spur railroad link to the transcontinental [[Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway]], also known as &amp;apos;the electric railroad.&amp;apos; By 1925 the town was booming thanks to high agricultural demand, and it boasted a hotel, bank, and its own elementary and high schools.

The town was [[eminent domain|condemned]] by the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] to make way for the Hanford site.  Residents were given a thirty day eviction notice on March 9, 1943.&amp;lt;ref name=majors/&amp;gt;  Most buildings were destroyed, with the notable exception of the high school. It was used during WWII as the construction management office.  The school still stands today, marred by its use during the years for [[SWAT]] practice, and can be seen from the Hanford tour bus operated by the U.S. government.
