&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Conscience of a Hacker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Hacker Manifesto&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a small essay written January 8, 1986 by a [[Hacker (computer security)|computer security hacker]] who went by the handle (or [[pseudonym]]) of The Mentor (born [[Loyd Blankenship]]). It was written after the author&amp;apos;s arrest, and first published in the [[underground ezine|underground hacker ezine]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Phrack]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in Volume One, Issue 7, [[Phile]] 3 of 10. It can be found on many websites, as well as on t-shirts and in films.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=Hacker Culture |first=Douglas |last=Thomas |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8166-3346-3 |pages=xxiv }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

It is considered a cornerstone of hacker culture, and it gives some insight into the [[psychology]] of early hackers. It is said to have shaped the hacker community&amp;apos;s view of itself and its motivations. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Manifesto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; states that hackers choose to hack because it is a way for them to learn, and because they are often frustrated and bored by the limitations of standard society. It also expresses the [[satori]] of a hacker realizing his potential in the realm of computers.

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Manifesto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; acts as a guideline to hackers across the globe, especially those new to the field. It serves as an ethical foundation for hacking, and asserts that there is a point to hacking that supersedes selfish desires to exploit or harm other people, and that technology should be used to expand our horizons and try to keep the world [[freedom of information|free]].

== In popular culture ==
The article is quoted several times in the 1995 movie &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hackers (movie)|Hackers]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, although in the movie it is being read from an issue of the hacker magazine &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[2600 The Hacker Quarterly|2600]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, not the historically accurate &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Phrack]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It is also reproduced inside the CD case of the computer game &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Uplink (computer game)|Uplink]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The Mentor gave a reading of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Hacker Manifesto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and offered additional insight at [[H.O.P.E.|H2K2]]. It is also an item in the game [[Culpa Innata]].

&amp;quot;A Hacker Manifesto&amp;quot; is also the name of a book written by [[The New School]] media studies professor [[McKenzie Wark]].

A poster of the Hacker Manifesto is displayed in [[The Social Network]] in Mark Zuckerberg&amp;apos;s dorm room.
