&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Haymarket&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a locality of [[Sydney]]&amp;apos;s city centre, [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It is located at the southern end of the [[Sydney central business district]] in the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of the [[City of Sydney]].

==History==
Sydney&amp;apos;s produce markets were located in Haymarket from the early 20th century through to the 1980s when they were moved to a new site at [[Flemington, New South Wales|Flemington]]. [[Paddy&amp;apos;s Markets]] still operate on part of the site of the vegetable markets as a produce and [[flea market]]. The &amp;apos;Market City&amp;apos; complex contains the markets, [[The Peak Building|The Peak]] apartment building, a modern shopping centre featuring a food court, restaurants, boutiques, specialty shops and [http://www.amusementcity.com.au City Amusements] (Sydney&amp;apos;s largest family fun centre)

The outer walls of the original vegetable market, built in 1909, were preserved and restored as an example of Edwardian architecture. They were part of the original city markets—designed by city architect C.Broderick—which were bounded by Hay Street, Quay Street and Thomas Street. They were built to replace the old Belmore Market, which had failed because it was too far from Darling Harbour.

The new markets included the Sydney City Markets building (Ultimo Road), designed by [[George McRae]] and built in 1910, and the Sydney Markets Bell Tower (Quay Street), built in 1911 and restored by the State Bank in 1985. The bell tower is now incorporated within the [[University of Technology, Sydney]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Sydney Architecture, John Haskell (UNSW Press) 1997, p.55&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
