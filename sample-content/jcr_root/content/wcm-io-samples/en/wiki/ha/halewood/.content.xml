&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Halewood&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is in [[Merseyside]], [[England]] and is located in the Metropolitan Borough of [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]]. The district lies near Liverpool&amp;apos;s southeastern boundary, bordered by the suburbs of [[Hunts Cross]] and [[Woolton]].

Historically a part of [[Lancashire]], at the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]], the population of the [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] was 20,309.&amp;lt;ref name=2001census&amp;gt;{{citation|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=3&amp;amp;b=561276&amp;amp;c=halewood&amp;amp;d=14&amp;amp;e=16&amp;amp;g=357792&amp;amp;i=1001x1003x1004&amp;amp;m=0&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;s=1211831458656&amp;amp;enc=1|title=2001 Census: Halewood|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=26 May 2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The combined population of Halewood&amp;apos;s four local government [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]] was 29,217.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citation|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=3&amp;amp;b=561276&amp;amp;c=halewood&amp;amp;d=14&amp;amp;e=16&amp;amp;g=357792&amp;amp;i=1001x1003x1004&amp;amp;m=0&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;s=1211831458656&amp;amp;enc=1|title=2001 Census: Halewood East (Ward)|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=26 May 2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citation|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=3&amp;amp;b=5941480&amp;amp;c=halewood&amp;amp;d=14&amp;amp;e=16&amp;amp;g=357787&amp;amp;i=1001x1003x1004&amp;amp;m=0&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;s=1211831415062&amp;amp;enc=1|title=2001 Census: Halewood North (Ward)|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=26 May 2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citation|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=3&amp;amp;b=5941479&amp;amp;c=halewood&amp;amp;d=14&amp;amp;e=16&amp;amp;g=357790&amp;amp;i=1001x1003x1004&amp;amp;m=0&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;s=1211831351390&amp;amp;enc=1|title=2001 Census: Halewood South (Ward)|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=26 May 2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citation|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=3&amp;amp;b=5941478&amp;amp;c=halewood&amp;amp;d=14&amp;amp;e=16&amp;amp;g=357791&amp;amp;i=1001x1003x1004&amp;amp;m=0&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;s=1211831010609&amp;amp;enc=1|title=2001 Census: Halewood West (Ward)|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=26 May 2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Halewood railway station]] opened in 1988.

Halewood is home to the [[Jaguar Land Rover]] [[Halewood Body &amp;amp; Assembly|Body &amp;amp; Assembly facility]], which produces the [[Land Rover Freelander]], [[Range Rover Evoque]] and up until Friday 18 December 2009 the [[Jaguar X-Type]]. On the same site is a large factory owned by [[Getrag]] which produces gearboxes for amongst others the [[Ford Transit]], [[Ford Fiesta]] and the [[Land Rover Defender]].

There is also the Dista Factory which produces pharmaceuticals.
[[Everton Football Club]] have built their new training ground and youth academy on the edge of Halewood called [[Finch Farm]]

Parts of Halewood struggle with high levels of crime, anti-social behaviour, unemployment and poor housing. To date, various attempts at regeneration of these areas have been largely unsuccessful, often due to lack of investment. However, there is renewed hope with plans for redeveloping the &amp;quot;Raven Court&amp;quot;  shopping precinct on Leathers Lane now starting to come to fruition after years of planning.

However, other parts of Halewood are much more affluent.  New housing developments such as Bailey&amp;apos;s Reach have created houses in the top range of prices where the old sports centre, Bridgefield Forum was before it was knocked down and replaced with Halewood Sports Centre in a new location. Other estates such as Okell Drive and the estates nearby the original Halewood village are also thriving. The areas largest small business is Alpha Taxis (previously Halewood Taxis) and its largest employer is the [[Jaguar Land Rover]] factory.

[[Steve McMahon (footballer)|Steve McMahon]], the former Everton and [[Liverpool FC]] [[midfielder]], was born in Halewood.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citation|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/past_players/players/mcmahon/ |title=Past Player Profile: Steve McMahon|publisher=Liverpool FC|accessdate=10 May 2007}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Playwright [[Fred Lawless]] spent most of his childhood in Halewood and attended St. Mark&amp;apos;s Primary School in Leathers Lane.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Coronation Street]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Bill]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; actor, [[Andrew Lancel]], lives in Halewood.
