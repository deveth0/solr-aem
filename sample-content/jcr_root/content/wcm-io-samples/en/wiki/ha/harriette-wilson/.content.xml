&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Harriette Wilson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 22, 1786 - March 10, 1845) was a celebrated [[British Regency]] [[courtesan]], whose clients included the Prince of Wales, the Lord Chancellor and four future Prime Ministers.

== Life ==
Harriette Dubouchet was one of the fifteen children of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] John James Dubouchet (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Bouchet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), who kept a small shop in [[Mayfair]], [[England]], and his wife Amelia, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;nÃ©e&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Cook. Her father is said to have assumed the surname of Wilson about 1801. She began her [[career]] at the age of fifteen, becoming the [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] of [[William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven (1770-1825)|William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven, 7th Baron Craven]]. Among her other lovers with whom she had a business arrangement was [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], who commented &amp;quot;publish, and be damned&amp;quot; when informed of her plans to write her memoirs.  Her decision to publish was partly based on the broken promises of her lovers to provide her with an income in her older age. The memoirs are still in print.

Her sisters Amy, Fanny and Sophia also became [[courtesan]]s. Sophia married respectably into the [[Peerage|aristocracy]], when she wed [[Thomas Noel Hill, 2nd Baron Berwick|Lord Berwick]], at 17.
