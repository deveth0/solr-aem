&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hawthorn railway station&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is located in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], on the [[Lilydale railway line|Lilydale]], [[Belgrave railway line|Belgrave]], and [[Alamein railway line|Alamein]] lines, at Burwood and Evansdale Roads in the [[suburb]] of [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]]. The [[railway station|station]] is 5.6 kilometres from [[Flinders Street Station]], the centre of the city&amp;apos;s [[List of Melbourne railway stations|suburban railway network]], and in [[myki]] ticketing &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:goldenrod;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Zone 1&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;.

==Station overview==

===Facilities===

Hawthorn consists of a [[side platform]] and an [[island platform|island format]]; Platform 1 has a large weatherboard building, while the island platform has a smaller weatherboard building underneath a large canopy. A footbridge at the Down end of the station connects all three platforms. Hawthorn is an unstaffed station, with only limited facilities.

===History===

Hawthorn opened in 1861 with the opening of the line from Melbourne.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.vicsig.net/index.php?page=infrastructure&amp;amp;name=Hawthorn Hawthorn - VICSIG Infrastructure]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Originally Hawthorn was a terminus with a single platform, now designated as platform 1. In 1882 an additional platform was constructed after the line was extended to [[Camberwell railway station, Melbourne|Camberwell]]. In 1890 an island platform was constructed using a canopy from the original Flinders Street Station for then new, now closed, [[Kew railway line|branch line to Kew]]. The two island platforms, numbered 2 and 3, are still used, although few services stop on platform 3 except during [[rush hour|peak hour]].

A third track was added between Hawthorn and [[Burnley railway station|Burnley]] in 1972. This allowed the centre track to be used as a bi-directional track for express services during peak hour and completed triplication of the line as far as [[Box Hill railway station, Melbourne|Box Hill]].

Through the 1970s and 1980s the Victorian railway system in general, and Hawthorn station in particular, were neglected. By the end of the 1980s the station was in a sadly dilapidated state and had not been painted for many years. It has since been fully restored and is listed on the [[Victorian Heritage Register]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite VHD|576|Hawthorn Railway Station complex|hr=1566|ho=42}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
