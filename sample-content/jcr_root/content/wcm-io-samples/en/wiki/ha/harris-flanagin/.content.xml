==Biography==
Flanagin was born in [[Roadstown, New Jersey]], and educated in [[Quaker]] schools in [[New Jersey]]. At the age of eighteen, he became a professor of [[mathematics]]. Flanagin moved west and opened his own private school in [[Paoli, Illinois]]. He studied [[law]] and was admitted to the [[Illinois]] [[bar (law)|bar]] in 1837.  He married Martha Eliza Nash-Flanagin and had a son, Nash Flanagin.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Newberry, Farrar. “Harris Flanagin.” Arkansas Historical Quarterly 17 (Spring 1955): 3–20.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Career==
Flanagin moved to Arkansas and entered [[politics]]. He served in the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1842 to 1844.Newberry, Farrar. “Harris Flanagin.” Arkansas Historical Quarterly 17 (Spring 1955): 3–20.

During the [[American Civil War]], he served in the [[Confederate States Army]] as a [[Captain (land)|Captain]] and rose to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] before the conflict was over. He served with the [[2nd Arkansas Mounted Rifles]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Harrell, John M., &amp;quot;Confederate Military History, a library of Confederate States Military History&amp;quot;, Volume 10.2, Arkansas, Page 321, Accessed 1 August 2011, http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2001.05.0254%3Achapter%3D11%3Apage%3D321&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1862, Flanagin was elected Governor of Arkansas and was recalled from active duty to take office.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Yearns, W. Buck, ed. The Confederate Governors. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1985.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; His administration dealt primarily with war related measures and maintaining order and continuing government while undergoing an invasion. His administration was faced with [[shortage]]s of critical items, [[inflation|rising prices]], care of fallen soldier&amp;apos;s families, and related problems. During the war the government was forced to suspend the collection of [[tax]]es and financed the war with paper &amp;quot;war bonds&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Newberry, Farrar. “Harris Flanagin.” Arkansas Historical Quarterly 17 (Spring 1955): 3–20.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The capitol at [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] fell to Union troops on September 10, 1863. Flanagin seized as many government documents as he could and fled to [[Washington, Arkansas]] where he set up a temporary capitol.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;amp;GRid=18487 |title= Harris T Flanagin|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
