They are resting their feet on a bag of abundance. 3rd century, [[Takht-i-Bahi]], [[Mardan]], ([[Gandhara]]), [[Pakistan]], [[British Museum]].]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hārītī&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Avestan]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Harauhuti&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), is an [[Iran]]ic ogress and [[Bactria]]n ([[Peshawar]]i) mythological figure who was later transformed into a symbol for the protection of children, easy delivery, happy child rearing and parenting, harmony between husband and wife, love, and the well-being and safety of the family. Women without children sometimes prayed to her to help them become pregnant.

Unlike her Indian cognante [[Saraswati]] ( the [[Sanskrit]] version of the [[Avestan]] word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Harauhuti&amp;apos;&amp;apos; both words meaning the [[Indus River]]), who was to the Indians, a goddess, Hariti to the Iranian Gandharans was originally a cannibalistic [[daeva]] or demon. [[Bactria]]n mythology describes Hariti as having hundreds of children whom she loved and doted upon but to feed them, she abducted and killed the children of others. With the arrival of Buddhism to [[Gandhara]] from across the [[Indus River]], this mythology takes a new twist. That is, the bereaved mothers of Hariti&amp;apos;s victims begin to plead to [[Gautama Buddha|Śākyamuni Buddha]] to save them.

Śākyamuni steals Aiji, youngest of Hariti&amp;apos;s sons, and hides him under his [[rice]] [[bowl (vessel)|bowl]]. Hariti desperately searches for her missing son throughout the universe. Finally, she pleads with Shakyamuni for help.  The Shakyamuni Buddha then points out that she is suffering because she has lost one of hundreds of her own children, and asks her if she could imagine the suffering of those parents whose only child she has devoured. Hariti replies contritely that their suffering must be many times greater than hers, and vows to protect all children. She repents, converts to [[Buddhism]] and from then on, only feeds upon pomegranates as a substitute for children&amp;apos;s flesh. So after the arrival of Buddhism in Gandhara, Hariti is transformed from an [[daeva|Iranian demon]] to the Buddhist figure of easy birthing as well as that of protection and parenting of children. More likely though, the alteration in the story of Hariti and her successful conversion to Buddhism seems to be an early strategy with which to convert the Iranian Gandharans from [[Zoroastrianism]], and [[Animism]] to [[Buddhism]].

And so the legend of Hariti, though Iranian in origin, became incorporated into Buddhist lore after the arrival of Buddhism to [[Bactria]], and with it, spread to the far reaches of east Asian lands such as [[China]], and then [[Japan]]; a country where the Gandharan Hariti is today known as Kishimojin.

More recent stories of East Asian origin also describe Hariti as an aspect of [[Kuan Yin|Kannon]]. In actuality, Hariti appears to be the progenitor of the pre-[[Zoroastrian]] [[Indo-Iranian peoples|Iranian]] goddess Hurvatat.
