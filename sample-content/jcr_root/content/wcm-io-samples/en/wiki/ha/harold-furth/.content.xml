&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Harold P. Furth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (January 13, 1930, [[Vienna]] - February 21, 2002, [[Philadelphia]]) was an [[Austria]]n-American [[physicist]].

Furth emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1941. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] with a Bachelor&amp;apos;s degree in 1951 and received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1960. Furth worked at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] for several years before going to [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]] (PPPL) where he would spend the rest of his career working in [[plasma physics]] and [[nuclear fusion]]. He was also a professor of [[astrophysics]] at [[Princeton University]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;furth_1995&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Furth, H. P. (1995) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fusion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Scientific American]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;273&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;(3), 174-176.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the late 1960s Furth contributed some important theoretical work on resistive [[magnetohydrodynamics]] instabilities in a slightly resistive plasma.

In 1981 Furth became the director at PPPL and led the laboratory until 1990 during record setting [[magnetic fusion energy]] experiments on the largest [[tokamak]] in the country, the [[Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor]] (TFTR).

He was awarded the [[The Franklin Institute Awards|Delmer S. Fahrney Medal]] in 1992.

Furth was a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and died of a heart ailment.
