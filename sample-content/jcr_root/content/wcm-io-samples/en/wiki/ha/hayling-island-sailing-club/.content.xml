Located on an isolated sandy [[peninsula]] known as &amp;quot;Sandy Point,&amp;quot; at the entrance to [[Chichester Harbour]], [[England]], the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hayling Island]] Sailing Club&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was founded in 1921.

The &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; club house was built in 1936. The club built a new club house in 2003, which was inaugurated by HRH [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]].

Nearby waters can be used as a mock-[[Olympic Games|Olympic]] track, and regular classes are held to teach the basics of [[sailing]].
