&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Harem&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, {{nihongo|hāremumono|ハーレムもの}}, broadly, is a loose subgenre of [[anime]] and [[manga]] characterized by a protagonist (or several protagonists) surrounded, usually amorously, by three or more members of the opposing sex and/or love interests.&amp;lt;ref name=johnanime&amp;gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.animenation.net/blog/2009/04/17/ask-john-what-distinguishes-harem-anime/ | title = Ask John: What Distinguishes Harem Anime? | first=John|last=Oppliger|publisher= Anime Nation |date= April 17, 2009|accessdate= 2009-11-16}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The most common and practically tantamount scenario is a male-oriented harem anime where the main male character is surrounded by a group of females; when it is a female-oriented harem anime, it is informally referred to as a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;{{visible anchor|reverse harem}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or {{nihongo|gyakuhāremu|[[:wikt:逆|逆]]ハーレム|}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} More recent variants include removing the protagonist&amp;apos;s opposing sex and/or [[gender identity]] to better appeal to a more broadly diverse audience, such as [[futanari]]-oriented harems, [[yuri (genre)|yuri]]-oriented harems, and [[yaoi]]-oriented harems (as with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Gakuen Heaven]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

==Structure==
Because romance is rarely the main focus of an entire series,{{ref label|a|a|none}} harem structure is ambiguous. The most distinguishable trait is arguably the group of girls who accompany, and in some instances cohabitate with the boy, and while intimacy is just about customary, it is never necessary; when it is present, there must be a minimum of two girls who express it.  Additionally, it is not essential for there to be one exclusive boy; many can exist as long as they are given less attention or the story calls for an unusually obscure sex ratio.&amp;lt;ref name= &amp;quot;johnanime&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Harem ending==
Some visual novels offer a &amp;quot;harem ending&amp;quot; route,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Harem Ending|url=http://vndb.org/g434|work=The Visual Novel Database|accessdate=27 May 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; where the main character pursues a romantic relationship with multiple other characters simultaneously, with the consent of the other characters. In some cases, the harem ending is unavoidable.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Unavoidable Harem Ending|url=http://vndb.org/g1017|work=The Visual Novel Database|accessdate=27 May 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
Examples of harem anime include &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Rosario x Vampire]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Princess Lover]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Example of Reverse Harem anime include &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Uta no Prince-sama]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[La Corda d&amp;apos;Oro]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

==Criticism==
Harem is criticized for often excessive use of [[cliché]]s and [[stock characters]], occasionally to the point where stock characters are inserted simply to broaden the title&amp;apos;s appeal to viewers with narrow interests in character [[archetypes]].  Additionally, harem is often characterized by decidedly shallow, violent female characters, to the point where the generalization becomes [[misogyny|misogynistic]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.comedyvideoscentral.com/Harem_anime.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Other ethical objections are based on the positive light in which [[polygamy]] is cast.

==Notes==
&amp;lt;small&amp;gt;
:a. {{note label|a|a|none}} &amp;quot;Series&amp;quot; implies any that are designated as a harem.
