[[File:Crane fly halteres.jpg|thumb|320px|right|[[Crane fly]], with a pair of halteres visible behind the wings as appendages, about as long as the animal&amp;apos;s [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], with knobs on the end]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Halteres&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPAc-en|h|æ|l|ˈ|t|ɪər|iː|z}}; singular &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;halter&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;haltere&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) are small knobbed structures modified from the hind wings (or front wings in the case of [[Strepsiptera]]) in some two-winged [[insect]]s. They are flapped rapidly and function as [[gyroscope]]s, informing the insect about rotation of the body during flight.&amp;lt;ref name=klowden/&amp;gt; The word &amp;apos;halter&amp;apos; comes from Greek ἁλτήρ, a double knobbed device used in Ancient Greece by athletes during training in jumping.

In Diptera, the formation of the haltere during [[metamorphosis]] is dependent on the [[homeotic gene]] [[Ultrabithorax]] (Ubx). If this gene is experimentally deactivated, the haltere will develop into a fully developed wing.&amp;lt;ref name=klowden&amp;gt;Klowden, M. J. (2007). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Physiological systems in insects&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Elsevier/Academic Press. pp. 497-499.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This is an excellent illustration of an important mechanism of a simple homeotic gene change can result in a radically different [[phenotype]].

Halteres flap up and down as the wings do and operate as [[vibrating structure gyroscope]]s. Every vibrating object tends to maintain its plane of vibration if its support is rotated, a result of [[Newton&amp;apos;s laws of motion|Newton&amp;apos;s first law]]. If the body of the insect changes direction in flight or rotates about its axis, the vibrating halteres thus exert a force on the body. The insect detects this force with [[Sensory system|sensory organs]] known as [[campaniform sensilla]] located at the base of the halteres. The planes of vibration of the two halteres are [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] to each other, each forming an angle of about 45 degrees with the axis of the insect; this increases the amount of information gained from the halteres.

Halteres thus act as a [[Balance (ability)|balancing]] and [[guidance system]], helping these insects to perform their fast [[aerobatics]]. In addition to providing rapid feedback to the muscles steering the wings, they also play an important role in stabilizing the head during flight.
