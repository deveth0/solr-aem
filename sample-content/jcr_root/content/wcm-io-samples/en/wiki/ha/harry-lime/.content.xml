&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Harry Lime&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[fictional character]] and the subject of [[Carol Reed|Carol Reed’s]] 1949 film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Third Man]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He was portrayed by [[Orson Welles]] in the film. The character was created by Reed’s close friend and author [[Graham Greene]] with his novella of the [[The Third Man#Development|same name]].

== Story plot about Harry Lime ==

The films starts shortly after [[World War II]], when unemployed writer [[Holly Martins]] ([[Joseph Cotton]]) arrives in Vienna to meet Harry, his old friend from school, who has offered him a job. On the arrival, he learns that Harry has just died, hit by a truck in front of his building, and he goes to his funeral. At Lime&amp;apos;s funeral, Martins meets Sergeant Paine ([[Bernard Lee]]) and Major Calloway ([[Trevor Howard]]), who are [[Royal Military Police|British Army Police]]. Martins meets a friend of Lime&amp;apos;s, &amp;quot;Baron&amp;quot; Kurtz ([[Ernst Deutsch]]), who tells Martins that he and another friend, Popescu ([[Siegfried Breuer]]), carried Lime to the side of the street after the accident and, before he died, Lime asked them to take care of Martins and Lime&amp;apos;s girlfriend, Anna Schmidt ([[Alida Valli]]).

Martins goes to see Anna and becomes suspicious that Lime&amp;apos;s death was not an accident. The porter at Lime&amp;apos;s apartment building says that Lime was killed immediately and that three men carried the body, not two. Martins and Anna discover that the police are searching her flat, who confiscate a [[Identity document forgery|forged]] [[passport]] and detain her. The next evening Martins visits Lime&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;medical advisor&amp;quot;, Dr. Winkel (Erich Ponto), who says that he arrived at the accident after Lime was pronounced dead, and only two men were there.

Calloway again advises Martins to leave Vienna, but Martins refuses and demands that Lime&amp;apos;s death be investigated. Calloway reveals that Lime&amp;apos;s [[Racket (crime)|racket]] was stealing [[penicillin]] from [[military hospital]]s, diluting it, and selling it on the [[black market]], leading to many deaths. Martins, convinced, agrees to leave.

Martins learns that Anna too has been told about Lime&amp;apos;s crimes and is about to be sent to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] sector. Leaving her apartment, Martins notices someone watching from a dark doorway &amp;amp;mdash; none other than Lime, who flees and vanishes.  Martins summons Calloway, who deduces that Lime has escaped through the sewers. The British police exhume Lime&amp;apos;s coffin and discover that the body is that of the orderly who stole the penicillin for Lime.

The next day, Martins meets with Lime, and they ride Vienna&amp;apos;s Ferris wheel, the [[Wiener Riesenrad]]. Lime obliquely threatens Martins, reveals the full extent of his ruthlessness, and then reiterates his job offer before leaving quickly. Calloway then asks Martins to help capture Lime, and Martins agrees, asking for Anna&amp;apos;s safe conduct out of Vienna in exchange. However, when Anna learns this, she refuses to leave. Exasperated, Martins decides to leave, but on the way to the airport, Calloway stops at a hospital to show Martins children dying of [[meningitis]] that had been treated using Lime&amp;apos;s diluted penicillin.

Lime arrives to rendezvous with Martins, but Anna warns him. He tries once again to escape using the sewer tunnels, but the police are there in force. Lime shoots and kills Paine, but Calloway shoots and wounds Lime. Badly injured, Lime drags himself up a ladder to a street grating, but he cannot lift it. Martins then kills him using Paine&amp;apos;s revolver. Later, Martins attends Lime&amp;apos;s second funeral.
