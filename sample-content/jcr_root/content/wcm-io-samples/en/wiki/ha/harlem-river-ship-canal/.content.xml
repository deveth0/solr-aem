&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Harlem River Ship Canal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a channel connecting the [[Hudson River]] and [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]] to the [[Harlem River]] in [[New York City]], separating the neighborhood of [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] from the island of [[Manhattan]].  Marble Hill, part of the borough of Manhattan, was cut off from the island by the construction of the ship canal and is now located on the mainland after the previous course of the river was filled in.

The Harlem River Ship Canal was cut through upper Manhattan to allow larger ships to navigate. It was completed in 1895.  To allow passage through the remainder of the river, the existing fixed bridges were replaced by drawbridges.

Spuyten Duyvil Creek originally flowed north of Manhattan&amp;apos;s Marble Hill, and the completion of the canal to the south turned Marble Hill into an island, until 1914, when the original creekbed was filled in and Marble Hill became physically attached to the Bronx.

Today Spuyten Duyvil Creek, the Harlem River Ship Canal, and the Harlem River form a continuous channel. The Ship Canal is crossed by the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]], a [[vertical lift bridge]] carrying vehicular and pedestrian traffic on one level, and the subway on the upper level.
