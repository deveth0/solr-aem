In [[sailing]], a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;halyard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;halliard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a line ([[rope]]) that is used to hoist a [[ladder]], [[sail]], a [[flag]] or a [[Yard (sailing)|yard]].  The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;halyard&amp;apos;&amp;apos; comes from the phrase, &amp;apos;to haul yards&amp;apos;.  Halyards, like most other parts of the [[running rigging]], were classically made of natural fibre like [[manila hemp|manila]] or [[hemp]].

==Sail types==
* A [[square rig]] sail with a halyard is mounted on a lifting [[yard (sailing)|yard]] that is free to slide on a short section of the mast. The halyard is used to raise (hail or hal)  the yard when setting the sail.
* A [[gaff rig]]ged sail has two; a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;throat halyard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to lift the end of the gaff nearer the mast, and a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;peak halyard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to lift the outer end.
* A more modern triangular [[Bermuda rig|(Bermuda or &amp;quot;Marconi&amp;quot;)]] sail has only one halyard which is attached at its uppermost point (the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;head&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

==Fastenings==
Halyards can be attached a number of ways to the head of a triangular sail. The most common methods are as follows:
# A [[shackle]] through a [[headboard (ship)|headboard]] on the sail.
# A [[bowline]] through a hole in the head.
# A [[half hitch]] with a [[figure-of eight knot]], this knot is preferred over a bowline because it allows the sail to get closer to the top of the mast.

The other end of the halyard is usually attached to the mast at its foot by way of a [[Cleat (nautical)|cleat]]. It is convention in some places to fasten the main halyard (for the [[mainsail]]) on the [[starboard]] side of the mast and the [[jib]] halyard to the [[port]] side. This allows quicker access to the lines in a time-critical situation.

==Jumping/sweating the halyard==
&amp;quot;Jumping the halyard&amp;quot; is a technique used to raise a large sail quickly by employing a few crew members to work simultaneously on the halyard. The person &amp;apos;&amp;apos;jumping&amp;apos;&amp;apos; stands next to the mast and manually grabs the halyard as high as he can (sometimes this necessitates jumping) and pulling it down as fast and far as possible. While this crew member reaches for the next heave, a second crew member &amp;apos;tails&amp;apos; or takes up the slack created by the jumper, on a [[winch]]. When the person jumping can no longer pull up the sail simply by hanging on the halyard, he must &amp;quot;sweat&amp;quot; the line.

To &amp;quot;sweat&amp;quot; the halyard is to take as much slack out of it as possible.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;dict&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Lenfestey|first=Tom|title=&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Sailor&amp;apos;s Illustrated Dictionary&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|publisher=Globe Pequot|date=2001|pages=462|isbn=1-58574-281-3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=A8zcGJKcliAC&amp;amp;pg=PA462&amp;amp;dq=%22sweat+a+line%22|accessdate=2008-03-14}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This may be done with a winch, or manually. To manually sweat a halyard, the sweater grasps the line and, in a fluid motion, hauls it laterally towards himself, then down toward the deck, letting the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;tailer&amp;apos;&amp;apos; take up the new slack.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;toss&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Toss|first=Brion|title=&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Complete Rigger&amp;apos;s Apprentice&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|publisher=International Marine|date=1998|pages=44, 378|isbn=0-07-064840-9|accessdate=2008-03-14}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
