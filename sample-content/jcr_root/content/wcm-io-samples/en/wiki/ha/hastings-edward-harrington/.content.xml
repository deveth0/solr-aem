&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hastings Edward Harington&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (9 November 1832 â€“ 20 July 1861) was an [[England|English]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces.

==Background==
Harington was born in [[Hinton Parva]], [[Wiltshire]] in 1832 and educated at  [[Reading School]].

==Military career==
Harington&amp;apos;s military career began on June 12, 1852 when he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the [[Bengal Artillery]]. During the Indian Mutiny he was severely wounded at Trimmoo Ghat. He was present throughout the [[Siege of Delhi]], and after the fall of the city he proceeded with the Grethed&amp;apos;s column towards [[Cawnpore]] taking an active part in the engagements at Maligurh Fort, [[Allygurh]] and [[Agra]]. He was present at the relief of the garrison at [[Lucknow]], where his courage gained him the [[Victoria Cross]], for which he was elected by the vote of his fellow officers. During these operations he was most dangerously wounded.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Berners Street 1862&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Nisbet and Co, Berners Street, British Army Scripture Readers&amp;apos; &amp;amp; Soldier&amp;apos;s Friend Society, (1862)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He was afterwards present at the siege and capture of Lucknow and joined in the pursuit of the rebels towards Rohileund until he was severely wounded at Rooyah. This last wound compelled him to go to the [[Himalayas]] to recover his health; but deriving only temporary relief and still being troubled by a bullet which remained in his back, he was obliged to return to England and after undergoing a painful operation the bullet was extracted. His health being partially restored he returned to his duty in October 1860. Shortly after his arrival in India he proceeded on service with the [[Sikkim]] Field Force and was afterwards appointed [[adjutant]] 6th Battalion Bengal Artillery at Agra where he died from [[cholera]] on July 20, 1861 having achieved the rank of [[Captain (land)|captain]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Berners Street 1862&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
