&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Harold Edward Monro&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (14 March 1879 â€“ 16 March 1932) was a British [[poet]], the proprietor of the [[Poetry Bookshop]] in [[London]] which helped many famous poets bring their work before the public.

Monro was born in [[Brussels]], but his parents were [[Scotland|Scottish]].  He was educated at [[Radley College|Radley]] and at [[Caius College, Cambridge]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Venn|id=MNR898HE|name=Monro, Harold Edward}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  His first collection of poetry was published in 1906.  He founded a poetry magazine, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Poetry Review]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was to be very influential.  In 1912, he founded the Poetry Bookshop in [[Bloomsbury]], [[London]], publishing new collections at his own expense and rarely making a profit, as well as providing a welcoming environment for readers and poets alike.  Several poets, including [[Wilfred Owen]], actually lodged in the rooms above the bookshop.  Monro was also  closely involved with [[Edward Marsh (polymath)|Edward Marsh]] in the publication of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Georgian Poetry]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Although homosexual, he married before [[World War I]], but he and his wife separated and were divorced in 1916.  In 1917, he was called up for military service, a very unhappy experience for him.  His health soon gave way, and he returned to run the Poetry Bookshop in 1919.  He was not a mainstream [[war poet]], but did occasionally write about the subject.  In 1920, he married his long-standing assistant, Alida Klementaski.  Their relationship seems to have been an intellectual rather than a physical one.  Monro continued to suffer from [[alcoholism]], which contributed to his early death.
