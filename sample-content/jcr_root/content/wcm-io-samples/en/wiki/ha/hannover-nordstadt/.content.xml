        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nordstadt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (North City) is the university quarter in the German city of [[Hanover]].

It was originally characterized by small factories and a big railway freightyard closed in 1996. During [[World War II]] large parts of the district were destroyed. Today, due to the university and cultural clubs, this district is a preferred residential area for students and people of immigrant background. An almost village-like atmosphere exists around the Luther Church (see photo) where a lot of [[pub]]s and small shops resides. Many alternative project groups have settled here and also numerous [[commune (intentional community)|commune]]s live in these houses. The disbanded factory area of the former &amp;quot;Sprengel Chocolate Factory&amp;quot; created a lot of newspaper headlines during the late eighties and early nineties because it was occupied by young people, most of them [[punk rock|punks]]. Here is where the &amp;quot;famous&amp;quot; annual riots called &amp;quot;[[Chaostage]]&amp;quot; took place, every first weekend in August.
