&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hasidim/Chasidim&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-he|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;חסידים&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}) is the plural of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hasid&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;חסיד&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), meaning &amp;quot;pious&amp;quot;. The honorific &amp;quot;Hasid&amp;quot; was frequently used as a term of exceptional respect in the [[Talmudic]] and early medieval periods. In classic [[Rabbinic literature]] it differs from &amp;quot;[[Tzadik]]&amp;quot;-&amp;quot;righteous&amp;quot;, by instead denoting one who goes beyond the legal requirements of ritual and ethical [[Halacha|Jewish observance]] in daily life. The literal meaning of &amp;quot;Hasid&amp;quot; derives from [[Chesed]]-&amp;quot;kindness&amp;quot;, the outward expression of love for God and other people. This spiritual devotion motivates pious conduct beyond everyday limits. The devotional nature of its description lent itself to a few Jewish movements in history being known as &amp;quot;Hasidim&amp;quot;. Two of these derived from the Jewish [[Jewish mysticism|mystical tradition]], as it could tend towards piety over legalism.

As a personal honorific, both &amp;quot;Hasid&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Tzadik&amp;quot; could be applied independently to a same individual with both different qualities. The 18th-century [[Vilna Gaon]], for instance, while the head of [[Misnagdim|Rabbinic opposition]] to the new Jewish mystical movement that itself became known as &amp;quot;[[Hasidism]]&amp;quot;, was renowned for his righteous life. His scholarship became popularly honored with the formal title of &amp;quot;[[Gaon (Hebrew)|Genius]]&amp;quot;, while amongst the Hasidic movement&amp;apos;s leadership, despite his fierce opposition, he was respectfully referred to as &amp;quot;The [[Gaon (Hebrew)|Gaon]], the Hasid from Vilna&amp;quot;.

In the aggregate, it may refer to members of any of the following Jewish movements:
* [[Hasidic Judaism]], the popular following, mystical revival movement of 18th century Eastern Europe until today
* [[Hasideans]], pietists or &amp;quot;Jewish Puritans&amp;quot; of the Maccabean period, around the 2nd century BCE
* [[Chassidei Ashkenaz]], ascetic German mystical-ethical pietists of the 12th and 13th centuries
