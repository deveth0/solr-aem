&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hainault&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|eɪ|n|ɔː|t}} is an area in the [[London Borough of Redbridge]] in north east [[London]]. It is a suburban development located {{convert|12.2|mi|km|1}} north east of [[Charing Cross]]. The area is split between the Chigwell and Ilford [[post town]]s in the [[IG postcode area]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Royal Mail, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Address Management Guide&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (2004)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The area is part of the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] and the suburb of Hainault is bordered on the east by [[Hainault Forest Country Park]], by open land to the north and the boundary with the [[Epping Forest (district)|Epping Forest]] district of Essex.

==History==
===Origins===
The name Hainault was recorded as &amp;apos;Hyneholt&amp;apos; in 1239, and means &amp;apos;monastic woodland&amp;apos;. This area was first recorded as a separate district in 1221. There is no connection with King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]&amp;apos;s wife, [[Philippa of Hainault]], though the current spelling may have been influenced by way of [[folk etymology]].

The area was mainly forested, it was owned by [[Barking Abbey]] and formed part of the [[Royal Forest]] of Essex.  The large density of forest meant the area was predominately used for the provision of [[timber]] for building [[ships]] and houses. A decline in demand for timber, and a greater demand for food, led in 1851 to an Act of Parliament authorising the deforestation of much of Hainault Forest. Within six weeks 3000 acres of woodland was cleared.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.hainaultforest.co.uk/3Forest%20of%20Essex.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Hainault lay just inside the [[Ilford Urban District]] of [[Essex]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.npemap.org.uk/tiles/map.html#544,191,1 New Popular Edition Maps]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; almost straddling the border of [[Chigwell Urban District]].&amp;lt;ref name=vision_chigwell&amp;gt;Vision of Britain - [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10199890&amp;amp;c_id=10001043 Chigwell UD]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 1965 Ilford Urban District along with an area of {{convert|81|acre|km2|1}} from Chigwell Urban District near Hainault were transferred to form the [[London Borough of Redbridge]] in [[Greater London]], along with other areas, namely [[Municipal Borough of Wanstead and Woodford|Wanstead and Woodford]], and that part of [[Dagenham Urban District]] extending to Hainault Forest. The population of the area transferred from Chigwell was 7,071 in 1961.&amp;lt;ref name=vision_chigwell/&amp;gt;

===Development===
Urban development began after August 1856, when the [[Great Eastern Railway]] built a line between [[Stratford station|Stratford]] and [[Loughton tube station|Loughton]]. In 1903, from the line at [[Woodford, London|Woodford]] Junction, a [[Fairlop Loop|loop line]] to [[Ilford railway station|Ilford]] was opened. [[Hainault tube station|Hainault]] was one of the stations on that line.

Although it had been hoped that housing development would ensue from the building of the railway, it was a long time coming. Hainault station was closed from 1908, five years after opening; development began in the late 1920s, and the station was reopened in 1930. As a result of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] [[New Works Programme]] 1935–40 (not completed until 1948 because of [[World War II]]) the line was taken over from the [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]] and converted for use by [[London Underground]] trains. By this time the suburb of Hainault was completed.
