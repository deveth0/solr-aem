In [[tetrapod]]s, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hallux&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;big toe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;great toe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is the innermost (most [[Lateral and medial|medial]]) [[toe]] of the [[foot]]. Despite its name it may not be the longest toe on the foot of some individuals. It is counted as digit I (one). The adjective form is &amp;quot;hallucal&amp;quot;.

The name stems from the [[Latin]] for the same, similar to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;pollex&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which refers to the [[thumb]], the corresponding digit of the [[hand]].

==Digit ratio==
{{see also|Digit ratio}}
In [[human]]s, the hallux is usually longer than the [[second toe]]. This is an [[Mendelian inheritance|inherited]] trait in humans, where the [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] [[gene]] causes a longer second toe (&amp;quot;[[Morton&amp;apos;s toe]]&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Greek foot&amp;quot;) while the [[Zygosity|homozygous]] recessive [[genotype]] presents with the more common trait: a longer hallux.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{OMIM|189200|Toes&amp;amp;nbsp;â€” relative lengths of first and second}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; People with the rare genetic disease &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; characteristically have a short hallux which appears to turn inward, or medially, in relation to the foot.

In [[bird]]s with [[anisodactyl]] or [[heterodactyl]] feet, the hallux is opposed or directed backwards and allows for grasping and perching.

==Evolution==
While the thumb is often mentioned as one of the signature characteristics in humans, this manual digit remains partially primitive and is actually present in all [[primates]]. In humans, the most [[derived]] digital feature is the hallux.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal | ref = harv

}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Pathology==
A common problem involving the big toe is the formation of [[bunion]]s (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hallux valgus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), a deformity characterized by lateral deviation of the great toe, often erroneously described as an enlargement of bone or tissue around the joint at the head of the big toe.

The big toe is also the most common locus of [[ingrown nail]]s and [[gout]] attacks.
