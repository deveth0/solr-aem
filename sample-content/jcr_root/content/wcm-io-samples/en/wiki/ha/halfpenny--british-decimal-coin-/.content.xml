The [[United Kingdom|British]] decimal &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;half penny (½p)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was first issued on 15 February 1971, the [[Decimal Day|day the British currency was decimalised]]. In practice it had been available from banks in bags for some weeks previously.

The decimal half penny, worth 1.2 pre-decimal pence, enabled the prices of some low-value items to be more accurately translated to the new decimal currency. It also allowed the pre-decimal [[British sixpence coin|sixpence]] to remain in circulation (with a value of 2½ new pence) alongside the new decimal coinage. In the same vein, a decimal quarter-penny coin (to be struck in [[aluminium]]) was also proposed (which would have allowed the pre-decimal [[History of the threepence|threepence]] to continue to circulate with a value of 1.25 new pence), but ended up never being produced.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.tclayton.demon.co.uk/dec.html &amp;quot;The Change to Decimal Coinage&amp;quot;], Tony Clayton&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The half penny coin was minted in bronze. It was the smallest decimal coin by both size and value, weighing 1.78 grams and measuring 17.14 millimetres in diameter. It was nicknamed the &amp;quot;tiddler&amp;quot; on account of its size, and soon became Britain&amp;apos;s least favourite coin.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;BBCNews&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/1/newsid_2828000/2828819.stm 1984: Halfpenny coin to meet its maker], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;BBC News&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[HM Treasury|The Treasury]] had continued to argue that the half penny was important in the fight against inflation (preventing prices from being rounded up).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;BBCNews&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; The 1984 half penny was issued only in mint and proof sets by the [[Royal Mint]], and the coin was demonetised and withdrawn from circulation in December 1984.

The reverse of the coin, designed by [[Christopher Ironside]], was simply a crown, with the fraction &amp;quot;½&amp;quot; below the crown, and either &amp;lt;small&amp;gt;NEW PENNY&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt; (1971&amp;amp;ndash;1981) or &amp;lt;small&amp;gt;HALF PENNY&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt; (1982–1984) above the crown.

During the existence of the coin, only one obverse was used – the head of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] by [[Arnold Machin]], with the inscription &amp;lt;small&amp;gt;ELIZABETH II [[British coinage#D.G.REG.F.D.|D.G.REG.F.D.]] year&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;br clear=left&amp;gt;
