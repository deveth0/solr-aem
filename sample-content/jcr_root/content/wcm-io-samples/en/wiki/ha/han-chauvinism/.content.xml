&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Han chauvinism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: &amp;lt;small&amp;gt;[[Simplified Chinese characters|s]]&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt; {{linktext|汉|沙文主义}}, &amp;lt;small&amp;gt;[[traditional|t]]&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt; {{linktext|漢|沙文主義}}, &amp;lt;small&amp;gt;[[pinyin|p]]&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hàn shāwénzhǔyì&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a term coined by [[Mao Zedong]] in 1956 to criticize ethnocentrism among the majority [[Han (people)|Han people]] of China. In his speech, titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ten Major Relations&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Mao stated that &amp;quot;on the relationship between the Han nationality and the minority nationalities.... we put the emphasis on opposing Han chauvinism.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book| last = Li| first = Gucheng| title = A Glossary of Political Terms of The People&amp;apos;s Republic of China | year = 1995| publisher = Chinese University Press | pages = 38–39| isbn  = 9789622016156}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This anti-chauvinistic idea is part of the [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[zhonghua minzu]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; conception of China as a multi-ethnic [[nation]], both historically and in the present, which includes not only the Han but also 56 ethnic minorities. This is expressed in the [[constitution of the People&amp;apos;s Republic of China]], which states that China is a &amp;quot;unitary [multiethnic] state created jointly by the people of all its nationalities&amp;quot; and that &amp;quot;it is necessary to combat big [ethnic group] chauvinism, mainly Han chauvinism, and to combat local [ethnic] national[ist] chauvinism.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ghai&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book| last = Ghai | first = Yash | title = Autonomy and Ethnicity: Negotiating Competing Claims in Multi-Ethnic States | year = 2000 | publisher = Cambridge University Press| page = 77| isbn  = 9780521786423}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The PRC&amp;apos;s notions of Han chauvinism and China as a multicultural state have been subject to criticism. One critical view is that the Han Chinese &amp;quot;are less homogeneous than official policy recognizes.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ghai&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Zhonghua minzu has been criticized as an invention of the 20th century, and was only adopted by the Communist Party to criticize the failures of the rival [[Kuomintang]], which officially promoted zhonghua minzu as part of its nationalist ideology, but was unable to implement successful reforms that benefited minorities.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;liu&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book| last = Liu | first = Xiaoyuan | title = Recast All Under Heaven: Revolution, War, Diplomacy, and Frontier China in the 20th Century | year = 2010 | publisher = Recast All Under Heaven: Revolution, War, Diplomacy, and Frontier China in the 20th Century | pages = 115-116| isbn  = 9781441134899}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
