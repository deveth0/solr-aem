{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hazu District&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|幡豆郡|Hazu-gun}} is a former rural [[districts of Japan|district]] located in southeastern [[Aichi Prefecture]], [[Japan]].
As of 2003 (the last data available), the district had an estimated [[population]] of 58,921 and a [[population density]] of 696.88 persons per km². Its total area was 84.55&amp;amp;nbsp;km².

==History==
Hazu District was one of the ancient districts of [[Mikawa province]], and was mentioned in [[Heian period]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ritsuryō]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; records under a variety of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[kanji]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; spellings. Bordering on [[Mikawa Bay]], one of its noted products was [[sharkskin]] and dried [[shark]] meat, which was sent as taxes to the [[Imperial family of Japan|Imperial household]] in [[Kyoto]].

Modern Hazu District was created on 1 October 1889 as part of the cadastral reforms of the early [[Meiji period]]. Initially, it consisted of [[Nishio, Aichi|Nishio]] town, and 36 villages. On 13 May 1892, [[Isshiki, Aichi|Isshiki]] and Yokosuka were elevated to town status. However, both reverted to village status in 1906, and in a round of consolidation, the remaining number of villages was reduced to 14.
Isshiki regained its town status on 1 October 1923, followed by Yoshida and Hirasaku in 1924, [[Hazu, Aichi|Hazu]] in 1928, Terazu in 1929, leaving the district with 6 towns and 6 villages by 1932.

On 15 December 1953 Nishio was elevated to city status, annexing the towns of Hirasaku and Terazu and two villages later that year. On 10 March 1955 Yoshida and the village of Yokosuka merged to form the town of [[Kira, Aichi|Kira]], leaving the district with three towns and no villages.

1 April 2011, Hazu, Isshiki and Kira all [[Merger and dissolution of municipalities of Japan|merged]] with the city of Nishio, and Hazu District ceased to exist as an administrative division.
