&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hans Wilhelm Schlegel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Überlingen]], 3 August 1951) is a [[Germany|German]] physicist, an [[ESA]] [[astronaut]], and a veteran of two [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle]] missions.

==Early life and education==

Schlegel, born and raised in Germany, graduated as an international exchange student from Lewis Central High School in [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] before studying physics at [[RWTH Aachen|RWTH Aachen University]] in his home country. After having received his university degree, he conducted research in semiconductor physics before being trained as an astronaut in the late 1980s by the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR). He flew as a DLR payload specialist in 1993 aboard Space Shuttle mission [[STS-55]], which included the German-sponsored [[Spacelab]] D-2 research module.

==ESA career==

From 1995 to 1997, he trained as the backup crew member for the German-Russian [[Soyuz TM-25|Mir&amp;apos;97]] mission, and afterwards received additional training in Russia to become qualified as a second board engineer for the [[Mir|Mir space station]]. In 1998, he became a member of the [[European Astronaut Corps]].

Schlegel was a [[Mission Specialist]] on the [[STS-122]] Space Shuttle mission. The mission was charged with the responsibility of putting the [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] laboratory in orbit, in addition to its connection to the [[International Space Station]].

Hans was to perform a spacewalk on the first EVA (EVA1) of STS-122, on Sunday, 10 February 2008, in preparation for attaching the Columbus laboratory to the ISS. The EVA was postponed until Monday 11 February 2008 due to an undisclosed medical issue allegedly affecting Schlegel. [[Stanley G. Love]] performed the spacewalk instead of Schlegel.  However, Schlegel did perform the second EVA on Wednesday 13 February 2008. During the spacewalk, he completed the replacement of the Nitrogen Tank Assembly on the P1 truss of the International Space Station, and installed [[trunnion]] covers on the Columbus module.
