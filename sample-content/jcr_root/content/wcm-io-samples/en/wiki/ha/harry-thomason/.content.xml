        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Harry Z. Thomason&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1940) is an [[United States|American]] [[film]] and [[television]] producer and director, best known for the television series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Designing Women]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Thomason and his wife, [[Linda Bloodworth-Thomason]], are close friends of President [[Bill Clinton]] and U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], and played a major role in President Clinton&amp;apos;s election campaigns.

== Biography ==
Harry Z. Thomason was born in [[Hampton, Arkansas]], the son of a [[Southern Baptist]] deacon. He was a [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], high school science teacher and football coach. He married and divorced [[Judy Crump]], with whom he has a daughter Stacy.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20114310,00.html When Not Battling Delta Burke, Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and Harry Thomason Are Redesigning Cbs : People.com&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1983, Thomason and his second wife, Linda, were married and formed [[Mozark Productions]], the vehicle for several successful television series, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Designing Women]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hearts Afire]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Evening Shade]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 2007, they began production on the [[HBO]] series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[12 Miles of Bad Road]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, starring [[Lily Tomlin]].

Thomason was a close friend of Bill Clinton and produced the glowing biographical film, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Man from Hope&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the centerpiece of the 1992 [[Democratic National Convention]]. Thomason and his partner, [[Darnell Martens]], provided charter air service for the Clinton campaign and served as an image consultant.

After Clinton was elected, Thomason became embroiled in the [[Travelgate]] scandal. His partner, Martens, reported that he had heard rumors that the [[White House Travel Office]] was corrupt and disloyal to the Clintons. This view of the Travel Office was compounded by a series of leaks at the [[White House]] that were unfavorable to the Clintons. Thomason began pressing [[Hillary Clinton]] to investigate the travel office. When the financial irregularities were discovered, the White House called in the [[FBI]]. The resulting firings generated a great deal of negative press coverage and an investigation of the events surrounding it, including Thomason and Martens&amp;apos; air service.

Thomason served as co-chairman of the 1992 [[Presidential Inauguration Committee]] and once again worked as an image consultant at the beginning of the [[Lewinsky scandal]]. Thomason ended up testifying before the Lewinsky [[Grand Jury]].

In 2004, Thomason produced the film documentary version of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Hunting of the President]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from the book by [[Joe Conason]] and [[Gene Lyons]], about political efforts to discredit and defeat Bill and Hillary Clinton.
