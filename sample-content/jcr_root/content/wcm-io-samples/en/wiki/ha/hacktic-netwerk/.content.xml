        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hacktic Netwerk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was originally a [[UUCP]] mail and news forwarding network set up by people surrounding [[Hack-Tic]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] hacker publication. It was established in Amsterdam in 1992 by [[Felipe Rodriquez]], [[Rop Gonggrijp]], [[Paul Jongsma]] and [[Cor Bosman]]. [[Rop Gonggrijp]] edited and published [[Hack-Tic]] and [[Felipe Rodriquez]] operated &amp;quot;Utopia&amp;quot;, a hacker BBS that was one of the largest nodes on the network. Later a system called [[XS4ALL]] was set up to connect paying users to the online Internet (as opposed to access to the offline [[UUCP]] service, which was offered for free). Since many more users used [[XS4ALL]] than any other service, the organization subsequently renamed itself to [[XS4ALL]] and later transformed itself from a non-profit into a for-profit enterprise.
