        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Habibi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ar|حَبيبي }}) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word whose literal meaning is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;my beloved&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (when addressing a male object of affection; the feminine form is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;habibati&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and colloquially &amp;apos;&amp;apos;habibti&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). But it also has the meaning of [[friend]] or [[darling]]. It originates from the adjective &amp;apos;&amp;apos;habib&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;beloved&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).  In addition to its literal meaning, the term can denote any of several less formal relationships and can serve as a term of endearment at the corresponding level (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;e.g.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;friend&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;darling&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).
