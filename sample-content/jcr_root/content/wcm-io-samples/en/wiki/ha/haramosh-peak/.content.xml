&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Haramosh Peak&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Haramosh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peak 58&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[mountain]] located in the [[Karakoram]] [[mountain range|range]] of the [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] of [[Pakistan]]. Its height is also often given as 7,409m.
__NOTOC__

==Location==
Haramosh lies about {{convert|65|km|mi|0}} east of Gilgit, in the south-central region of the [[Rakaposhi-Haramosh Mountains]], a subrange of the Karakoram range. It rises steeply above the north bank of the [[Indus River]], a little ways upstream of its confluence with the [[Gilgit River]]. The [[massif]] has two summits, Haramosh Peak and Haramosh Kutwal Laila Peak.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==Climbing history==
Haramosh was first reconnoitered in 1947 by a [[Swiss]] team, and a [[Germany|German]] team investigated a northeastern route in 1955. In 1957, Tony Streather, John Emery, Bernard Jillot and Rae Culbert, a team from [[Oxford University]] experienced repeated falls and misfortunes during a failed attempt, leading to the deaths of Jillot and Culbert. Streather and Emery survived.  The latter suffered severe frostbite and lost all of his fingers and toes.
The epic tale of this expedition is told in Ralph Barker&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;The Last Blue Mountain&amp;quot;, ISBN 1-904466-30-3.

Haramosh was first climbed on 4 August 1958 by the [[Austria]]ns Heinrich Roiss, Stefan Pauer and Franz Mandl,
via the Haramosh La (a saddle to the northeast) and the East Ridge, roughly the route of the
1957 tragedy.

According to the Himalayan Index,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.alpine-club.org.uk/hi/ Himalayan Index]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; there have been only three more ascents, in 1978 (Japanese, West Ridge), 1979 (unknown party/route), and 1988 ([[Poland|Polish]], Southwest Face).
