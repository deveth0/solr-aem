&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hans Christian Joachim Gram&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (September 13, 1853 - November 14, 1938) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[bacteriologist]].
He was the son of [[Frederik Terkel Julius Gram]], a professor of [[jurisprudence]], and [[Louise Christiane Roulund]].

Gram studied [[botany]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]] and was an assistant in botany to the zoologist [[Japetus Steenstrup]]. His study of plants introduced him to the fundamentals of [[pharmacology]] and the use of the [[microscope]].

He entered medical school in 1878 and graduated in 1883. He travelled throughout Europe between 1878 and 1885. In [[Berlin]], in 1884, he developed a method for distinguishing between two major classes of [[bacteria]]. This technique, the [[Gram staining|Gram Stain]], continues to be a standard procedure in medical [[microbiology]].

In 1891, Gram became a lecturer in [[pharmacology]], and later that year was appointed professor at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In 1900 he resigned his Chair in Pharmacology to become Professor of Medicine.

==Gram stain==
{{Main|Gram staining}}
The work that gained him international reputation was his development of a method of staining [[bacteria]], to make them more visible under a [[microscope]]. The stain later played a major role in classifying [[bacteria]]. Gram was a modest man, and in his initial publication he remarked, &amp;quot;I have therefore published the method, although I am aware that as yet it is very defective and imperfect; but it is hoped that also in the hands of other investigators it will turn out to be useful.&amp;quot; A gram stain is made using a primary stain of [[crystal violet]] and a counterstain of [[safranin]]. Bacteria that turn purple when stained are called &amp;apos;Gram positive&amp;apos;, while those that turn red when counterstained are called &amp;apos;Gram negative&amp;apos;.

==Other work==
His initial work concerned the study of [[Red blood cell]]s in men. He was among the first to recognise that [[macrocyte]]s were characteristic of [[pernicious anaemia]].

After his appointment as professor of medicine in 1900 he published four volumes of clinical lectures which became widely used in [[Denmark]].
He retired in 1923.
