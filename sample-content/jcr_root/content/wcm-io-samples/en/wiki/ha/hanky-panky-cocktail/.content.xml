        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hanky-Panky cocktail&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the brainchild of [[Ada Coleman]]. Her benefactor was [[Rupert D&amp;apos;Oyly Carte]], a member of the family that first produced [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas in London and that built the [[Savoy Hotel]]. When Rupert became chairman of the Savoy in 1903, Ada was given a position at the hotel&amp;apos;s [[American Bar]], where she eventually became the head bartender and made cocktails for the likes of [[Mark Twain]], the Prince of Wales, Prince Wilhelm of Sweden, and Sir [[Charles Hawtrey (stage actor)|Charles Hawtrey]].

Charles Hawtrey was the man for whom &amp;quot;Coley&amp;quot;, as Ada Coleman was affectionately called, created the Hanky-Panky [[cocktail]]. He was a Victorian and Edwardian actor who mentored [[NoÃ«l Coward]].  Coley herself told the story behind the creation of the Hanky-Panky to England&amp;apos;s [[The People (newspaper)|The People]] newspaper in 1925:

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;quot;The late Charles Hawtrey... was one of the best judges of cocktails that I knew. Some years ago, when he was overworking, he used to come into the bar and say, &amp;apos;Coley, I am tired. Give me something with a bit of punch in it.&amp;apos; It was for him that I spent hours experimenting until I had invented a new cocktail. The next time he came in, I told him I had a new drink for him. He sipped it, and, draining the glass, he said, &amp;apos;By Jove! That is the real hanky-panky!&amp;apos; And Hanky-Panky it has been called ever since.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

The Hanky-Panky is a variation on the sweet martini, inasmuch as it calls for gin and sweet vermouth, but Coley&amp;apos;s [[secret ingredient]] was [[Fernet Branca]], a bitter Italian digestivo. By adding a couple of dashes of this herbal elixir, she transformed it into a whole new drink.

==Recipe==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;From &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The_Savoy_Cocktail_Book#The_Savoy_Cocktail_Book|The Savoy Cocktail Book]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Harry Craddock]]
