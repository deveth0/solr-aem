&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Halogen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a five-piece [[musical band|band]] from [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]]. Formed in 1998 by two expatriate [[New Zealand]]ers - Jasmine Yee and Frans Bisschops.

==History==
The band first gained national prominence in Australia through the song &amp;quot;Hole Around My Heart&amp;quot; from their &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Somewhere You&amp;apos;re Alone&amp;apos;&amp;apos; recording.  The song won the [[WAM Song of the Year]] in 2001.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.wam.asn.au/archive-wsoty03.htm WAM Archive]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  With the release of the single &amp;quot;Walkaway&amp;quot;, and an accompanying tour of Australia&amp;apos;s east coast (including a showcase performance at the Australian Music Week), the band furthered their claim for national attention.  The single received rotational airplay on national broadcaster [[Triple J]] and a follow-up single, in the form of &amp;quot;On A Bridge&amp;quot;, followed suit.  Both singles found their way onto the band&amp;apos;s debut album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Save the Ones You Love&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  A third single from the album, &amp;quot;Caught Me&amp;quot;, was subsequently released and also found rotational airplay.

Rather than take a traditional recording approach for their follow-up album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Building On The Edge Of The Sky&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, songwriters Jasmine Yee and Frans Bisschops directed each composition to a different emerging producer.  The result was a brilliant, if somewhat eclectic, recording taking Halogen away from the brooding guitars that previously typified their sound and into the realm of electronica.

Halogen&amp;apos;s third album, titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sirens&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was released on the 17 July 2006, on [[Karmic Hit]], a record label formed by [[Steve Kilbey]], singer/songwriter from seminal Australian band [[The Church (band)|The Church]].

Yee has also undertaken a number of other collaborations include singing on the [[Pendulum (band)|Pendulum]] song, &amp;quot;Sounds of Life&amp;quot; on their 2005 album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hold Your Colour]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, backing vocals for [[Fourth Floor Collapse]] as well as vocals for &amp;quot;Can’t let You be Lonely&amp;quot; by [[The Transients]].

Yee and Bisschops are currently working on a side project, [[She Selexx]], with local producer, Trilby Temperley, the older brother of [[Kavyen Temperley]] ([[Eskimo Joe]]).
