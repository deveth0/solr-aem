__NOTOC__
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;Harbinger&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the 67th [[episode]] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the 15th episode from the [[Star_Trek:_Enterprise#Season_3|third season]].

==Plot==
{{Expand section|date=February 2012}}
This episode balances three plotlines. In the main story, Captain [[Jonathan Archer|Archer]] investigates the appearance of an alien pilot ([[Thomas Kopache]]) at the site of a spatial anomaly. Unknown to the crew, this alien is one of the [[Sphere Builder]]s who will become prominent in later episodes. In a secondary story, the long-simmering anger between Lt. [[Malcolm Reed]] and Major [[Major Hayes|Hayes]] finally comes to a head when they get into a physical fight over their competing roles aboard &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Enterprise&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Lastly, Sub-commander [[T&amp;apos;Pol]] experiences unexpected jealousy when Commander [[Charles Tucker III|Tucker]] begins displaying an attraction to a female MACO, which leads to an emotional confrontation with results that leave both parties surprised and uncomfortable.

==Notes==
* The episode was intended as a &amp;quot;breather&amp;quot; episode between major sections of the [[Xindi (Star Trek)|Xindi]] arc and is noted for introducing a sexual relationship between the characters of Tucker and T&amp;apos;Pol:
** A later episode, &amp;quot;[[Damage (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Damage]],&amp;quot; would explain T&amp;apos;Pol&amp;apos;s un-[[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]]-like behavior in this and other episodes,
** The fourth season episode &amp;quot;[[Home (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Home]]&amp;quot; would further explore the relationship between Tucker and T&amp;apos;Pol, and
** The fourth season episode &amp;quot;[[Bound (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Bound]]&amp;quot; would reveal that their single encounter had had an unexpected side-effect - a telepathic bond.
