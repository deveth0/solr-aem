&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Romualdo Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; served as [[president]] of [[Costa Rica]] on three separate occasions: 1910 to 1914, 1924 to 1928, and 1932 to 1936.

One of the most well known lawyers in Costa Rican history and a  University of Santo Tomás graduate. Shortly after assuming power in 1910, the province of [[Cartago Province|Cartago]] was hit by a powerful earthquake which destroyed most of the city and killed hundreds. One of his main struggles was the rebuilding of the biggest city in the country at the time. After the earthquake, Jiménez outlawed construction with adobe.&amp;lt;ref name=Mandatarios&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Fasciculo 3 Mandatarios de Costa Rica|newspaper=La Nacion|date=5 June 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Another notable aspect of his first term was the consolidation of the country&amp;apos;s external debt with a great part of the debt owed to France being repaid.

During his second term in office, he created the National Insurance Bank, The Bank of Mortgage Credit, the School of Agriculture and founded the Ministry of Health. He also began the electrification of the Pacific railway system and the creation of the Pacific port of [[Puntarenas]]. After his second term he stepped away from the political scene for four years.

He again was elected President in 1932. During his last term in office he concentrated on the country&amp;apos;s infrastructure and educational system. He built several large buildings for school housing, improved and build new roads throughout the country and constructed an aqueduct system that started in the central valley at [[Ojo de Agua]] and flowed into the Pacific Ocean at [[Puntarenas]].&amp;lt;ref name=Mandatarios&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Fasciculo 3 Mandatarios de Costa Rica|newspaper=La Nacion|date=5 June 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; During his administration, the bridge from [[Filadelfia]] and [[Liberia, Costa Rica|Liberia]] was constructed, as was the Old National Theater.

He died in San José on 4 January, 1945.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=Fasciculo 3 Mandatarios de Costa Rica|newspaper=La Nacion|date=5 June 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

His father was two-time president [[Jesús Jiménez Zamora|Jesús Jiménez]].
