&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Richard Verrall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1948) is a former Deputy Chairman of the British [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] (NF) who edited the magazine &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Spearhead (magazine)|Spearhead]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from 1976 to 1980.

==National Front career==
Verrall studied [[History]] at [[Westfield College]], now part of [[Queen Mary, University of London]], obtaining a first class honours degree.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;S. Taylor, 1982, p. 62&amp;quot;&amp;gt;S. Taylor, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The National Front in English Politics&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, London: Macmillan, 1982, p. 62&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Initially a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], Verrall left in the early 1970s, along with a number of members on the right who supported [[Enoch Powell]], to join the NF.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;S. Taylor, 1982, p. 62&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Initially a close supporter of [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]], he was appointed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Spearhead&amp;apos;&amp;apos; editor by Tyndall and used the magazine to discuss the veracity of [[the Holocaust]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;S. Taylor, 1982, p. 62&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; He was also known for his endorsement of [[eugenics]] and [[biological determinism]], adding to this theory that it was equally natural for members of a genetic group to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others of the same group, thus attacking the criticism that the notion of [[sacrifice]] makes this theory inapplicable to humanity.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;S. Taylor, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The National Front in English Politics&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, London: Macmillan, 1982, pp. 63–64&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Despite his initial support for Tyndall, Verrall did not follow him into the [[New National Front]] and indeed was appointed Deputy Chairman of the NF by [[Andrew Brons]] in 1980.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;S. Taylor, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The National Front in English Politics&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, London: Macmillan, 1982, p. 91&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Although appointed to this role Verrall, played little further role in the politics of the NF and was aloof from the struggle between the [[Official National Front]] and the [[Flag Group]]. Instead, he concentrated most of his efforts on writing about the Holocaust.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Written work==
He is best known today for his pamphlet (under the [[pseudonym|assumed name]] of Richard Harwood) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a [[Holocaust denial]] pamphlet which was the subject of the criminal action brought against its Canadian-based publisher [[Ernst Zündel]]. Zündel was ultimately acquitted on the basis that the crime with which he was charged was unconstitutional, but not before the trial court had found the pamphlet to be composed of fabrications and distortions. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the book &amp;quot;misrepresented the work of historians, misquoted witnesses, fabricated evidence, and cited non-existent authorities.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;scc2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{lexum-scc2|1992|2|731}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
