&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ridge lift&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;slope lift&amp;apos;) is created when a [[wind]] strikes an obstacle, usually a mountain ridge or cliff, that is large and steep enough to deflect the wind upward.

If the wind is strong enough, the ridge lift provides enough upward force for [[glider (sailplane)|gliders]], [[hang glider]]s,  [[paraglider]]s and birds to stay airborne for long periods or travel great distances by &amp;apos;slope soaring&amp;apos;. Although unpowered aircraft are usually descending through the air, they will climb if the surrounding air is rising faster than their sink rates. [[Radio-controlled glider|Model glider]] enthusiasts refer to this technique as &amp;quot;slope gliding&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;sloping&amp;quot;.

[[Orville Wright]] used ridge lift setting a duration record of 11 minutes in 1911. However the sport of soaring started in Germany after the First World War. In 1921 Dr. Wolfgang Klemperer broke the Wright Brothers 1911 soaring duration record with a flight of 13 minutes.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.glider-pilot.co.uk/The%20History%20of%20Gliding/The%20History%20of%20Gliding.htm History of soaring]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 1922 [[Arthur Martens]] became the first [[gliding|glider pilot]] to use an updraft rising along a mountain slope to stay aloft for a lengthy period with a flight over an hour.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.deutsches-museum.de/en/flugwerft/exhibitions/sailplanes/ Deutsches Museum web-site]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Ridge lift is generated when the wind blows against a [[hill]], [[ridge]], [[escarpment]] or [[ocean wave]], causing the air to rise.  In meteorology this is known as [[orographic lift]]. The wind creates a region of rising air directly above the slope which may extend some distance upwards and outwards from its face because the airflow follows the upward contour of the hill.  However at near vertical [[cliff]]s, there is usually an area of [[turbulence]] with descending air near the base of the cliff. Downwind of the hill, [[lee waves]] can form that are also used by glider pilots to gain height but this should not be confused with slope lift.

Near slopes rather than vertical cliffs, the strongest lift is often to be found a flight path that intersects with an imaginary line emerging at right angles from the slope.

Long mountain ranges such as those found in [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians]] in the [[United States]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Chile]] have been used by glider pilots to fly in excess of a thousand kilometers in a single flight. Birds, such as many [[seabird]]s (in particular [[albatross]]) and [[Bird of prey|raptor]]s, also use slopes in this way.
