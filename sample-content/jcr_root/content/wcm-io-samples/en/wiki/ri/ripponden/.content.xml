Ripponden is the main settlement in a small group of villages; [[Barkisland]], Ripponden, [[Rishworth]] and [[Soyland]]. The citizens of Ripponden are represented on Ripponden Parish Council. The area is a substantial part of the Ryburn Ward, itself part of [[Calderdale]] metropolitan borough.

Ripponden and its villages were formerly served by the [[Rishworth Branch|Rishworth branch line]] from [[Sowerby Bridge]]; [[Ripponden and Barkisland railway station]] closed to passengers in 1929 and the line was closed completely in 1958.

The area is of archaeological note for the Roman road at Blackstone Edge alone and is also rich in [[neolithic]] and [[bronze age]] remains. At nearby Ringstone Edge can be found a small [[stone circle]] and neolithic settlement. Upon Rishworth Moor, an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] and home to many rare animals, can be found the [[Cat Stones]], a series of ancient round barrow burial sites.
