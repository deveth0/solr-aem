&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Richard Barrow Cadbury&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (29 August 1835 – 22 March 1899) was the second son of the [[Quaker]] [[John Cadbury]], founder of [[Cadbury Schweppes#Cadbury&amp;apos;s|Cadbury&amp;apos;s]] cocoa and chocolate company.

Together with his younger brother [[George Cadbury|George]] he took over the family business in 1861 and in 1878 they acquired 14 acres (57,000 m²) of land in open country, four miles (6&amp;amp;nbsp;km) south of [[Birmingham]] where they opened a new factory in 1879. Over the following years, more land was acquired and a [[model village]] was built for his workers which became known as [[Bournville]].
