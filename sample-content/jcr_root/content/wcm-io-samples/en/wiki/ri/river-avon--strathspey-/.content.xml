{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;River Avon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-en|local|ˈ|ɑː|n}} is a [[river]] in the [[Strathspey, Scotland|Strathspey]] area of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], and a [[tributary]] of the [[River Spey]]. It drains the north-eastern area of the [[Cairngorms|Cairngorm Mountains]] and is largely contained within the [[Cairngorms National Park]]

The source of the River Avon is not on [[Ben Avon]] but some 10 miles further west on the slopes of [[Ben Macdhui (Scotland)|Ben MacDui]], ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]: Beinn MacDhuibh).  From Ben MacDui, the headwaters flow down to [[Loch A&amp;apos;an|Loch Avon]]. The river then continues east down Glen Avon for another 10 miles before turning north towards the village of [[Tomintoul]] and [[Strath Avon]].

== Tributaries ==
Over the first few miles flowing east through the [[Deer forest|Forest of Glenavon]] the Avon gathers to itself numerous small burns, the most notable of which are the Burn of Loin and the Builg Burn originating at Loch Builg.

A mile to the southwest of Tomintoul, the Water of Ailnack enters from the confines of a precipitous gorge - the higher reaches of this watercourse are known as the Water of Caiplich. Downstream of Tomintoul, the Conglass Water originating at the [[Lecht]], enters from the east and the Burn of Lochy enters from Glen Lochy to the west. Above Bridge of Brown, the Lochy is fed in turn by the Burn of Brown. The lowermost tributary of the Avon is the River Livet which enters from [[Glenlivet]] on the right bank at Drumin just as the Avon leaves the national park.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 scale Landranger map sheets 28 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elgin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and 36 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Grantown &amp;amp; Aviemore&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Etymology ==
In common with the various other examples of Avon, the river takes its name from the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;abhainn&amp;apos;&amp;apos; meaning &amp;apos;river&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;stream&amp;apos;. The word, in common with the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;afon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is thought to originate from an early [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ab&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;aub&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ross, D. 2001 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Scottish Place-names&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Birlinn, Edinburgh&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The implications of this (and other) waterways being called simply &amp;apos;[The] River&amp;apos; may be an indicator of ancient beliefs or superstitions.  It is known that the ancient inhabitants of north-western [[Europe]] venerated wet or watery places, including rivers (as attested by both literary and archaeological evidence, e.g. ritual deposition in rivers or bogs).  It is possible that particularly sacred rivers became commonly known simply as &amp;apos;[the] river&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;[the] water&amp;apos;, because their &amp;apos;real&amp;apos; names were sacred and pronouncing them was &amp;apos;dangerous&amp;apos;, or ritually unacceptable (cf. &amp;apos;taking the name of the Lord in vain&amp;apos; in the [[Judaeo-Christian]] tradition).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
