        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Carl Wilhelm Richard H端lsenbeck&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 23, 1892{{spaced ndash}}April 20, 1974) was a [[poet]], [[writer]] and [[drummer]] born in [[Frankenau]], [[Hessen-Nassau]].

Carl Wilhelm Richard H端lsenbeck was a medical student on the eve of [[World War I]].  He was invalided out of the army and emigrated to [[Z端rich]], [[Switzerland]] in February 1916, where he fell in with the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Z端rich)|Cabaret Voltaire]].  In January 1917, he moved to [[Berlin]], taking with him the ideas and techniques which helped him found the Berlin [[Dada]] group. &amp;apos;To make literature with a gun in my hand had for a time been my dream,&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; Huelsenbeck &amp;apos;En Avant Dada&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;he wrote in 1920. His ideas fitted in with left-wing politics current at time in Berlin.  However idealistic Huelsenbeck and his companions were, their challenge &amp;apos;Dada is German Bolshevism&amp;apos; had unfortunate repercussions later, when the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialists]] denounced all aspects of modern art as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[:de:Kulturbolschewismus|Kunstbolschewismus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Later in life, having done a Jungian analysis with [[Hermann Rorschach]], he moved to [[New York City]], where he practiced [[psychoanalysis]] under the name Charles R. Hulbeck at the Karen Horney Clinic. In 1970 he returned to the [[Ticino]] region of [[Switzerland]]. He died 1974 in [[Muralto]], Switzerland.

Huelsenbeck was the editor of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dada Almanach]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and wrote &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dada Sieght]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[En Avant Dada]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and other [[Dada]]ist works.

Huelsenbeck&amp;apos;s autobiography &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Memoirs of a Dada Drummer&amp;apos;&amp;apos; gives detailed accounts of his interactions with many key figures of the movement.

Of his music, [[Hugo Ball]] wrote, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;Huelsenbeck has arrived.  He pleads for an intensification of [[rhythm]] ([[Negro]] rhythm).  He would best love to drum [[literature]] &amp;amp; to [[perdition]].&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Until the end of his life, Huelsenbeck insisted, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;Dada is still existing,&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; although the movement&amp;apos;s other founders might not have agreed.
