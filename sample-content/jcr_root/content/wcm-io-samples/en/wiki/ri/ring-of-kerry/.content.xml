The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ring of Kerry&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ga|Mórchuaird Chiarraí}}) is a 179-km-long circular tourist route in [[County Kerry]], south-western [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Clockwise from [[Killarney]] it follows the [[N71 road (Ireland)|N71]] to [[Kenmare]], then the [[N70 road (Ireland)|N70]] around the [[Iveragh Peninsula]] to [[Killorglin]] – passing through [[Sneem]], [[Waterville, County Kerry|Waterville]], [[Cahersiveen]], and [[Glenbeigh]] – before returning to Killarney via the [[N72 road (Ireland)|N72]].

Popular points include [[Muckross House]] (near Killarney), [[Staigue stone fort]] and [[Derrynane House]], home of [[Daniel O&amp;apos;Connell]]. Just south of Killarney, [[Ross Castle]], [[Lakes of Killarney|Lough Leane]], and [[Ladies View (Ireland)|Ladies View]] (a panoramic viewpoint), all located within [[Killarney National Park]], are major attractions located along the Ring. A more complete list of major attractions along the Ring of Kerry includes: [[Gap of Dunloe]], Bog Village, [[Rossbeigh Beach]], Cahersiveen Heritage Centre, [[Derrynane House]], Skellig Experience, Staigue Fort, Kenmare Lace, [[Moll&amp;apos;s Gap]], [[Ladies View (Ireland)|Ladies View]], [[Torc Waterfall]], Muckross House, The Blue Pool, Ross Castle, [[Ogham]] Stones, St Mary’s Cathedral, [[Muckross Abbey]], Franciscan Friary, Kellegy Church, O’Connell Memorial Church, Sneem Church and Cemetery, [[Skellig Michael]], Beehive Cells and the Stone Pillars marking an important grave.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://infoireland.wordpress.com/2008/07/08/10-things-to-do-in-ireland-before-you-die/ The Ring of Kerry]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

There is also an established walking path named The [[Kerry Way]], which takes its own route, and a signposted Ring of Kerry cycling path which uses older quieter roads where possible.  The Kerry Way roughly follows the scenic driving route of the Ring of Kerry.

There are numerous variations to the route taking in St. Finian&amp;apos;s Bay and [[Valentia Island]] which the official driving ring misses (the official cycling route takes in Valentia Island). As well as some fine beaches, it also offers the Gap of Dunloe, Bog Village, Derrynane House, the Skellig Experience Valentia Island, Molls Gap, Torc Waterfall, Muckross House and Ross Castle.

&amp;quot;The Ring&amp;quot; is a popular day trip and numerous bus companies offer trips during the summer months. As the narrow roads make it difficult for tour coaches to pass, all tour buses run in an anti-clockwise (or counter-clockwise) direction, traveling via Killorglin first. It is recommended that car owners travel in the opposite direction, going first to Kenmare to avoid delays caused by tour buses.  In 2008 [[Automotive navigation system|satellite navigation systems]] were blamed for directing bus drivers in a clockwise direction around the route.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0903/kerry.html Sat-Navs sending Kerry bus drivers astray]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
