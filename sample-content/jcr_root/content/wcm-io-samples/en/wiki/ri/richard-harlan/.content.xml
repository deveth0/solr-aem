&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Richard Harlan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (September 19, 1796 &amp;amp;ndash; September 30, 1843) was an [[United States|American]] [[natural history|naturalist]], [[zoologist]], [[Herpetology|herpetologist]], [[physicist]], and [[paleontologist]]. He was the author of [http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/60930050R &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fauna Americana&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1825)] and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;American Herpetology&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Kelly1920&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|author=Howard Atwood Kelly|title=A Cyclopedia of American Medical Biography: Comprising the Lives of Eminent Deceased Physicians and Surgeons from 1610 to 1910|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GPssAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=6 May 2012|year=1920|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|page=492}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Harlan was born in [[Philadelphia]], to Joshua Harlan, a wealthy [[Quaker]] merchant, and his wife Sarah, one of their ten children. He was three years older than his brother [[Josiah Harlan]], who would become the first American to visit [[Afghanistan]] and who was the presumed inspiration for [[Rudyard Kipling]]&amp;apos;s story [[The Man Who Would Be King]]. He graduated in [[medicine]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] taking time off during his studies to spend a year at sea as a [[ship&amp;apos;s surgeon]] for the [[British East India Company]]. In 1821 he was elected professor of [[comparative anatomy]] in the Philadelphia museum. One of his passions was the collection and study of human skulls. At its peak, his collection contained 275 skulls, the largest such collection in America.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;MacIntyre2004&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|author=[[Ben MacIntyre]]|title=The Man Who Would Be King: The First American in Afghanistan|year=2004|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He died of apoplexy in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Kelly1920&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
