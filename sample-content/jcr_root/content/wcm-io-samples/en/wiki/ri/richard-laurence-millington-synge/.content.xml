&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Richard Laurence Millington Synge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;frs&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1996.0028}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; ([[Liverpool]], 28 October 1914 -  [[Norwich]], 18 August 1994) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[biochemist]], and shared the 1952 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for the invention of partition [[chromatography]] with [[Archer Martin]].

He was a close friend of [[John H. Humphrey]]. Educated at [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], he spent his entire career in research, at locations including [[Wool Industries Research Association]], [[Leeds]] (1941–1943), [[Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine]], [[London]] (1943–1948), [[Rowett Research Institute]], [[Aberdeen]] (1948–1967), and [[Institute of Food Research|Food Research Institute]], [[Norwich]] (1967–1976).

It was during his time in Leeds that he worked with [[Archer John Porter Martin|Archer Martin]], developing partition chromatography, a technique used in the separation mixtures of similar chemicals, that revolutionized analytical chemistry. Between 1942 and 1948 he studied [[peptide]]s of the protein group [[gramicidin]], work later used by [[Frederick Sanger]] in determining the structure of [[insulin]]. In March 1950 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] for which his candidature citation read: &amp;quot;  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Distinguished as a biochemist. Was the first to show the possibility of using counter-current liquid-liquid extraction in the separation of N-acetylamino acids. In collaboration with A.J.P. Martin this led to the development of partition chromatography, which they have applied with conspicuous success in problems related to the composition and structure of proteins, particularly wool keratin. Synge&amp;apos;s recent work on the composition and structure of gramicidins is outstanding and illustrates vividly the great advances in technique for which he and Martin are responsible&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;amp;dsqPos=1&amp;amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27synge%27%29|title=Library and Archive catalogue|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 24 October 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He was for several years the treasurer of the Chemical Information Group of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], and held a Professorship in Biological Sciences at the [[University of East Anglia]] from 1968–1984.
