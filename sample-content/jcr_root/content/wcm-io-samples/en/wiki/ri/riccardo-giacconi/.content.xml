&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Riccardo Giacconi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born October 6, 1931) is an American [[Nobel Prize]]-winning [[astrophysicist]] who laid the foundations of [[X-ray astronomy]].  He is currently a professor at the [[Johns Hopkins University]].

== Biography ==
Born in [[Genoa]], Italy, Giacconi received his [[Laurea#Former status of the Laurea degree|Laurea]] from the [[University of Milan]] before moving to the US to pursue a career in [[astrophysics]] research. He became an [[Naturalization|American citizen]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;NobelBio&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2002/giacconi-autobio.html Biography on the Nobel Foundation website]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2012}}

Since cosmic X-ray radiation is absorbed by the Earth&amp;apos;s atmosphere, space-based telescopes are needed for X-ray astronomy.  Applying himself to this problem, Giacconi worked on the instrumentation for X-ray astronomy; from rocket-borne detectors in the late 1950s and early 1960s, to [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]], the first orbiting X-ray astronomy satellite, in the 1970s.  Giacconi&amp;apos;s pioneering research continued in 1978 with the [[Einstein Observatory]], the first fully imaging X-ray telescope put into space, and later with the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], which was launched in 1999 and is still in operation. Giacconi also applied his expertise to other fields of astronomy, becoming the first director of the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]], the science operations center for the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].

Giacconi was awarded a share of the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2002 &amp;quot;for pioneering contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic X-ray sources&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;NobelCitation&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2002/ Nobel prize citation]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The other shares of the Prize in that year were awarded to [[Masatoshi Koshiba]] and [[Raymond Davis, Jr.]].

Giacconi has held the positions of professor of physics and astronomy (1982&amp;amp;ndash;1997) and research professor (since 1998) at [[Johns Hopkins University]], and is now University Professor. During that time he also held the position of Director General of the [[European Southern Observatory]] (ESO) (1993&amp;amp;ndash;1999). He is currently [[principal investigator]] for the Chandra Deep Field-South project with [[NASA]]&amp;apos;s [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]].
