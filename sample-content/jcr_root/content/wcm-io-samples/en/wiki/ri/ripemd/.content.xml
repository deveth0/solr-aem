        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;RIPEMD&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[RACE (Europe)|RACE]] Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a family of [[message]] [[digest]] ([[cryptographic hash functions]]) developed in [[Leuven|Leuven, Belgium]], by [[Hans Dobbertin]], [[Antoon Bosselaers]] and [[Bart Preneel]] at the [[COSIC]] research group at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], and first published in 1996. RIPEMD was based upon the design principles used in [[MD4]], and is similar in performance to the more popular [[SHA-1]].

RIPEMD-160 is an improved, 160-bit version of the original RIPEMD, and the most common version in the family. RIPEMD-160 was designed in the open academic community, in contrast to the [[NSA]] designed [[SHA-1]] and [[SHA-2]] algorithms. On the other hand, RIPEMD-160 appears to be used somewhat less frequently than SHA-1, which may have caused it to be less scrutinized than SHA. RIPEMD-160 is not known to be constrained by any patents.

As well as 160-bit, there also exist 128, 256 and 320-bit versions of this algorithm, called RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-256, and RIPEMD-320, respectively.  The 128-bit version was intended only as a drop-in replacement for the original RIPEMD, which was also 128-bit, and which had been found to have questionable security.  The 256 and 320-bit versions diminish only the chance of accidental [[hash collision|collision]], and don&amp;apos;t have higher levels of security (against [[preimage attacks]]) as compared to, respectively, RIPEMD-128 and RIPEMD-160.

In August 2004, a collision was reported for the original RIPEMD.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

==RIPEMD-160 hashes==
The 160-bit RIPEMD-160 hashes (also termed RIPE &amp;apos;&amp;apos;message digests&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) are typically represented as 40-digit [[hexadecimal]] numbers.  The following demonstrates a 43-byte [[ASCII]] input and the corresponding RIPEMD-160 hash:

  RIPEMD-160(&amp;quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&amp;quot;) =
  37f332f68db77bd9d7edd4969571ad671cf9dd3b&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt;

Even a small change in the message will (with overwhelming probability) result in a completely different hash, e.g. changing &amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;d&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;c&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt;:

  RIPEMD-160(&amp;quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;c&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;og&amp;quot;) =
  132072df690933835eb8b6ad0b77e7b6f14acad7

The hash of a zero-length string is:

  RIPEMD-160(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;) =
  9c1185a5c5e9fc54612808977ee8f548b2258d31
