&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rideau Street&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (French: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rue Rideau&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a major street in downtown [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] and one of Ottawa&amp;apos;s oldest and most famous streets running from [[Wellington Street, Ottawa|Wellington Street]] in the west to  [[Montreal Road]] in the east where it connects to the [[Vanier, Ontario|Vanier]] district. Rideau Street is home to the [[ChÃ¢teau Laurier]], the [[Rideau Centre]] and the [[Government Conference Centre]] (Ottawa&amp;apos;s former central train station).  Along with [[Wellington Street (Ottawa)|Wellington Street]] and [[Sussex Drive]] it was among the first streets in Ottawa to be host to businesses; it was created with the founding of the early [[Bytown|town]].  The [[Plaza Bridge (Ottawa)|Plaza Bridge]] by the [[Rideau Canal]] is at its westmost point and the [[Cummings Bridge]] is at its eastmost point.

For many years, Rideau Street was one of Ottawa&amp;apos;s primary retail thoroughfares, containing department stores such as [[Freimans]], [[Charles Ogilvy Limited]], [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]], [[Caplan&amp;apos;s]] and the Metropolitan.  Although the local department stores are gone, Rideau Street still features [[The Bay]] department store, the [[Rideau Centre]] shopping mall, and the street is adjacent to shops of the [[Byward Market]].  The street had been designated [[Ontario Highway 17B|Highway 17B]] before the Ontario government discontinued it in 1998.

To the north of Rideau, east of [[King Edward Avenue (Ottawa)|King Edward Avenue]] is the traditional [[Lower Town]] district of Ottawa, a residential area which in the past was predominantly [[Franco-Ontarian|Francophone]], but now has one of Ottawa&amp;apos;s largest immigrant populations, notably including many Francophone Africans and [[Somali people|Somalis]]. North of Rideau and west of King Edward is the commercial [[Byward Market]] area.

To the south of Rideau Street is the [[Sandy Hill, Ottawa|Sandy Hill]] neighbourhood, with its mix of [[List of Ottawa embassies|embassies]], older houses, low- and high-rise apartment buildings, and student housing.
