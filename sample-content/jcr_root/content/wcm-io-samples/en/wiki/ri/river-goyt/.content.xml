The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;River Goyt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[river]] in [[North West England]]. It is one of the [[tributary|tributaries]] of the [[River Mersey]].
{{Coord|53.41420|-2.15689|display=title|format=dms}}

==Course==
The Goyt [[source (river)|rises]] on the moors of [[Axe Edge]], near the [[River Dane]] and the [[Cat and Fiddle Inn]]. The area is known as the [[Upper Goyt Valley]]. The old [[Cat and Fiddle Road]] from [[Buxton]] to [[Macclesfield]] crosses the river just as it turns northwards to flow down its well-known valley.  The river then flows under Derbyshire Bridge, which was the old boundary between [[Derbyshire]] and [[Cheshire]]. Later it reaches an old [[packhorse bridge]] that was moved when [[Errwood reservoir]] was built in the 1960s (see photo below). Further downstream there is another [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]], the [[Fernilee reservoir]]. The original line of the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]] can be seen near this point.

The Goyt then passes through [[Taxal]] and [[Horwich End]] where it is joined by the [[Todd Brook]]. Thereafter it passes through [[Whaley Bridge]], [[New Mills]] (where it is joined by the [[River Sett]]) and [[Marple Bridge]]. Having been joined by the [[River Etherow]], the Goyt joins the [[River Tame, Greater Manchester|River Tame]] at [[Stockport]], forming the [[River Mersey]].
