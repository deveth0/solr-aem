        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Creek mythology&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is related to an [[American Indians in the United States|American Indian]] Creek people who are originally from the [[Southern United States|southeastern United States]], also known by their original name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Muscogee&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Muskogee&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), the name they use to identify themselves today.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Transcribed documents&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://anpa.ualr.edu/digital_library/Additional%20Texts%20-%20Yuchi%20.htm Transcribed documents] Sequoyah Research Center and the American Native Press Archives&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mvskoke&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is their name in traditional spelling. Modern Muscogees live primarily in [[Oklahoma]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Florida]]. Their language, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Creek language|Mvskoke]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a member of the Creek branch of the [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean language family]]. The [[Seminole (tribe)|Seminole]] are close kin to the Muscogee and speak a Creek language as well. The Creeks were considered one of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]]. After the Creek War many of the Creeks escaped to Florida to create the Seminole.

==History==
[[File:Rogan plate 1 birdman HRoe 2012.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Illustration of a [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|S.E.C.C. Falcon Dancer]] based on a [[Rogan plate]] from [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah]] in northern Georgia]]

The early historic Creeks were probably descendants of the [[Mississippian culture]] peoples who lived along the [[Tennessee River]], in what is now modern [[Tennessee]]&amp;lt;ref name=Finger_2001&amp;gt;{{cite book | last = Finger | first = John R. | title = Tennessee Frontiers: Three Regions in Transition | pages = 19 | publisher = Indiana University Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-253-33985-5}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and Alabama, and possibly related to the [[Utinahica]] of southern Georgia. More of a loose confederacy than a single tribe, the Muscogee lived in autonomous villages in river valleys throughout what are today the states of Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama and consisted of many ethnic groups speaking several distinct languages, such as the [[Hitchiti]], [[Alabama (tribe)|Alabama]], and [[Coushatta]]. Those who lived along the [[Ocmulgee River]] and the [[Oconee River]] were called &amp;quot;Creek Indians&amp;quot; by British traders from [[South Carolina]]; eventually the name was applied to all of the various natives of Creek towns becoming increasingly divided between the Lower Towns of the Georgia frontier on the [[Chattahoochee River]], Ocmulgee River, and [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]] and the Upper Towns of the [[Alabama River]] Valley.

The Lower Towns included Coweta, Cusseta (Kasihta, [[Cofitachequi]]), Upper Chehaw ([[Chiaha]]), Hitchiti, Oconee, Ocmulgee, Okawaigi, [[Apalachee]], [[Yamasee]] (Altamaha), Ocfuskee, Sawokli, and Tamali. The Upper Towns included Tuckabatchee, [[Abihka]], [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]] (Kusa; the dominant people of [[East Tennessee]] and [[North Georgia]] during the Spanish explorations), Itawa (original inhabitants of the [[Etowah Indian Mounds]]), Hothliwahi (Ullibahali), Hilibi, Eufaula, Wakokai, Atasi, [[Alibamu]], Coushatta (Koasati; they had absorbed the Kaski/Casqui and the [[Toqua (Tennessee)|Tali]]), and Tuskegee (&amp;quot;Napochi&amp;quot; in the de Luna chronicles).

Cusseta (Kasihta) and Coweta are the two principal towns of the Creek Nation to this day. Traditionally the Cusseta and Coweta bands are considered the earliest members of the Creek Nation.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Transcribed documents&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Creation==

The Creek believe that the world was originally entirely underwater. The only land was a hill, called [[Nunne Chaha]], and on the hill was a house, wherein lived [[Esaugetuh Emissee]] (&amp;quot;master of breath&amp;quot;). He created humanity from the clay on the hill.

The Creek also venerated the Horned Serpent [[Sint Holo]], who appeared to suitably wise young men.

In the underworld, there was only chaos and odd creatures. Master of Breath created Brother Moon and Sister Sun, as well as the four directions to hold up the world.

The first people were the offspring of Sister Sun and the Horned Serpent. These first two Creeks were Lucky Hunter and Corn Woman, denoting their respective roles in Creek Society.

[[Hisagita-imisi]] (meaning &amp;quot;preserver of breath&amp;quot;; also [[Hisakitaimisi]]) was the supreme god, a [[solar deity]]. He is also called [[Ibofanga]] (&amp;quot;the one who is sitting above (us)&amp;quot;).
