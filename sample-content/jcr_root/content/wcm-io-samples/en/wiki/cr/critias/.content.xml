&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Critias&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Κριτίας}} &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kritias&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 460 BC – 403 BC) was an [[Classical Athens|ancient Athenian]] political figure and author.  Born in Athens, Critias was the son of Callaeschrus and a first cousin of [[Plato]]&amp;apos;s mother [[Perictione]], and became a leading and violent member of the [[Thirty Tyrants]]. He was an associate of [[Socrates]], a fact that did not endear Socrates to the Athenian public.

He was noted in his day for his tragedies, elegies and prose works. Some, like [[Sextus Empiricus]], believe that Critias wrote the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sisyphus fragment]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; others, however, attribute it to [[Euripides]].

==Life==
After the fall of Athens to the [[Sparta]]ns, Critias, as one of the Thirty Tyrants, blacklisted many of its citizens. Most of his prisoners were executed and their wealth was confiscated.

Critias was killed in a battle near [[Piraeus]], the port of Athens, between a band of pro-democracy Athenian exiles led by [[Thrasybulus]] and members and supporters of the Thirty, aided by the Spartan garrison. In the battle, the exiles put the oligarchic forces to flight, ending the rule of the Thirty.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Buck, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thrasybulus and the Athenian Democracy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 71–79&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Xenophon, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hellenica&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[s:Hellenica/Book 2/Chapter 4|2.4]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

According to [[Polybius]], he asserted that &amp;quot;religion was a deliberate imposture devised by some cunning man for political ends.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Polybius: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Rise Of The Roman Empire]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Page 25, Penguin, 1979.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Plato&amp;apos;s description==
Critias appears as a character in [[Plato]]&amp;apos;s dialogues &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and, according to [[Diogenes Laërtius]], was Plato&amp;apos;s great-uncle.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Diogenes Laërtius, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, III:1&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The Critias character in Plato&amp;apos;s dialogues &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is often identified as the son of Callaeschrus &amp;amp;ndash; but not by Plato. Given the old age of the Critias in these two dialogues, he may be the grandfather of the son of Callaeschrus.
