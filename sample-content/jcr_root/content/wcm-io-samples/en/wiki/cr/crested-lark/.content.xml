The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Crested Lark&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Galerida cristata&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) breeds across most of [[temperate]] [[Eurasia]] from [[Portugal]] to northeast [[China]] and eastern [[India]], and in [[Africa]] south to [[Niger]]. It is [[bird migration|non-migratory]], and the sedentary nature of this species is illustrated by the fact that it is only a very rare vagrant to [[Great Britain]], despite breeding as close as northern [[France]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Hayman, Peter and Hume, Rob &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The complete guide to the bird life of Britain and Europe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Bounty Books, 2004, pp. 185 &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

This is a common bird of dry, open country and is often seen by roadsides or in cereal fields, although it is also found occupying small, sandy patches by railways, docks and airfields.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Hayman, Peter and Hume, Rob &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The complete guide to the bird life of Britain and Europe&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Bounty Books, 2004&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It nests on the ground, laying three to five [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s which hatch after 11-13 days. The chicks move off after 9 days and take flight after reaching 15-16 days old. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Hayman, Peter and Hume, Rob &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The complete guide to the bird life of Britain and Europe&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Bounty Books, 2004&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

This is a smallish [[lark]], slightly larger and plumper than the [[Skylark]]. It is distinguishable from many of the other 81 species of larks by the crest of feathers that rise up in territorial or courtship displays and when singing.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Dr Francois Vuillemier &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Animal&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Dorling Kindersley, London, 2001 pp.342&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In flight it shows reddish underwings. The body is mainly dark-streaked grey above and whitish below. The song is melodious and varied, with mournful whistles and mimicry included.
Some care must be taken to distinguish this lark, which has many [[subspecies]], from its close relatives in areas where they also occur. In the west of its range the [[Thekla Lark]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Galerida theklae&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is very similar, as is the [[Malabar Lark]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Galerida malabarica&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in western [[India]].

==Cultural significance==
[[Francis of Assisi]] considered the Crested Lark a bird of special significance, based on similarities he perceived between it and the life of the Friars Minor: its plain earth-colored plumage and hood, its humility (&amp;quot;for it goes willingly along the wayside and finds a grain of corn for itself&amp;quot;), and its time spent in song.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Edward A. Armstrong, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Saint Francis, Nature Mystic: The Derivation and Significance of the Nature Stories in the Franciscan Legend&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1973, pp. 90-[http://books.google.com/books?id=ReqGZO4nfTYC&amp;amp;lpg=PA91&amp;amp;vq=Galerida&amp;amp;pg=PA91#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=Galerida&amp;amp;f=false 91]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
