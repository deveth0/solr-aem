&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Croxden Abbey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Cistercian]] [[abbey]] at [[Croxden]], [[Staffordshire]], England.

In 1179, [[Bertram de Verdun]], the [[lord of the manor]] of Croxden, endowed a site for a new abbey, and 12 monks arrived from the [[Savigniac]] Cistercian mother house of [[Aunay-sur-Odon]] in [[Normandy]] to build the new abbey over the next 50 years. It was known as the &amp;quot;Abbey of the Vale of St. Mary at Croxden&amp;quot;. The monks made a living from breeding sheep. The Abbey was consecrated in 1253.

The abbey lasted for 350 years until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. In September 1538, the abbot and the twelve remaining monks surrendered the abbey.

The site is privately owned and the ruins are in the care of [[English Heritage]].

[[Charles Lynam]] (1829â€“1921) was an architect and amateur archaeologist from Leek. He worked out the ground plan of the abbey and published his findings in 1911 as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Abbey of St. Mary, Croxden, Staffordshire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
