The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Croaking Cisticola&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cisticola natalensis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is an [[Old World warbler]] in the genus &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Cisticola]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This genus is sometimes split off with various other southern warbler genera and given family status as the Cisticolidae.

The Croaking Cisticola is a resident breeder in [[Africa]] south of the [[Sahara]]. It is a very small insectivorous [[bird]].

These small [[passerine]]s are found in rank grassland habitats, often near swamps or water. Male cisticolas are polygamous; the female builds a discreet nest deep in the grasses, often binding living leaves into the soft fabric of [[felted]] plant-down, cobwebs, and grass. The Croaking Cisticola&amp;apos;s nest is a ball shape with a side entrance; 2-4 eggs are laid.

This is the largest cisticola.  This warbler is grey-brown above, heavily streaked with black. The underparts are whitish, and the tail is broad, pale-tipped and flicked frequently. It has a chestnut wing-panel and a heavy bill.

It is very similar to other members of its genus. It is best distinguished from its many African relatives by its size and froglike croaking &amp;apos;&amp;apos;breep-breep&amp;apos;&amp;apos; song. The song is always the easiest identification criterion for this genus.

These birds are more easily heard than seen, and because of their small size (about 14&amp;amp;nbsp;cm) not always easy to recognise, particularly outside the breeding season when they seldom emerge from their grasses.
