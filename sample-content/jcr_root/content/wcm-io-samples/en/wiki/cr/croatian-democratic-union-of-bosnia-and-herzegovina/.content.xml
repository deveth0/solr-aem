The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska demokratska zajednica Bosne i Hercegovine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;HDZ BiH}}) is a [[political party]] of [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It is an observer member of the [[European People&amp;apos;s Party]] (EPP).

The party was formed on 18 August 1990, at the 1st party convention held in [[Sarajevo]], and it has participated in all multi-party elections held in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1991. It regularly won the support of the Croatian electorate up to 2000, and participated in the government. It returned to power in 2002, where it remained until 2010.

At the legislative [[elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina|election]] of October 2002, the party was part of the [[Croatian Coalition (2002)|Croatian Coalition]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Koalicija&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), that won 9.5% of the popular vote and 5 out of 42 seats in the [[House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and 16 out of 140 seats in the House of Representatives of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

In 2006 the party joined the [[Croatian National Assembly]] with the [[Croatian Party of Rights of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Croatian People&amp;apos;s Union]].

The party has had two splinter factions so far:
* [[New Croatian Initiative]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nova hrvatska inicijativa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, NHI), led by [[Krešimir Zubak]]
* [[Croatian Democratic Union 1990]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hrvatska demokratska zajednica 1990&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, HDZ 1990), led by [[Božo Ljubić]]
