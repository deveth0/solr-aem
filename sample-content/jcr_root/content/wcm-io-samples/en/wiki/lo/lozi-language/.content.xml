&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lozi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;siLozi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rozi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a [[Bantu language]] of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] language family within the [[Sotho languages]] branch of [[Guthrie_classification_of_Bantu_languages#Zone_S|Zone S (S.30)]], that is spoken by the [[Lozi people]], primarily in southwestern [[Zambia]] and in surrounding countries. This language is most closely related to [[Northern Sotho]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sesotho sa Leboa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), [[Tswana language|Tswana]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Setswana&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), [[Kgalagadi language|Kgalagari]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;SheKgalagari&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and [[Sotho language|Sotho]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sesotho&amp;apos;&amp;apos;/Southern Sotho). Lozi and its dialects are spoken and understood by approximately six percent of the population of Zambia. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Silozi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the [[endonym|autoglottonym]]  or name of the language used by its native speakers as defined by the [[United Nations]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lozi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the [[exonym|heteroglottonym]].

The Lozi language developed from a mixture of two languages: [[Luyana language|Luyana]] and [[Kololo language|Kololo]]. The Luyana people originally migrated south from the [[Luba]]-[[Lunda]] empire in the [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] area of the [[Congo River]] basin, either  late in the 17th century or early in the 18th century. The language they spoke, therefore, was closely related to Luba and Lunda. They settled on the floodplains of the upper [[Zambezi River]] in what is now western [[Zambia]] and developed a kingdom, [[Barotseland]], and also gave their name to the [[Barotse Floodplain]] or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bulozi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The Kololo were a Sotho people who used to live in what is now Lesotho. The Kololo were forced to flee from [[Shaka]] Zulu&amp;apos;s [[Mfecane]] during the 1830s. Using tactics they had copied from the Zulu armies, the Kololo conquered the Luyana on the Zambezi floodplains and imposed their rule and language. However, by 1864 the indigenous population revolted and overthrew the Kololo. By that time, the Luyana language had been largely forgotten; the new hybrid language is called Lozi or Silozi and is closer to [[Sesotho]] than to any other neighbouring languages in Zambia.

Lozi is also spoken in [[Zimbabwe]], [[Botswana]], and [[Namibia]] ([[Caprivi Region]]).
