&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1795–1840) was a [[France|French]] [[chess master]], possibly the strongest player in the early 19th century.

== Early life ==

La Bourdonnais was born on the island of La [[Réunion]] in the Indian Ocean in 1795. He learned chess in 1814 and began to take the game seriously in 1818, when he regularly played at the [[Café de la Régence]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The Oxford Companion to Chess – David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld (1992) p. 56&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He took lessons from [[Jacques François Mouret]], his first teacher,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.it/books?id=gzICAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA1&amp;amp;dq=&amp;amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=mouret&amp;amp;f=false &amp;apos;&amp;apos;La Palamède&amp;apos;&amp;apos; edited by St. Amaint (1847) p. 211]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and within two years he became one of the best players of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Café&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

La Bourdonnais was forced to earn his living as a professional chess player after squandering his fortune on ill-advised land deals.

== Unofficial World Chess Champion ==
{{main|La Bourdonnais - McDonnell chess matches}}
La Bourdonnais was considered to be the unofficial [[World Chess Champion]] (there was no official title at the time) from 1821—when he became able to beat his chess teacher [[Alexandre Deschapelles]]—until his death in 1840.  The most famous match series, indeed considered as the world championship, was the series against [[Alexander McDonnell]] in 1834.

== Death ==
He died penniless in London in 1840, having been forced to sell all of his possessions, including his clothes, to satisfy his creditors. [[George Walker (chess player)|George Walker]] arranged to have him buried just a stone&amp;apos;s throw away from his old rival [[Alexander McDonnell]] in London&amp;apos;s [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Philip W. Sergeant]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Century of British Chess&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, David McKay, 1934, p. 39.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book
