&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Loudwater&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in the parish of [[Chepping Wycombe]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].  It is located in the valley to the east of the main [[town]], on the [[A40 road|A40]] London Road.

== History ==

The hamlet name refers to the [[River Wye, Buckinghamshire|River Wye]] nearby, that also flows through [[High Wycombe]].  Its literal meaning is &amp;apos;noisy water&amp;apos;.  In [[Manorialism|manorial]] records in 1241 the hamlet was referred to as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;La Ludewatere&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The brick built St Peter&amp;apos;s Church dates from 1788 with a gothic style [[chancel]] added in 1903 and further improvements in recent years, including new windows. On the London Road there is a Victorian mansion called Burleighfield House that was once the studio of the stained glass designer [[Patrick Reyntiens]].

There was once a [[blotting paper]] mill in the valley and Loudwater had its own railway station on the [[Wycombe Railway]] that opened in 1854 and closed in 1970.

Today there is little to distinguish the hamlet from the [[urban sprawl]] of High Wycombe, though it is signed along the London Road. A 1744 [[milestone]] can still be seen and there is also still a traditional village pub &amp;apos;The Derehams Inn&amp;apos; in Derehams Lane.

== Features==

Loudwater is home to several retail and industrial concerns - a large [[Tesco]] supermarket, the world&amp;apos;s largest envelope supplier,an industrial estate, a small retail park, a [[Brewers Fayre]] [[motel]] and also the office of the local newspaper, the [[Bucks Free Press]]. The [[M40 motorway]] crosses over the valley close to the village, and facilitates the eastbound only Junction 3, signposted as &amp;apos;Wycombe East&amp;apos;.

Loudwater was once served by the High Wycombe to Bourne End railway line, the station being situated at the bottom of Treadaway Hill. The line and station closed in 1970.
