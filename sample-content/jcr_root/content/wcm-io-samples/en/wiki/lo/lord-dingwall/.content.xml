        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lord Dingwall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a title in the [[Peerage of Scotland]]. It was created in 1609 for Sir Richard Preston, with remainder to his heirs whatsoever. In 1619 he was further honoured when he was made Baron Dunmore and [[Earl of Desmond]] in the [[Peerage of Ireland]], with remainder to heirs male. On his death in 1628 the Irish titles became extinct while he was succeeded in the Scottish lordship by his daughter Elizabeth, the second Lady Dingwall. She was the wife of [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde]]. Their eldest son [[Thomas Butler, 6th Earl of Ossory|Thomas Butler, Earl of Ossory]], was summoned by writ to the English Parliament as Baron Butler, of Moore Park, in 1666. However, he predeceased his parents who were both succeeded by their grandson, the second Duke and third Lord Dingwall. He had already succeeded his father as second Baron Butler. However, the Duke was [[attainted]] in 1715 and his titles forfeited. In 1871, [[Francis Cowper, 7th Earl Cowper]], managed to obtain a reversal of the attainder of the lordship of Dingwall and barony of Butler and became the fourth Lord Dingwall and third Baron Butler. He was the great-great-great-grandson of Henrietta Butler, Countess of Grantham (wife of [[Henry de Nassau d&amp;apos;Auverquerque, 1st Earl of Grantham]]), second daughter of [[Thomas Butler, 6th Earl of Ossory|Thomas Butler, Earl of Ossory and 1st Baron Butler]], whose second daughter Lady Henrietta de Nassau d&amp;apos;Auverquerque married [[William Clavering-Cowper, 2nd Earl Cowper]]. In 1880 he also succeeded his mother as eighth Baron Lucas of Crudwell. For later history of the lordship of Dingwall and barony of Butler, see the [[Baron Lucas of Crudwell]].
