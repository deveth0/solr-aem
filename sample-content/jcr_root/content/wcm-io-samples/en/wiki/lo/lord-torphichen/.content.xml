&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lord Torphichen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a title in the [[Peerage of Scotland]]. It was created by Queen Mary in 1564 for [[James Sandilands, 1st Lord Torphichen|Sir James Sandilands]] (to whom she was related), with remainder to his heirs and assigns whatsoever.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Lodge, Edmund, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Genealogy of the Existing British Peerage and Baronetage&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Oxford University, 1869, P. 541&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=iwtVse6yazQC&amp;amp;pg=PA587&amp;amp;dq=created+24+Jan.+1563-4,+lord+torphichen&amp;amp;hl= Debrett&amp;apos;s Peerage at Google Books.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Sandilands had previously served as [[Preceptor]] of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes, and of Malta]] in [[Scotland]], and took the title from the [[Torphichen Preceptory]] in [[West Lothian]].  He was succeeded by his great-nephew James Sandilands (who was also the current Feudal Baron of Calder). Thereafter the two titles of Lord Torphichen and Feudal Baron of Calder were conjoined, and all later lords were descended from the second lord Torphichen. His great-grandson, the seventh Lord, was a strong supporter of the [[Acts of Union 1707|union with England]].  His grandson, the ninth Lord, and great-great-grandson, the twelfth Lord, sat in the [[British House of Lords|House of Lords]] as [[Representative peer|Scottish Representative Peers]]. Currently the title is held by the latter&amp;apos;s great-grandson, the fifteenth Lord, who succeeded his father in 1975. He is Chief of [[Clan Sandilands]] and also holds the feudal title of Baron of Calder, dating to the 14th century.

The title of the [[lordship of Parliament]], Torphichen, is pronounced &amp;quot;Tor-fikken&amp;quot;.

The ancestral seat of the Sandilands family is Calder House, historically called Caldour Castle, in [[Mid Calder]], [[West Lothian]].
