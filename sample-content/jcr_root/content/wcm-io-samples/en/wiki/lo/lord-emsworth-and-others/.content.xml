&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lord Emsworth and Others&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a collection of nine short stories by [[P. G. Wodehouse]], first published in the United Kingdom on March 19, 1937 by [[Herbert Jenkins Ltd|Herbert Jenkins]], London; it was not published in the United States. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Crime Wave at Blandings&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was published on June 25, 1937 by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday, Doran]], New York, is a very different collection, sharing only three of its seven titles with the UK book. [[Penguin Books]] published a UK edition of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Crime Wave at Blandings&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1966. The stories in both books had all previously appeared in both British and American magazines.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lord Emsworth and Others&amp;apos;&amp;apos; contains one story set at [[Blandings Castle]], three golf stories narrated by the [[Oldest Member]], one  story featuring [[Drones Club]] member Freddie Widgeon, one tale narrated by [[Mr Mulliner]],  and three [[Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge|Ukridge]] stories.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Crime Wave at Blandings&amp;apos;&amp;apos; contains the Blandings, Mulliner and Freddie Widgeon stories, to which were added two more Drones stories, a [[Bingo Little]] story, and a [[novella]], &amp;quot;The Medicine Girl&amp;quot;, which had been published separately in the UK as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Doctor Sally]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1932).

The three short stories which replaced them in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Crime Wave at Blandings&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were &amp;quot;[[Tried in the Furnace]]&amp;quot; (from the UK edition of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Young Men in Spats&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), and &amp;quot;[[All&amp;apos;s Well With Bingo]]&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;[[Romance at Droitgate Spa]]&amp;quot; (both of which appeared in the UK edition of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eggs, Beans and Crumpets&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).
