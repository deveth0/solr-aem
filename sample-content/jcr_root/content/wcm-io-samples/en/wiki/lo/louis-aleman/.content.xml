        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Louis Aleman&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (c. 1390 â€“ September 16, 1450) was a [[France|French]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]].

==Biography==
Aleman was born of a noble family at the castle of [[Arbent]] near [[Bugey]]. A relative was the [[Papal Chamberlain]].{{sfn|Thurston|1913}} He was successively [[bishop of Maguelonne]] (1418), [[archbishop of Arles]] (1423) and [[Cardinal Priest of S. Cecilia]] (1426).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Aleman was a prominent member of the [[council of Basel]], and, together with Cardinal [[Julian Cesarini]], led the party which maintained the supremacy of general councils over the pope&amp;apos;s authority.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1440 Aleman obtained the support of the emperor [[Sigismund of Luxemburg|Sigismund]] and of the duke of [[Milan]] to his views, and proclaiming the deposition of [[Pope Eugene IV]], placed the tiara upon the head of [[Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy]] (henceforward known as Antipope Felix V).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Eugene retorted by excommunicating the antipope and depriving Aleman of all his ecclesiastical dignities. In order to make an end of the [[Western Schism|schism]], Felix V finally abdicated on Aleman&amp;apos;s advice, and [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]], who had succeeded in 1447, restored the cardinal to all his honours and employed him as legate to [[Germany]] in 1449.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

On his return he retired to his diocese of Arles, where he devoted himself zealously to the instruction of his people.  He died on September 16, 1450, and was [[beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope Clement VII]] in 1527.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
