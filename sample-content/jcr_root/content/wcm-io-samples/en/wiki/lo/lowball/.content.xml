&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lowball&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an early type of [[railway signal]] indicating danger/stop.  The ball signal was a light or indicator suspended from a rope, that could move upwards and downwards, held by a weighted ball.  The lowball signal was indicated when the weighted ball, and therefore signal, was at the end of its rope in the low position, indicating stop.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Yoshinori Kon, &amp;quot;The Current Status of Signal Control Systems, and Research and Development&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;JR EAST Technical Review&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Technology and Planning Department
