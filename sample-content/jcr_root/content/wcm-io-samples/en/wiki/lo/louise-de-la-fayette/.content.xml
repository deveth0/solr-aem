        text="&lt;p&gt;[[File:Louise de La Fayette.jpg|thumb|Louise de La Fayette]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Louise Angélique Motier de la Fayette&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (November 8, 1618 &amp;amp;ndash; January 11, 1665) was a French [[courtier]] and close friend of [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis XIII]] who renounced the corruption of his court and entered a [[convent]].

== Life in the royal court ==
Louise was one of the fourteen children of [[Jean Motier de La Fayette, seigneur de Hautefeuille, comte de la Fayette|Jean comte de La Fayette]], and [[Marguerite de Bourbon-Busset]]. She was born in [[Amathay-Vésigneux]].

When Louise became [[Maids of Honour|maid-of-honor]] to [[Anne of Austria]], [[Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu|Cardinal Richelieu]] sought to attract the attention of Louis XIII to her in the hope that she might counterbalance the influence exercised over him by [[Marie de Hautefort]].

However, &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;[t]he hedonism and promiscuity of many courtiers repelled [Louis XIII] and attempts to provide him with a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] failed lamentably.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Miller 1987, p. 126&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Miller 1987, p. 126&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
The affair did not turn out as the minister wished. The King was attracted to Louise because of her innocence and purity,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Miller 1987, p. 126&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; and he did indeed make her the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;confidante&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of his affairs. But when he divulged to her his resentment for the Cardinal, she, far from repeating Louis&amp;apos;s confidences to the minister, set herself to encourage the King in his resistance to Richelieu&amp;apos;s dominion.

She refused, nevertheless, to become Louis&amp;apos;s mistress, and after taking leave of the King in Anne of Austria&amp;apos;s presence, retired to the convent of the Filles de Sainte-Marie in 1637.

Here she was repeatedly visited by Louis, with whom she maintained a correspondence. Richelieu intercepted the letters, and by omissions and falsifications succeeded in destroying their mutual confidence. The cessation of their intercourse was regretted by the queen, who had been reconciled with her husband through the influence of Louise. At the time of her death in January 1665, Mlle de La Fayette was superior of a convent of her order which she had founded at [[Chaillot]].

See &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mémoires de Madame de Motteville&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; [[Victor Cousin]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Madame de Hautefort&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Paris, 1868); L&amp;apos;Abbé Sorin, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Louise-Angle de La Fayette&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Paris, 1893).
