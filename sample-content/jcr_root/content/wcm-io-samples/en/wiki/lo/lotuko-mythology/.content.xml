The [[Lotuko people|Lotuko]] are an ethnic group from [[South Sudan]].

The chief god of the Lotuko is called [[Ajok]]; he is generally seen as kind and benevolent, but can be angered. He once reportedly answered a woman&amp;apos;s prayer for the resurrection of her son.  Her husband, however, was angry and re-killed the child.  According to the Lotuko religion, Ajok was annoyed by his actions and swore to never resurrect any Lotuko again, and in this manner, [[death]] was said to have become permanent.
