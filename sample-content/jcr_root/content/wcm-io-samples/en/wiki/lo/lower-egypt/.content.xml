[[Image:Ancient Egypt map-en.svg|thumb|350px|Map of Lower and Upper Egypt]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lower Egypt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Lang-ar|الدلتا}} &amp;apos;&amp;apos;al-Diltā&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is the northernmost region of [[Egypt]]:  the fertile [[Nile Delta]], between [[Upper Egypt]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] — from El-Aiyat, south of modern-day [[Cairo]], and [[Zawyet Dahshur]].

==Geography==
Today there are two principal channels that the [[Nile]] takes through the [[river]]&amp;apos;s delta: one in the west at [[Rashid]] and one in the east at [[Damietta]].

In ancient times, [[Pliny the Elder]] (N.H. 5.11) said that upon reaching the delta the Nile split into seven branches (from east to west): the [[Pelusium|Pelusiac]], the [[TaDOGnis, Egypt|Tanitic]], the [[Mendes]]ian, the [[Phatnitic]], the [[Sebennytic]], the [[Rosetta|Bolbitine]], and the [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopic]]. Today the delta region is well watered, crisscrossed by channels and canals.

The climate in Lower Egypt is milder than that of [[Upper Egypt]] owing primarily to its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea. Temperatures are less extreme and rainfall is more abundant.

==History==
Lower Egypt was known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ta-Mehu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which means &amp;quot;land of [[papyrus]].&amp;quot; It was divided into twenty districts called [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]]s, the first of which was at [[el-Lisht]]. Because Lower Egypt was mostly undeveloped [[scrubland]], undeveloped for human life and filled with all types of plant life such as grasses and herbs, the organization of the nomes underwent several changes.

The capital of Lower Egypt was [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. Its patron Goddess was the cobra goddess [[Wadjet]]. Lower Egypt was represented by the Low Red Crown &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Deshret]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and its symbols were the papyrus and the bee.
