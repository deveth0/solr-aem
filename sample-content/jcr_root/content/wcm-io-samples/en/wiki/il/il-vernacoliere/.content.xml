&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Il Vernacoliere&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[Italy|Italian]] monthly satirical magazine based in [[Livorno]], [[Tuscany]], founded in 1982 by editor-director [[Mario Cardinali]]. The periodical started to operate as a successor of the pre-existing &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Livornocronaca&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, first issued in 1961. Il Vernacoliere is characterised by its absence of advertising, its satirical style, and for the widespread use of the [[dialect]] of Livorno. It is now distributed throughout Tuscany, in many newsstands of central Italy, and in selected ones in the rest of Italy.

==History==
The magazine traces its roots in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Livornocronaca&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which operated weekly from 1961 to 1969 and which was written in standard [[Italian_language|Italian]]. Livornocronaca was issued twice a month from 1969 to 1972, and eventually only monthly with the subtitle &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Il Vernacoliere&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 1982, the title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Livornocronaca&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was dropped, and the name was changed permanently into &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Il Vernacoliere&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The magazine slowly but steadily gained momentum beyond the borders of the Province of Livorno, and it is now read in most Northern and Central Italy.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Official website history&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vernacoliere.com/vernacoliere/index.php|title=COS&amp;apos;È IL VERNACOLIERE|publisher=Mario Cardinali}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Il Vernacoliere is well known for its popular, raw, heavily irreverent political and social satire, written in the dialect of Livorno or, at the very least, with a distinctive Tuscanian tinge. The magazine features satirical articles, comics, and an editorial note (in standard Italian), with the occasional addition of opinion pieces. Amongst Italian magazines, Il Vernacoliere is notable for having no advertising, covering all its expenses with the sale of the journal and of the associated gadgets. Its famous &amp;apos;&amp;apos;locandine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (in {{lang-en|playbills}}) are saucy showcases of the main articles of the magazine, to be displayed at newsstands. Their text is written by the Director.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Official website history&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

The founder and current Director of Il Vernacoliere is Mario Cardinali. He is also the author of most political satire pieces, written in pure and witty Livorno dialect.  Notable Vernacoliere contributors include [[Federico Maria Sardelli]], Daniele Caluri, Max Greggio, Marco Citi, Ettore Borzacchini, and Andrea Camerini.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Official website history&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

The periodical is considered to be one of the freest magazines currently published in Italy.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;AbruzzeseCastronovo1994&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|author1=Alberto Abruzzese|author2=Valerio Castronovo|author3=Nicola Tranfaglia|title=La stampa italiana nell&amp;apos;età della TV: 1975-1994|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IqgaAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 March 2011|year=1994|publisher=Editori Laterza|page=426|isbn=978-88-420-4509-0}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; According to journalist [[Camillo Langone]], it is an example that, in present-day Italy, satire can be published at a dialectal level only, while not viable in standard Italian.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Langone2001&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|author=Camillo Langone|title=Cari Italiani, vi invidio|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q8IzqAhA1sEC&amp;amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=6 March 2011|year=2001|publisher=Fazi Editore|isbn=978-88-8112-173-1|pages=105–|quote=La satira in Italia è ormai solo provinciale (vedi il Vernacoliere).
