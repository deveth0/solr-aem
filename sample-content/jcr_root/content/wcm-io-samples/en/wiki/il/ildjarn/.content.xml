&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ildjarn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[black metal]] project from [[Norway]] that formed in 1991. Ildjarn recorded music until 1997 but did not officially end until 2005. The man behind Ildjarn was Vidar Vaaer, although some releases were collaborations with a musician known as Nidhogg.  Ildjarn&amp;apos;s music was a very simple and [[low fidelity|lo-fi]] brand of black metal, with most songs composed of basic drum patterns, a couple of riffs, and unintelligible vocals. The band&amp;apos;s style has been compared to [[hardcore punk]] in its simplistic ferocity and short song lengths. Two Ildjarn albums were made entirely on a synthesizer.

Of all the released music, the only Ildjarn song to have its lyrics published was &amp;quot;Eksistensens Jeger&amp;quot;, from the self-titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ildjarn-Nidhogg&amp;apos;&amp;apos; compilation.

In 2006, the band website stated that no more news would be printed, leading to the conclusion that Ildjarn had ended. The title of Ildjarn&amp;apos;s 2005 release, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ildjarn is Dead&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, further supports this conclusion.  Part of Vidar Vaaer&amp;apos;s motivation for ending Ildjarn was due to his 4-track recorder breaking (the same 4-track recorder used during [[Emperor (band)|Emperor&amp;apos;s]] early days as [[Thou Shalt Suffer]]).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.anus.com/metal/about/interviews/ildjarn/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The related band Sort Vokter consisted of Ildjarn, Nidhogg and two other members known as Tvigygre and Heiinghund. They released only one album called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Folkloric Necro Metal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
