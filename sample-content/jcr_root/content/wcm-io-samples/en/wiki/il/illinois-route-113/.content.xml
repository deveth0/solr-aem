&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Illinois Route 113&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a two-lane state road that runs east from [[Illinois Route 47]] north of [[Mazon, Illinois|Mazon]] and east of [[Seneca, Illinois|Seneca]] to [[Illinois Route 17]] in western [[Kankakee, Illinois|Kankakee]], just across the [[Kankakee River]] from [[U.S. Route 45]] and [[U.S. Route 52]]. This is a distance of {{convert|33.95|mi|km|2}}.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;t2&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

== Route description ==
Route 113 begins at a junction with Route 47 in [[Grundy County, Illinois|Grundy County]] north of Mazon. From here, the route heads east through a rural area before passing through [[Coal City, Illinois|Coal City]] and [[Diamond, Illinois|Diamond]]. At the eastern edge of Diamond, Route 113 meets [[Interstate 55]]. Past this junction, the route turns southward, entering [[Braidwood, Illinois|Braidwood]] along Division Street. The highway turns east onto Main Street and intersects [[Illinois Route 129]] and [[Illinois Route 53]] at separate junctions. After leaving Braidwood to the east, Route 113 follows the southern bank of the Kankakee River; [[Illinois Route 102]] parallels this stretch of the route on the northern bank of the river. At [[Custer Park, Illinois|Custer Park]], the route crosses the Wauponsee Glacial Trail. Past Custer Park, the route runs past [[Kankakee River State Park]]. It then meets County Route 20, which crosses the river and connects Route 113 to Route 102.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite map |publisher=[[Illinois Department of Transportation]] |title=General Highway Map: Will County, Illinois |trans_title= |date= |year=2010 |url=http://www.dot.state.il.us/maps/county/will.pdf |scale= |series= |version= |cartography= |page= |pages= |section= |inset= |edition= |location= |language= |format=PDF |isbn= |id= |ref= |accessdate=March 1, 2013 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Past this junction, Route 113 enters [[Kankakee County, Illinois|Kankakee County]].

== History ==
SBI Route 113 was the name of both roads on the north and south sides of the Kankakee River from [[Diamond, Illinois|Diamond]] (between Coal City and Braidwood on [[Interstate 55]]) to Kankakee. In 1940, the route became &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Illinois Route 113N]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Illinois Route 113S]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, with 113N as the northern route and 113S as the southern, with 113S used as the western end to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[U.S. Route 66]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (now Interstate 55). In 1961, Illinois 113S became Illinois Route 113, and 113N was renamed Illinois Route 102.&amp;lt;ref name=n9jig/&amp;gt;
