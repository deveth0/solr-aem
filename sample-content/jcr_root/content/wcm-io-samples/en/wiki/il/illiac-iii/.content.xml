        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ILLIAC III&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a fine-grained [[SIMD]] [[pattern recognition]] computer built by the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] in 1966.

This ILLIAC&amp;apos;s initial task was image processing of bubble chamber experiments used to detect nuclear particles. Later it was used on biological images.

The machine was destroyed in a fire, caused by a [[Variac]] shorting on one of the wooden-top benches, in 1968.  It was rebuilt in the early 1970s, and the core parallel-processing element of the machine, the Pattern Articulation Unit, was successfully implemented.  In spite of this and the productive exploration of other advanced concepts, such as multiple-radix arithmetic, the project was eventually abandoned.

[[Bruce H. McCormick]] was the leader of the project throughout its history.
