&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zwei&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a Japanese  duo formed in 2003 composed of model [[Megumi Ueno]] (born May 24, 1980) on [[Bass guitar|bass]] and Ayumu (born March 30, 1978) on vocals. Ueno models for Japanese punk brand [[SeXpoT RevenGe]] and has appeared in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kera&amp;apos;&amp;apos; magazine.

==Biography==
Megu and Ayumu started their career as Zwei in 2004 under [[VAP (company)|VAP, Inc.]] They released their debut single &amp;quot;Movie Star&amp;quot; in May 2004. Since then, the band started developing a techno-rock style with some similarities with [[Depeche Mode]]. In October 2004, they released their debut album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pretty Queen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The following year, they continued releasing singles, and a second album, but in general, the sales of both the albums and the singles was limited. Probably the most popular song of this era was &amp;quot;Dragon&amp;quot;, released in July 2005.

In 2007, Zwei officially left VAP and signed on with [[Universal Music Group]]. However, in 2010, the band left Universal and moved to [[5pb.]]. They started singing songs for some of the video games developed by the same company. As a result, the popularity of the band started growing moderately. In 2012, they sung the opening theme for the [[visual novel]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Robotics;Notes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, developed by 5pb. too. The band also sings the opening theme for the [[anime]] adaptation of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Robotics;Notes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 2013, the duo announced they would be releasing their first album in 8 years, titled &amp;quot;Re:Set,&amp;quot; on April 24th.
