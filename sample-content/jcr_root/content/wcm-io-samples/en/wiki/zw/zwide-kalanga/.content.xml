        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zwide kaLanga&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1758–1825) was the [[Tribal chief|chief]] of the [[Ndwandwe]] (Nxumalo) clan from about 1805 to around 1820.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | title=King ZWIDE kaLanga | work=Rootsweb.com | url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~royalty/africa/i314.html#I314 | accessdate=2006-06-04}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was the son of [[Langa KaXaba]], a Ndwandwe Chieftain. Legend has it that Zwide&amp;apos;s mother, Queen Ntombazi was a [[sangoma]].

== Political life ==
Around the time Zwide became King, the Ndwandwe were growing in military power.  Ambitious in expanding Ndwandwe supremacy, Zwide was a prominent rival chieftain to King [[Dingiswayo]] of the [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]] and his famous general and protégé, Prince Shaka, heir to the Zulu throne.

== Military actions ==
Zwide sought to expand his borders, and in 1818 he destroyed the power of the [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]] Kingdom, after he had King Dingiswayo killed.  He also had a battle with the young Zulu clan at the [[Battle of Gqokli Hill]].

He destroyed and overran the neighbouring [[Khumalo clan|Khumalo]] Kingdom and executed their King [[Matshobana]] KaMangete.  Matshobana&amp;apos;s son and heir [[Mzilikazi]] escaped from the Ndwandwe and sought refuge with [[Shaka]], who had reformed the remnant Mthethwa clan under his rule.

Knowing this, Zwide planned to destroy the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu Empire]] to secure Ndwandwe domination of Zululand.  In 1820, he led his army into battle against the Zulu at the [[Battle of Mhlatuze River]].  His forces were caught crossing halfway across the [[Mhlatuze River]] when the Zulu forces attacked, and the Ndwandwe army was scattered.  Zwide escaped with a remnant of his clan across the [[Pongola River]].

After Zwide and his clansmen escaped, the Zulu attacked the rest of his people, killing many at   Mome Gorge, a desolate place.  The Zulu attacked the Ndwandwe capital, Kwa[[Nongoma]].  The Zulu victory was the beginning of the [[Mfecane]] or the scattering.  Zwide&amp;apos;s generals fled north, where they established their own Kingdoms, such as the [[Shangane Kingdom]] in Gaza, formed by General [[Soshangane]].
