The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Leie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]) or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lys&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[French language|French]]) is a [[river]] in [[France]] and [[Belgium]], and a [[left tributary]] of the [[Scheldt]]. Its source is in [[Pas-de-Calais]], France, and it flows into the river [[Scheldt]] in [[Ghent]], Belgium. Its total length is {{convert|202|km|mi}}.

It is a very polluted river due to the high density of population and industry in the North of France and in Belgium. Historically, the Lys valley was known for the spinning and weaving of [[flax]]. The region of the Leie (between Deinze and Ghent) used to be known as a favourite place for numerous painters in the first half of the twentieth century.

The source of the Lys is in the village [[Lisbourg]], east of [[Fruges]], in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] department of France. It flows generally northeast through the following [[departments of France]], [[provinces of Belgium]] and towns:

*[[Pas-de-Calais]] (F): [[Thérouanne]], [[Aire-sur-la-Lys]]
*[[Nord (département)|Nord]] (F): [[Merville, Nord|Merville]], [[Armentières]], [[Halluin]]
*[[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] (B): [[Comines-Warneton]]
*[[West Flanders]] (B): [[Menen]], [[Kortrijk]], [[Waregem]], [[Wervik]]
*[[East Flanders]] (B): [[Zulte]], [[Deinze]], [[Ghent]]

The river Lys was the location of three battles between the Allies and the German Army. During the [[First World War]] in 1918 the location was the scene of the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|First Battle of the Lys]], which was part of the German Spring Offensive, and later that year of the Second Battle of the Lys, which was part of the Allies&amp;apos; [[Hundred Days Offensive]]. During the [[Second World War]] the [[Battle of the Lys (1940)|Battle of the Lys]] was part of the 1940 Nazi-German offensive in Flanders towards the English Channel.
