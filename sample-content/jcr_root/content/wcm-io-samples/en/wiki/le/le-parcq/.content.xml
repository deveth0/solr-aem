==History==
The establishment of Le Parcq dates from the founding of a [[castle]] (on the current site of [[Vieil-Hesdin]]) by [[Baldwin I of Constantinople]] or Baudouin IX, [[Count of Flanders]] in about 1208. It was a wooden enclosure surrounded by walls within which wild animals were placed in large numbers.

In 1329, [[portcullis]]es were installed at all the gates of the castle. Unfortunately, in 1335, [[Edward III]] destroyed the castle just before the start of the [[Hundred Years War]]. This destruction was continued in 1337 by [[Charles III of Navarre]] who brought down the walls. In 1395, [[Philip II of Burgundy]] restored the castle walls.

Several people were employed daily to feed the animals in the park which also had a vast [[falconry]] centre and two fishing lakes. The park totalled 940 [[hectare]]s with a perimeter of approximately 8 miles (13&amp;amp;nbsp;km), opening onto the outside world by many gates.

After the destruction of [[Vieil-Hesdin]] in) 1553 by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the park was, at the initiative of [[Philippe V of France]], made the parkland available to those displaced by the fall of the old town, who wished to build new homes on the parkland. To attract more people, tax benefits were given, on February 25, 1586 to all those moving into the area.

Thus, the park became a [[village]], originally known as Parc-lès-Hesdin. The municipality was formally recognized in 1670 and on February 8, 1816, Le Parcq also became [[chef-lieu]] of the canton by royal decree.
