[[File:Zwerggans (Anser erythropus) - Weltvogelpark Walsrode 2011.jpg|thumb|A Lesser White-fronted Goose at [[Weltvogelpark Walsrode]]]]

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lesser White-fronted Goose&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anser erythropus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[goose]] closely related to the larger [[White-fronted Goose]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;A. albifrons&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). It breeds in northernmost [[Asia]], but it is a scarce breeder in [[Europe]]. There is a re-introduction scheme in [[Fennoscandia]].

The Lesser White-fronted Goose winters further south in Europe and is a rare winter vagrant to [[Great Britain]]. Individual birds formerly appeared regularly at [[WWT Slimbridge]] in [[Gloucestershire]], England, where they inspired [[Sir Peter Scott]] to set up The [[Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust]] – modern records, however, are far less frequent, a consequence of the species&amp;apos; decline on its [[Europe]]an breeding grounds. An attractive species, it is also widely kept in wildfowl collections and, as a result, escapes do occur; individuals seen in [[summer]], or in the company of other [[feral]] geese, are likely to be of captive origin.

The two white-fronted goose species differ little other than in size (the Lesser, at 53&amp;amp;ndash;66&amp;amp;nbsp;cm length and with a 120&amp;amp;ndash;135&amp;amp;nbsp;cm wingspan, is not much bigger than a [[Mallard]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anas platyrhynchos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) but both may be readily distinguished from the [[Greylag Goose]] by their bright orange legs and their mouse-coloured upper wing-coverts. The Greylag Goose has the bill and legs flesh-coloured, and the upper wing-coverts of a bluish-grey.

Both white-front species have a very conspicuous white face and broad black bars which cross the belly.

Adult Lesser White-fronted Geese, as well as being smaller than White-fronted Geese, have an obvious yellow eye-ring, and the white facial blaze goes up to the crown.

Lesser White-fronted Goose is considered an [[endangered species]], but there are programmes to [[Reintroduction|reintroduce]] animals into the wild to strengthen the population. Additionally it is one of the species to which the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[AEWA]]) applies.

==Fennoscandian population==
This genetically distinct population is now estimated at about 20 breeding pairs or 60–80 total individuals at most. They breed in Northern Norway and overwinter in Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey. There is a major stopover site at [[Hortobágy]], Hungary where the birds spend up to two months during autumn and one month during the spring migration.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|author= Lengyel S, Tar J, Rózsa L | title=Flock size measures of migrating Lesser White-fronted Geese Anser erythropus| format=pdf| journal=Acta Zoologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae| year=2012| volume=58|pages=297–303|url=http://www.zoologia.hu/list/LWfG.pdf}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
