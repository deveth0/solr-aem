&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Le Ventre de Paris&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1873) is the third novel in [[Émile Zola]]&amp;apos;s twenty-volume series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It is set in and around [[Les Halles]], the enormous, busy central market of 19th Century [[Paris]]. Les Halles, rebuilt in cast iron and glass during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] was a landmark of modernity in the city, the wholesale and retail center of a thriving food industry. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Le Ventre de Paris&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (translated into English under many variant titles but literally meaning &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Belly of Paris&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is Zola&amp;apos;s first novel entirely on the [[working class]].

The protagonist is Florent, an escaped [[political prisoner]] mistakenly arrested after the [[French coup of 1851]]. He returns to his step-brother Quenu, a [[Charcuterie|charcutier]] and his wife Lisa Quenu (formerly Macquart), with whom he finds refuge. They get him a job in the market as a fish inspector. After getting mixed up in an ineffectual [[Socialism|socialist]] plot against the Empire, Florent is arrested and deported again.

Although Zola had yet to hone his mastery of working-class speech and idioms displayed to such good effect in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[L&amp;apos;Assommoir]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the novel conveys a powerful atmosphere of life in the great market halls and of working class suffering. There are a number of vivid descriptive passages, the most famous of which, his description of the olfactory sensations experienced upon entering a [[cheese]] [[Retailing|shop]], has become known as the &amp;quot;Cheese Symphony&amp;quot; due to its ingenious orchestral metaphors. Throughout the book, the painter Claude Lantier, a relative of the Macquarts and later the protagonist of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[L&amp;apos;Œuvre]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1886) - shows up to provide a semi-authorial commentary, playing the role of [[choir|chorus]]. It is an interesting and often powerful work, though not usually considered as being on a par with the novelist&amp;apos;s greater achievements later in the Rougon-Macquart cycle.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Le ventre de Paris&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was originally translated into English by [[Henry Vizetelly]] and published in 1888 under the title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fat and Thin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. After Vizetelly&amp;apos;s imprisonment for [[obscene libel]] the novel was one of those revised and expurgated by his son, Ernest Alfred Vizetelly; this mutilated version entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Fat and the Thin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; appeared in 1896 and has been reprinted many times. Until 2007 this remained the only English version widely available. Henry&amp;apos;s original full edition was afterward reprinted in Paris for adventurous English readers. The novel was newly translated in 1955 by [[David Hughes (novelist)|David Hughes]] and [[Marie-Jacqueline Mason]] for [[Elek Books]] under the title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Savage Paris&amp;apos;&amp;apos; but this has long been out of print. [[Oxford World&amp;apos;s Classics]] published a new translation by [[Brian Nelson (critic)|Brian Nelson]] entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Belly of Paris&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 2007 and [[Modern Library]] published a new translation by [[Mark Kurlansky]] in 2009.
