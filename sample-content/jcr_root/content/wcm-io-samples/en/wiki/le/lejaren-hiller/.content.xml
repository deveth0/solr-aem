        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lejaren Arthur Hiller&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 23, 1924, [[New York City]] – January 26, 1994, [[Buffalo, New York]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[composer]]. In 1957 he collaborated on the first significant computer music composition, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Illiac Suite]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, with [[Leonard Issacson]]. It was his fourth string quartet. In 1958 he founded the Experimental Music Studio at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. His notable pupils included composers [[James Fulkerson]], [[Larry Lake (musician)|Larry Lake]], [[Ilza Nogueira]], [[David Rosenboom]], [[Bernadette Speach]] and [[James Tenney]].

He was originally trained as a chemist,  and worked as a research chemist for [[DuPont]] in Waynesboro, Virginia from 1947 to 1952. He developed the first reliable process for dyeing [[Orlon]] and coauthored a popular textbook. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;James Bohn. &amp;quot;[http://ems.music.uiuc.edu/history/hiller.html Lejaren Hiller]&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ems.music.uiuc.edu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He played [[piano]], [[oboe]], [[clarinet]], and [[saxophone]] as a child. He also studied composition with [[Roger Sessions]] and [[Milton Babbitt]] while earning his chemistry degree at [[Princeton University]]. His father, [[Lejaren Hiller, Sr.]], was a well-known art photographer who specialized in historical tableaux.

He wrote an article on the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Illiac Suite&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Scientific American]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which garnered a lot of attention from the press, generating a storm of controversy. The musical establishment was so hostile to this interloper scientist that both &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Baker&amp;apos;s Biographical Dictionary of Musicians]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refused to include him until shortly before his death.

A majority of Hiller&amp;apos;s works after 1957 do not involve computers at all, but might include [[stochastic music]], [[indeterminacy in music|indeterminacy]], [[serialism]], Brahmsian traditionalism, [[jazz]], [[performance art]], [[folksong]] and [[counterpoint]] mixed together. He also collaborated with [[John Cage]] for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[HPSCHD]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 1968, he joined the faculty at [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] as Slee Professor of Composition, where he established the school&amp;apos;s first computer music facility and codirected with Lukas Foss the celebrated Center for the Creative and Performing Arts. His illness forced him to retire in 1989. He died from [[Alzheimer&amp;apos;s disease]] in 1994.
