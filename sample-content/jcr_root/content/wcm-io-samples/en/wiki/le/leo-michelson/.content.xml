&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Leo Michelson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-lv|Leo Mihelsons}}; 12 May 1887–1978) was a [[Latvia]]n-[[United States|American]] artist considered part of the [[School of Paris|École de Paris]], although his works span many periods and styles.

==Biography==
Michelson was born in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]]. He attended the Imperial Academy in [[St. Petersburg, Russia|St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]], and then the [[University of Tartu]] in [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]].

The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] forced Michelson to leave Russia for [[Munich, Germany|Munich]], [[Germany]], where he participated in the beginnings of [[German Expressionism]].

By 1920 Michelson was living in [[Paris, France|Paris]] and had established an international reputation for his [[painting]]s, [[printing|prints]], and [[sculpture]]s. As a prominent member of the Paris School his works were shown in major exhibits throughout [[Western Europe]], the [[Soviet Union]], and the [[United States]]. After the fall of Paris to [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939, Michelson fled to [[New York City]], where he spent the rest of his life.

Michelson is described as an &amp;quot;eternal emigrant, eternal student&amp;quot; because he was always studying and experimenting with new styles. Michelson actually carried [[crayon]]s with him so he could sketch where ever he was. Art historians have compared Michelson to both Chagall and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} but it was [[Titian]] who Michelson said was his inspiration.

Michelson painted over 1,000 paintings. His widow, Janine, selected [[Marshall, Texas]], as the permanent home for her late husband&amp;apos;s works ([http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/4aa/4aa568.htm]) in what is known as the [[Michelson Museum of Art]].
