        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Legio quinta decima &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Primigenia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fifteenth &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Firstborn&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Legion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) - a name of the goddess [[Fortuna]]) was a legion of the Roman army.

It was originally levied by the emperor [[Caligula]] in 39, to aid in the Germanic campaigns and was stationed in the [[Rhine]] frontier until 70, when it was destroyed during the [[Batavian rebellion]] with the [[Legio V Alaudae|V &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alaude&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]]. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;cognomen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Primigenia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is derived from the goddess [[Fortuna (luck)|Fortuna]].

== Deployment ==

After the first campaigns, XV &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Primigenia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was stationed in Moguntiacum ([[Mainz]]). In 43, the redeployment of units following the [[Roman invasion of Britain]] leads the XV &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Primigenia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to Xanten, in a camp shared with the V &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alaudae&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 47 both legions were involved in the war against the [[Frisia]]ns and in the construction of Corbuloâ€™s canal in the Rhine.

During the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] (68-69) XV &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Primigenia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the other German border legions supported the claim of [[Vitellius]] to the throne, first against [[Galba]] and afterwards against [[Otho]]. When [[Vespasian]] was finally acclaimed undisputed emperor, the legions XV &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Primigenia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and V &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alaudae&amp;apos;&amp;apos; returned to Castra Vetera ([[Xanten]] camp), where the [[Batavian rebellion]] was already in progress.

== Defeat ==

Both legions were besieged in their winter camp in 69 by a rebel army commanded by [[Gaius Julius Civilis|Civilis]]. They finally surrendered in 70 due to hunger and left the camp in orderly fashion under promises of safe conduct. However, the rebels chased the legions and killed the surviving [[legionary|legionaries]].
