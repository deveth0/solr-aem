&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Leirvik&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[List of cities in Norway|town]] and the [[administrative centre]] of [[Stord]] municipality in the county of [[Hordaland]], [[Norway]]. Leirvik is the regional centre of [[Sunnhordland]], and has many public services and offices such as the regional court and [[Sunnhordland Museum]],&amp;lt;!-- the museum&amp;apos;s website refers to the it as &amp;quot;Sunnhordland Museum&amp;quot; on its english web pages --&amp;gt; as well as shops and restaurants. In 2009, Leirvik had a population of 11,424, and covers an area of 8.46 square kilometres with a population density of 1,350 per square kilometre.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ssb1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/beftett_en/tab-2009-06-16-01-en.html|title=Urban settlements. Population and area, by municipality. 1 January 2009|accessdate=2009-07-28|publisher=Statistics Norway|year=2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Leirvik has approximately 65% of the total population of Stord. It is the largest urban area that is located in a municipality where [[Nynorsk]] is the preferred language form.

Confusingly, when the municipality of Stord declared township, they decided to name the town &amp;quot;Stord&amp;quot;. This was to ensure that Leirvik and its surrounding areas were large and populous enough to qualify for Norwegian town status{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}. Even though this is the official name, the public acceptance of this is minimal, and the name of the urban community remains &amp;quot;Leirvik&amp;quot;. The name translates into &amp;apos;clay bay&amp;apos;, the word &amp;quot;leire&amp;quot; meaning &amp;quot;[[clay]]&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;vik&amp;quot; meaning &amp;quot;[[bay]]&amp;quot;. The name comes from the high concentration of clay in the ground. The locals often refer to Leirvik by the name &amp;quot;Vikjo&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;Leirvik&amp;quot;.
