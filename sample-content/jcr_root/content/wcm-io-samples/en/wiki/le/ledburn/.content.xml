&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ledburn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in the [[parish]] of [[Mentmore]], in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].  The name Ledburn is [[Old English language|Anglo Saxon]] in origin, and means &amp;quot;stream with a conduit&amp;quot;.  In [[Manorialism|manorial]] records of 1212 it was recorded as &amp;quot;Leteburn&amp;quot;.

The hamlet consists of two roads with a mixture of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] cottages and modern houses, a [[public house]] (The Hare), two 16th century farm houses and a [[manor house]].  Ledburn Manor was built in the 16th century, and in the early 18th century it was given a new front facade in the [[classical style]].

During the 19th and 20th century, the hamlet was owned by [[Mayer Amschel de Rothschild|Baron Mayer de Rothschild]] and, by inheritance, became part of the [[Earl of Rosebery]]&amp;apos;s [[Mentmore]] estate.  The manor house at that time served as the estate office and home of the resident [[Land Agent]].  A tiny [[Methodist]] chapel in the hamlet has recently been converted to a private house.

The agricultural land in the village, having passed out of the Rothschild&amp;apos;s ownership in the 20th century, is now back in the family&amp;apos;s ownership, and is part of Sir Evelyn de Rothschild&amp;apos;s [[Ascott, Buckinghamshire|Ascott]] Estate.

Ledburn was the scene of the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|&amp;quot;Great Train Robbery&amp;quot;]] when a Â£2.6 million train robbery was committed at Bridego Railway Bridge (Bridge Number 127) on 8 August 1963.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news
