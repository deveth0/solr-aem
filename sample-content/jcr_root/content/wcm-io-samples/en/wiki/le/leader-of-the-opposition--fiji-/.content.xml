The post of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Leader of the Opposition&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a political office common in countries that are part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It did not originate in [[Fiji]] but has a long tradition; in [[United Kingdom|British]] constitutional theory, the Leader of the Opposition must pose a formal alternative to the government, ready to form a government himself should the [[List of Prime Ministers of Fiji|Prime Minister]] lose the confidence of the [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]]. In addition, the Leader of the Opposition chooses 8 of the 32 members of the [[Senate (Fiji)|Senate]], Fiji&amp;apos;s upper house of [[Parliament (Fiji)|Parliament]], and has the right to be consulted about the appointment of the [[Chief Justice (Fiji)|Chief Justice]].

In Fiji, the Leader of the Opposition is formally appointed by the [[List of Presidents of Fiji|President]]. The appointment is not at the president&amp;apos;s personal discretion, however, as he is required by the [[Constitution of Fiji|Constitution]] to appoint the person most acceptable to the majority of the Opposition (defined as members of the House of Representatives who belong to political parties not represented in the [[Cabinet (Fiji)|Cabinet]]). In theory, that means the parliamentary leader of the largest Opposition [[List of political parties in Fiji|party]].  In practice, the person most eligible may decline the office, as was the case between 2001 and 2004, when [[Mahendra Chaudhry]], whose [[Fiji Labour Party|Labour Party]] holds 28 of the 30 Opposition seats in the House of Representatives, adamantly refused to accept the position of Leader of the Opposition, insisting that he and his party wanted representation in the Cabinet instead.  Until he reversed his position late in 2004 (following the collapse of negotiations with Prime Minister [[Laisenia Qarase|Qarase]]), this forced the President to appoint [[Mick Beddoes]], the sole parliamentary representative of the [[United Peoples Party (Fiji)|United General Party]], as Leader of the Opposition.
