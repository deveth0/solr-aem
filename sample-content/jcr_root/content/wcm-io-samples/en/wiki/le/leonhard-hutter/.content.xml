&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Leonhard Hutter&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hütter&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Latinized as Hutterus; January 19, 1563 – October 23, 1616) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Lutheran]] [[theology|theologian]].

==Life==
He was born at [[Nellingen]] near [[Ulm]].  From 1581 he studied at the universities of [[university of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], [[university of Leipzig|Leipzig]], [[university of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] and [[university of Jena|Jena]]. In 1594 he began to give theological lectures at [[Jena]], and in 1596 accepted a call as professor of [[theology]] at [[university of Wittenberg|Wittenberg]], where he died twenty years later.

==Works==
Hutter was a stern champion of [[Lutheran orthodoxy]], as set down in the confessions and embodied in his own &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Compendium locorum theologicorum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1610; reprinted 1863), being so faithful to his master as to win the title of &amp;quot;Luther redonatus.&amp;quot;

In reply to [[Rudolf Hospinian]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Concordia discors&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1607), he wrote a work, rich in historical material but one-sided in its argument, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Concordia concors&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1614), defending the [[formula of Concord]], which he regarded as inspired. His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Irenicum vere christianum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is directed against [[David Pareus]] (1548–1622), professor primarius at Heidelberg, who in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Irenicum sive de unione et synodo Evangelicorum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1614) had pleaded for a reconciliation of [[Lutheranism]] and [[Calvinism]]; his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Calvinista aulico-politicus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1610) was written against the &amp;quot;damnable Calvinism&amp;quot; which was becoming prevalent in [[Holstein]] and [[Brandenburg]]. Another work, based on the [[Formula of Concord]], was entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Loci communes theologici&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
