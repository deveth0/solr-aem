The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lennon Wall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Lennon Wall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,  is a wall in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]. Once a normal wall, since the 1980s it has been filled with [[John Lennon]]-inspired [[graffiti]] and pieces of lyrics from [[The Beatles|Beatles]] songs.

In 1988, the wall was a source of irritation for the communist regime of [[Gustáv Husák]]. Young [[Czech people|Czech]]s would write grievances on the wall and in a report of the time this led to a clash between hundreds of students and security police on the nearby [[Charles Bridge]]. The movement these students followed was described ironically as &amp;quot;Lennonism&amp;quot; and Czech authorities described these people variously as alcoholics, mentally deranged, sociopathic, and agents of Western [[capitalism]].

The wall continuously undergoes change and the original portrait of Lennon is long lost under layers of new paint. Even when the wall was repainted by some authorities, on the second day it was again full of poems and flowers. Today, the wall represents a symbol of youth ideals such as [[love]] and [[peace]].

The wall is owned by the [[Knights of Malta]], who allowed the graffiti to continue on the wall, and is located at &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Velkopřevorské náměstí&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Grand [[Priory]] Square), [[Malá Strana]].
