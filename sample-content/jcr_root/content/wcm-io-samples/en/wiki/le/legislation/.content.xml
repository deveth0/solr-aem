&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Legislation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;quot;[[statutory law]]&amp;quot;) is law which has been [[promulgation|promulgated]] (or &amp;quot;[[enact]]ed&amp;quot;) by a [[legislature]] or other [[Government|governing body]], or the process of making it. (Another source of law is judge-made law or [[case law]].) Before an item of legislation becomes law it may be known as a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]], and may be broadly referred to as &amp;quot;legislation&amp;quot; while it remains under consideration to distinguish it from other business. Legislation can have many purposes: to regulate, to authorize, to proscribe, to provide (funds), to sanction, to grant, to declare or to restrict.

Under the [[Westminster system]], an item of primary legislation is known as an [[Act of Parliament]] after enactment.

Legislation is usually proposed by a member of the legislature (e.g. a member of Congress or Parliament), or by the executive, whereupon it is debated by members of the legislature and is often amended before [[passage (legislature)|passage]]. Most large legislatures enact only a small fraction of the bills proposed in a given [[Session (parliamentary procedure)|session]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/two_column_table/Resumes.htm Senate.gov]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Whether a given bill will be proposed and [[enter into force]] is generally a matter of the legislative priorities of government.

Legislation is regarded as one of the three main functions of government, which are often distinguished under the doctrine of the [[separation of powers]]. Those who have the formal power to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;create&amp;apos;&amp;apos; legislation are known as [[legislator]]s; a [[judiciary|judicial branch]] of government will have the formal power to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;interpret&amp;apos;&amp;apos; legislation (see [[statutory interpretation]]); the [[executive branch]] of government can act only within the powers and limits set by the law.

== Latest Revision ==
The function and procedures are primarily the responsibility of the legislature. However, there are situations where legislation is made by other bodies or means, such as when [[constitutional law]] or [[secondary legislation]] is enacted. Such other forms of law-making include [[referendum]]s, constitutional conventions, [[Order in Council|orders in council]] or [[regulations]]. The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;legislation&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is sometimes used to include these situations, or the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[primary legislation]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; may be used to exclude these other forms.

==Dead letter==
The phrase &amp;quot;dead letter&amp;quot; refers to legislation that has not been revoked, but that has become inapplicable or obsolete or is no longer enforced.
