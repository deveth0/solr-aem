&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lyudmila Andreyevna Kondratyeva&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Людмила Андреевна Кондратьева}}) (born April 11, 1958) is a [[Russians|Russian]] [[Athletics (sport)|athlete]], who competed for the [[Soviet Union]] and is the 1980 [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] 100 m champion.

Kondratyeva began athletics at age 11 at the [[Children and Youth Sport School]] in Shakhty, her first trainer being Lyudmila Mikhailovna Pavlenko.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Book&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=Lyudmila Kondratyeva|author=R. V. Orlov|publisher=[[Fizkultura i sport (publisher)|Fizkultura i sport]]|series=Heroes of the Olympic Games|year=1983|location=Moscow|language=Russian|url=http://www.sportlib.ru/books/la/kondratieva/}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Two years later she passed exams into [[Rostov on Don]] Children and Youth Sport School, created in 1971, where she was coached by Nina Vasilyevna Lazarchenko.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Book&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; In 1973 she became a member of the Soviet Union National Youth Team, and in 1974 - of the Soviet Union National Team.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Book&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; At the 1975 European Youth Championships Kondratyeva finished 4th in the 200m and in the 4 x 100 m relay.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Book&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Four years later she became the winner of the 200 m at the [[1978 European Championships in Athletics#Track 2|1978 European Championships]], where she also won a gold in the 4 x 100 m [[relay race|relay]] event.

Now one of the medal favourites for the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], which were held in [[Moscow]], she also ran a non-recognised [[World Record]] just before the Olympics.  The final was a close race, with the first 5 finishing within 1 tenth of a second. A photo finish showed that Kondratyeva had beaten [[Marlies Göhr]] of [[East Germany]] by just 0.01 seconds. Unfortunately, Kondratyeva pulled her [[hamstring]] at the finish, thereby not allowing her to run the 200 m or the 4 x 100 m relay.

Unable to compete at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] due to the boycott led by the [[Soviet Union]], Kondratyeva could not defend her Olympic title. She retired after that season and married [[Yuriy Sedykh]], two time Olympic champion in the [[hammer throw]], although they would later divorce. She came out of retirement to compete at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. She made the semi-finals of the 100m and won a bronze medal as part of the Soviet women&amp;apos;s 4x100m relay.
