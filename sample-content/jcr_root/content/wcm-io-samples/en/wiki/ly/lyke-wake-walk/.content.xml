The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lyke Wake Walk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was started by a local farmer, Bill Cowley, in the North Riding of [[Yorkshire]], England, in 1955. He claimed that one could walk {{convert|40|mi|km}} over the [[North York Moors National Park|North York Moors]] from east to west (or vice-versa) on [[Calluna|heather]] all the way except for crossing one or two roads and he issued a challenge that walkers took up with great enthusiasm.  He challenged them to walk it in less than 24 hours from Scarth Wood Moor, near [[Osmotherley, North Yorkshire|Osmotherley]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{coord|54.389|-1.273|region:GB_scale:50000}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; to [[Ravenscar, North Yorkshire|Ravenscar]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{coord|54.397|-0.492|region:GB_scale:50000}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He concentrated on the west to east route because the [[prevailing wind]] came from the west, in principle making it easier to walk with the wind on one&amp;apos;s back and with the heather lying away from the walker.

The walk took its name from the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Lyke Wake Dirge]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, probably Yorkshire&amp;apos;s oldest [[dialect]] verse, which takes its name from the watching &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wake (ceremony)|wake]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; over the corpse &amp;apos;&amp;apos;(lyke)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; The song tells of the soul&amp;apos;s passage through the afterlife. The walk was not meant to be taken as the route of a [[corpse road]] but the possibility of bad weather and difficult conditions make it an appropriate club song.

The end result of completing the walk was a terrific sense of achievement and a black-edged card from the Chief Dirger (Bill Cowley).

The first years of the walk were difficult as there was no worn track but eventually the walk had to be re-thought because the numbers of people attempting it played havoc on the ground surface. Now various alternative routes are offered and the Walk club works with the [[National parks of England and Wales|National Park]] Authority to try to limit the environmental damage.

Bill Cowley died on 14 August 1994. The &amp;apos;old&amp;apos; Lyke Wake Club, which he founded, closed down in October 2005, the Walk&amp;apos;s fiftieth anniversary. However, a &amp;apos;new&amp;apos; club has been established - not without controversy &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://archive.thenorthernecho.co.uk/2005/4/22/15665.html {{dead link|date=May 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; - to preserve the traditions established by Cowley and to take over the old club&amp;apos;s functions of recording crossings, holding wakes and liaising with public authorities.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Note:&amp;apos;&amp;apos; The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lyke Wake Dirge&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has been set to music with various tunes. One notable setting is part of the [[Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings]] by [[Benjamin Britten]].
