An avid gamer, he wrote a popular online [[FAQ]] for the Atari coin-op game &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Klax (computer game)|KLAX]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

* &amp;quot;I guess the way I describe it is that I&amp;apos;m the father of Asteroids. Ed Logg is the mother of Asteroids, because he had to live with it for nine months and deliver a finished product. All I had to do was to provide a seed.&amp;quot;{{Cite quote|date=April 2009}}
