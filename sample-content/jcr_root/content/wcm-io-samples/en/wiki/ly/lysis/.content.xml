&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lysis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Greek language|Greek]] λύσις, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;lýsis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;lýein&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;to separate&amp;quot;) refers to the breaking down of a [[Cell (biology)|cell]],  often by [[virus|viral]], [[enzyme|enzymic]], or [[osmosis|osmotic]] mechanisms that compromise its integrity. A fluid containing the contents of lysed cells is called a &amp;quot;lysate&amp;quot;.

Many species of [[bacteria]] are  subject to lysis by the enzyme [[lysozyme]], found in animal [[saliva]], [[egg white]], and other [[secretion]]s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |editor=P.

==Cytolysis==
{{main|Cytolysis}}

Cytolysis can be prevented by several different mechanisms, including the [[contractile vacuole]] that exists in some [[paramecium|paramecia]], which rapidly pump water out of the cell.

Cytolysis does not occur under normal conditions in plant cells because plant cells have a strong cell wall that contains the osmotic pressure, or [[turgor pressure]], that would otherwise cause cytolysis to occur.

==Oncolysis==
Oncolysis refers to the destruction of [[neoplastic]] cells or of a [[tumour]].

It is also used to refer to the reduction of any [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Oncolysis|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/oncolysis|work=Medical Dictionary|publisher=Farlex|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Plasmolysis==
[[Image:Rhoeo Discolor - Plasmolysis.jpg|thumbnail|right|Plasmolysis]]
{{main|Plasmolysis}}
Plasmolysis is the contraction of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s within plants due to the loss of water through [[osmosis]].  In a [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]] environment, the cell membrane peels off of the [[cell wall]] and the [[vacuole]] collapses. These cells will eventually wilt and die unless the flow of water caused by osmosis can stop the contraction of the [[cell membrane]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

==Applications==
Cell lysis (splitting of cells) is used to break open cells when it is desirable to avoid shear forces that would denature or degrade sensitive macromolecules, such as proteins and DNA. For example, lysis is used in [[Western blotting|western]] and [[Southern blotting]] to analyze the composition of specific [[proteins]], [[lipids]], and [[nucleic acids]] individually or as [[Protein complex|complexes]]. Depending upon the [[detergent]] used, either all or some membranes are lysed. For example, if only the [[cell membrane]] is lysed then [[gradient centrifugation]] can be used to collect certain [[organelle]]s.
