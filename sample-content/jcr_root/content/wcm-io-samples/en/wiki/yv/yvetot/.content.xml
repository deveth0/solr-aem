&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yvetot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Seine-Maritime]] [[Departments of France|department]] in the [[Haute-Normandie]] region in northern [[France]].

==History==
The town’s prosperity was linked to strong commerce, developed as early as the 17th century, thanks to its fiscal statutes and to [[cotton]] spinning, which saw massive expansion after 1794.  In the 19th century, the town developed fabric production.
Until 1926, Yvetot had been [[chef-lieu]] of the old [[arrondissement]] of Yvetot, and a sub_prefecture. During this period of reorganisation, it lost its status of sub-prefecture.
In [[World War II]], Yvetot was practically razed in 1940 by the Germans. Later, the 75th Division of the U.S. Army, [[575th Signal Company (United States)|575th Signal Co.]], maintained its command post in the town from December 14&amp;amp;ndash;20, 1944, as it counterattacked against the German army.
After the war, Yvetot was rebuilt in a classical style and regained its importance in the middle of the 20th century.

==The Round Church and its stained-glass window==
The stained-glass window, considered the largest in Europe with an area of 1046 m², was constructed in the 1950s by [[Max Ingrand]]. The window&amp;apos;s main colors are in shades of crimson, gold and blue.  Meticulous assembly from a thousand pieces of glass, the stained-glass window portrays saints, with a wide section consecrated to the [[Normans]] of the diocese of [[Rouen]]. Either side of [[Christ]] are St. Peter (patron saint of Yvetot for a thousand years) and the apostles, including St. Valery (apostle of Calluses and Vimeux in the 7th century), St. Saëns (an Irish monk and founder of an abbey in the valley of the Varenne), St. Ouen (who introduced monasteries to Rouen) and St. Wandrille. The bishops of Rouen are also depicted.  Among the bishops are St. Roman (in the process of strangling the gargoyle that devastated Rouen), St Rémy, and St Hugues.  Others represented in the stained-glass include the Virgin Mary and [[Joan of Arc]] shining in her armour.

==Anecdotes==
Yvetot’s entry in the  [[Dictionnaire des idées reçues]] by [[Gustave Flaubert]], reads: &amp;quot;YVETOT: Voir Yvetot et mourir ! (See Yvetot and die) (cf. [[Naples]] and [[Seville]])&amp;quot;.
It is in Yvetot that novelist [[Guy de Maupassant]] received his primary education; the town itself and its surrounding area, le [[Pays de Caux]] feature extensively in his oeuvre.
