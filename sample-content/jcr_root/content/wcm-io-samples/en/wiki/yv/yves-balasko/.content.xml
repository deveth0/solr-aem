While at Électricité de France, he proved his first results on the structure of the equilibrium manifold in the theory of general equilibrium. After completing his dissertation on the &amp;quot;Economic equilibrium from the differential point of view,&amp;quot; he had positions at the Universities of Paris XII, Paris I, Geneva and York. He currently holds a position at [[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro]], in [[Brazil]].
