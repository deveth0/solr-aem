&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yvon Jules Labre&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born November 29, 1949 in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]]) is a former Canadian professional [[ice hockey]] player.

Labre was originally drafted by the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], for whom he played 21 games before being selected by the [[Washington Capitals]] in the [[1974 NHL Expansion Draft]]. Labre scored the first-ever home goal for Washington, beating the [[Los Angeles Kings]]&amp;apos; [[goaltender]] [[Rogie Vachon]]. Although he was never one to put up big offensive numbers, Labre&amp;apos;s value was noted in being a hard-nosed defensive defenceman on the ice and an active member of community programs and youth hockey programs off it. Such dedication to a team in a location not known for rich hockey history made him one of the Capitals&amp;apos; most popular players during his time there.

Labre served as team captain from 1976 to 1978. He remained in the Capitals organization after his playing career ended. At various times since his retirement, he has served as an assistant coach, colour commentator, scout and the director of community relations for the Capitals. Labre&amp;apos;s jersey number (#7) was retired by the Capitals on November 22, 1981.
