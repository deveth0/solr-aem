&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mboubène&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a town in the lower delta of the [[Senegal River]], near the mouth of the [[Marigot de Djeuss]]. The town is located on the main highway to the [[Maka-Diama dam]] at a distance of {{convert|10|km|mi|spell=us}} from the coastal city of [[Saint-Louis, Senegal]]. On French and Dutch maps, the name of the town has been spelled variously, including &amp;quot;MBoulene&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Emboulan.&amp;quot; It was called &amp;quot;Biffeche-Ville&amp;quot; during the period of the 1960s through the 1980s when it was inhabited by resettled members of the [[Sereer|Sèrèer]] ethnic group.  (The Sèrèers moved away to the nearby town of [[Savoigne]].)

Today, Mboubène consists of two parts: Al Madinatoul Islamiah Mboubène Peulh inhabited by [[Fula people]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;An ethnicity known in [[French language|French]] as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peulh&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peul&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and in [[Fula language|Fula]] as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fulɓe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and Mboubène Naar primarily inhabited by [[Moors]].  There is a Koranic school and general store at the former, and a royal residence at the latter.

The chief economic activities are animal husbandry and gardening.  Nearby agricultural fields suffer from yearly flooding and salinity.

Mboubène-Peulh is governed by an appointed Chef de Village.
