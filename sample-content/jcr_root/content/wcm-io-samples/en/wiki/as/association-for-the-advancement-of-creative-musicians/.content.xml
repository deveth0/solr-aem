        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AACM&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[non-profit organization]], founded in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States, by pianist/composer [[Muhal Richard Abrams]], pianist [[Jodie Christian]], drummer [[Steve McCall (drummer)|Steve McCall]], and composer [[Phil Cohran]]. Early members included [[Henry Threadgill]], [[Anthony Braxton]], [[Jack DeJohnette]], [[Chico Freeman]], [[Wadada Leo Smith]], [[Leroy Jenkins (jazz musician)|Leroy Jenkins]], and the [[Art Ensemble of Chicago]]: [[Lester Bowie]], [[Roscoe Mitchell]], [[Joseph Jarman]], [[Famoudou Don Moye]], and [[Malachi Favors]].  The AACM is devoted &amp;quot;to nurturing, performing, and recording serious, original music,&amp;quot; according to its charter. It supports and encourages [[jazz]] performers, [[composers]] and [[education|educators]].

The AACM was formed in May 1965 by a group of musicians centered around [[pianist]] [[Muhal Richard Abrams]] who had organized an Experimental Band since 1962. The musicians were generally steadfast in their commitment to their music, despite a lack of performance venues and sometimes indifferent audiences. From 1969 the AACM organised a music education program for inner-city youths.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|author=Litweiler, John | title=The Freedom Principle: Jazz After 1958 | publisher=Da Capo | year=1984|isbn=0-306-80377-1}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In the 1960s and 1970s AACM members were among the most important and innovative in all of jazz, though the AACM&amp;apos;s contemporary influence has waned some in recent years.  Many AACM members have recorded widely: in the early days on the [[Delmark Records]] Avant Garde Jazz series and later on the [[Black Saint/Soul Note]] and [[India Navigation]] labels, and to a lesser extent on the [[Arista Records]] and [[ECM (record label)|ECM]] labels.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.delmark.com/delmark.history.htm Delmark.com]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The musical endeavors of members of the AACM often include an adventurous mixing of avant-garde jazz, classical, and world music. The AACM also ran a school, The AACM School of Music, with classes in all areas taught by members of the AACM. The AACM also had a strong relationship with an influential sister organization, the [[Black Artists&amp;apos; Group]] (BAG) of [[St. Louis, Missouri]].  The AACM has received aid from the [[MacArthur Foundation]] and has a strong relationship with [[Columbia College Chicago|Columbia College]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Power Stronger Than Itself: The Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[George Lewis (trombonist)|George Lewis]], has been published by the University of Chicago Press (May 2008).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nyt_2008&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite news | first = Nate | last=Chinen | title=Four Decades of Music That Redefined Free | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 2, 2008 | accessdate=June 7, 2012 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/02/arts/music/02aacm.html}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
