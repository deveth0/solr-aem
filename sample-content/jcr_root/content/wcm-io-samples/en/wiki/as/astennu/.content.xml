:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This is a page about the mythical creature. For the black metal musician, see [[Astennu (musician)]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

In [[Egyptian mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Astennu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also spelt &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Asten&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Isten&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Astes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Isdes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) refers to a [[baboon]] associated with [[Thoth]]. It was also stated that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Astennu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was merely another aspect of [[Thoth]], as the god could take the form of a [[baboon]]. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;E. A. Wallis Budge, Book of the Dead, Kessinger Publishing, 2003, p 188&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was one of four baboons who stood around the lake of fire at the place of judgement in [[Duat]], and consequently associated with [[Utennu]].

He appears in spell 17 of the Book of the Dead. The name Astennu means the moon.

[[Baboon]] may be an equivalent term for [[dog-headed]] [[ape]]. Among the [[Egyptians]] several kinds of [[apes]] were regarded as [[sacred animals]], but the most revered of all was that which was the companion of [[Thoth]], and which is commonly known as the Dog-headed Ape. This animal seems to have been brought in old, as in modern, times from the country far to the south of [[Nubia]], but whether this be so or not it is certain that the [[Cynocephalus]] ape found its way into [[Egyptian mythology]] at a very early period.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  In the [[Judgment]] Scene he sits upon the standard of the [[Great Scales]], and his duty was to report to his associate [[Thoth]] when the pointer marked the middle of the beam. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Cornelis Petrus Tiele, Comparative history of the Egyptian and Mesopotamian religions, tr. by J. Ballingal [from Vergelijkende geschiedenis der oude godsdiensten, vol.1]. 1882, p 64 [http://books.google.com/books?id=-hQHAAAAQAAJ&amp;amp;dq=asten%20egypt&amp;amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=asten%20egypt&amp;amp;f=false Google Books]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
