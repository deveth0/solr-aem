{{Distinguish|Ascot, Berkshire}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ascott&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] and [[country house]] in the [[parish]] of [[Wing, Buckinghamshire|Wing]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]]. The hamlet lies completely within the boundary of the Ascott Estate; it is home to many of the estate and house staff.

Prior to the [[Norman Conquest]] there was an [[abbey]] at Ascott, that had been given by a royal &amp;lt;!--[[Empress Matilda]]--Not possible, as Matilda was a granddaughter of the Conqueror--&amp;gt;to a [[Benedictine]] [[convent]] in Angiers. In 1415 however, the same year as the [[Battle of Agincourt]], the convent was seized by the English church because it belonged to the [[France|French]] and awarded to the Convent of St Mary du Pre, near [[St Albans]].

In the early 16th century the abbey (along with the [[Manorialism|manor]] of Wing) was seized by [[the Crown]] and given to [[Cardinal Wolsey]], however not long after it was seized once again in the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] and given to [[Baron Dormer|Lord Dormer]]. It was in 1554 that Dormer entertained [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]] at the house, when she was on the road to [[London]] under arrest as a [[Protestant]] because her sister [[Mary of England|Mary]] had just taken the throne.

The former abbey, now a house, itself once featured additions that were attributed to [[Inigo Jones]]. The house fell into decay following the death without heir of its owner the [[Earl of Caernarvon]] in 1709. In 1727 the house and estate were broken up, the deer sold and all the timber cut down and sold off. In the late 19th century members of the [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] banking family began to acquire estates in the area, including Ascott. In 1873 a farm house in the parish known as Ascott Hall was bought by [[Mayer Amschel de Rothschild|Baron Mayer de Rothschild]] he gave it to his nephew [[Leopold de Rothschild]] who employed the architect [[George Devey]] to enlarge the property into a substantial country house. Today this is the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] property known as [[Ascott House]] or sometimes known more simply as just &amp;quot;Ascott&amp;quot;.
