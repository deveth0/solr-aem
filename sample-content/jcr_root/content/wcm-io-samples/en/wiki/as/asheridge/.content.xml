&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Asheridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (recorded &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Esserugge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 13th century) is a small [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in the [[parish]] of [[Chartridge]], in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]]. Prior to 1898 it was part of [[Chesham]] parish. It is situated in the [[Chiltern Hills]], about two and a half miles north west of [[Chesham]], 5 miles from [[Great Missenden]] and 6 miles from [[Wendover]].

The village name is probably of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] origin but its meaning is uncertain. Its may denote, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eastern&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ash tree Ridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, referring to the situation of the village on the ridge of a hill or could derive from previous associations with the manor of nearby [[Aston Clinton]]. Matilda de Esserugge is recorded as having connections with [[Missenden Abbey]] in the mid-13th century.

Asheridge farm house is of 16th century origin. In 1848 Asheridge is recorded as having a population of 129. A school and congregational church were established there during the latter part of the 19th century and records show they were still in existence in 1891. The Blue Ball Public House which was at the centre of the settlement at that time is still in business today.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42547&amp;amp;strquery=chesham  British History Online - Victorian History of Buckinghamshire Volume 3 - Chesham]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On 5 March 1945 a [[Lancaster Bomber]] PB745 crashed in fields near Asheridge. The seven crew of the aircraft were drawn from the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. There was only one survivor, the [[rear gunner]]. A memoral service and dedication of a plaque took place on 13 May 2012.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_yEUszkei0 Memoral serviceand dedication of plaque], Accessed 3 October 2012&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[Aneurin Bevan|Aneurin (Nye) Bevan]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Minister]] responsible for the establishment of the [[National Health Service]] and his wife [[Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge|Jennie Lee]] also a Minister in the same Labour Government and a prime mover in the creation of the [[Open University]], came to live at Wood Farm, Asheridge during the 1950s. After the death of her husband, Nye in 1960 Jennie Lee continued to live there until moving to London in 1969. She became Baroness Lee of Asheridge in 1970.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/0609jlee.html Papers of Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
