&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;As the crow flies&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;in a beeline&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; is an [[idiom]] for the shortest route between two points; the [[geodesic]] distance.

An example is the [[great-circle distance]] between [[Key West, Florida|Key West]] and [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], at either end of the U.S. state of [[Florida]] where the direct route by road is about {{convert|792|mi|abbr=on}} and the direct [[point-to-point transit|point-to-point]] aerial transit path that might be taken by a crow is {{convert|524|mi|abbr=on}}. This also has to be at a [[straight line distance]].

The phrases are attested in print as early as 1758.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

In our extracts from it we shall take the same liberty as in the preceding, of travelling with him &amp;apos;&amp;apos;as the crow flies&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, passing over many places, and only stopping at those which seem best to deserve our reader&amp;apos;s attention.

|quote = They were traveling across-country &amp;apos;&amp;apos;in a beeline&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, thousands of them together, not at all like the helpless fish out of water of popular imagination, but as unconcernedly and naturally as if they had been accustomed to the overland route for their whole lifetimes, and were walking now on the king&amp;apos;s highway without let or hindrance.
