&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ashendon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a village and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], England.  It is about nine miles west of [[Aylesbury]] and seven miles north of [[Thame]].

The [[Toponymy|toponym]] is derived from the  [[Old English]] for &amp;quot;Hill overgrown with ash trees&amp;quot;.  The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 records the village as the property of the Grenville family; it was called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Assedune&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The original name refers to the fact that in Saxon times this area was completely forested, and served as hunting land for the king.

In recent times the [[Manorialism|manor]] of Ashendon passed into the hands of the [[Marquis of Buckingham]].

Included in with the parish of Ashendon are the [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Upper Pollicott&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lower Pollicott&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The names of these hamlets derive from the Anglo Saxon &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pol&amp;apos;s Cottage&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In the less distant past, Ashendon was an entirely farming village and, at present, there is still much agricultural activity within the village.  However, some of the farmhouses have been converted into private residences, the best example of this being Ashendon Farm and its barns.  Although Ashendon is a small village, in comparison with many nearby [[Buckinghamshire]] villages, it has a pub, a recreational playing field, a church and a thriving social club.

One mile south-west of the village, near Lower Pollicott, on the [[Chiltern Main Line]] between {{stnlink|Princes Risborough}} and {{stnlink|Bicester North}}, is the site of the former [[Ashendon Junction]], which was an elaborate [[flying junction]] engineered for a high-speed turnout on to the now-dismantled link to the now disused [[Great Central Main Line]] at [[Grendon Underwood Junction]]. In former times this route was used by express trains between [[London Marylebone]], [[Leicester]] and [[Sheffield]].
