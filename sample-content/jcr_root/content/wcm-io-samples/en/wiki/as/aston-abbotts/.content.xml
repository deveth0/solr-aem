&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aston Abbotts&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aston Abbots&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[village]] and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] within [[Aylesbury Vale]] district in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]].  It is situated about four miles north of [[Aylesbury]] and three miles south west of [[Wing, Buckinghamshire|Wing]].  The parish had a population of 404 according to the 2001 census.

The village name &amp;apos;Aston&amp;apos; is a common one in England, and is [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eastern Estate&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The suffix &amp;apos;Abbotts&amp;apos; refers to the ancient [[abbey]] in the village, which until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] was the country home of the abbots of [[St Albans]] in [[Hertfordshire]].  The present house known as [[The Abbey, Aston Abbotts]] was largely rebuilt in the early 19th century.

The [[hamlet (UK place)|hamlet]] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Burston&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sits within this parish.

During the [[Second World War]] from 1940 to 1945 Dr [[Edvard Beneš]], the exiled President of [[Czechoslovakia]], stayed at The Abbey in Aston Abbotts.  His advisers and secretaries (called his Chancellery) stayed in nearby [[Wingrave]], and his military intelligence staff stayed at nearby [[Addington, Buckinghamshire|Addington]].  President Beneš donated a bus shelter to the villages of Aston Abbotts and Wingrave in 1944.  This is on the A418 between the two villages.
