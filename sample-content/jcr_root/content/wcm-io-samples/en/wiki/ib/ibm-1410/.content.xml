The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;IBM 1410&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a member of the [[IBM 1400 series]], was a variable [[wordlength]] [[decimal computer]] that was announced by IBM on September 12, 1960 and marketed as a midrange &amp;quot;Business Computer&amp;quot;. It was withdrawn on March 30, 1970. The 1410 was similar in design to the very popular [[IBM 1401]], but it had one major difference. Addresses were five characters long and allowed a maximum memory of 80,000 characters, much larger than the 16,000 characters permitted by the 1401&amp;apos;s three character addresses.  However, the 1410 could also be run in what was termed 1401 compatibility mode.  On the 1410, this was accomplished in wired hardware - the machine literally turned into a 1401 with the flip of a switch.  Later IBM used programs with microcode assist to emulate the 1401, a very early example of [[Virtual machine|virtualization]].

IBM also created the IBM 7010.  The 7010 used the same architecture and the 1410, but was implemented in 7000 series technology (see [[IBM 700/7000 series]]), and supported up to 100,000 characters of storage.
