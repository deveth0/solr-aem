[[File:Ibzan-Abesan.jpg|thumb|200px|Ibzan from &amp;quot;[[Guillaume Rouillé|Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum]] &amp;quot;]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ibzan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-he|אִבְצָן}}; {{lang-la|Abesan}}) appears in the [[Bible]] as one of the Judges of [[Israel]]. Very little is said about him, except the following:

: &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;8&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
: &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;9&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; And he had thirty five sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
: &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;10&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.
from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Judges 12:8-10 ([[King James Version]])&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Many scholars believe that the Bethlehem referred to in the story is the [[Bethlehem of Galilee|Bethlehem]] in the territory of the [[Tribe of Zebulun]], rather than the more famous [[Bethlehem]] in the [[Tribe of Judah]]. However the [[Talmud]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bava Batra]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 91a) asserts that Ibzan is to be identified with [[Boaz]] from the story of [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], who lived in the Bethlehem of Judah, and that he consummated his marriage with Ruth on the last night of his life.
