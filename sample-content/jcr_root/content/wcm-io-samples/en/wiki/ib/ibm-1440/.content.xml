The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;IBM 1440&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a member of the [[IBM 1400 series]], was an [[IBM]] computer designed as a low-cost system for smaller businesses. It was announced on October 11, 1962 and withdrawn on February 8, 1971.

With a variety of models and special features available for the IBM 1440, a system could be tailored to meet immediate [[data processing]] requirements of the business and expanded to absorb increased demands as needed. Programs for the 1440 could be easily adapted to run on the [[IBM 1401]].

The basic system consisted of:
*IBM 1441 Processing Unit contained [[core memory]], [[arithmetic]] and [[logic]] circuits
**Up to 16,000 alphanumeric storage positions were available
*[[IBM 1447]] Operator&amp;apos;s Console
**Model 1 provided basic processing control for the system
**Model 2 added an electric [[typewriter]]

==Peripherals==
The following peripherals were available:
*[[IBM 1442]] Card Reader/Punch
**Model 1 read up to 300 cards a minute and punched up to 80 columns a second
**Model 2 read up to 400 cards a minute and punched up to 160 columns a second
*[[IBM 1443]] Flying Typebar Printer
**Basic rate of 150 lines a minute and up to 430 lines a minute, depending on typebar
**Interchangeable typebars having character sets of 13, 39, 52, and 63 characters
*[[IBM 1311]] [[Disk drive]]
**Capacity for 2 million characters in each removable pack
***With optional &amp;quot;Move Track Record&amp;quot; feature, capacity is increased to 2,980,000 characters in each pack
**Each pack weighed less than 10&amp;amp;nbsp;lb (5&amp;amp;nbsp;kg).
**Up to five 1311 drives

==Pricing==
The cost and rental rate were:
*Purchase price: $90,000 and up, depending on system configuration.
*Rental rate: $1,500 and up, monthly rental, depending on system configuration.

==Installations==
Notable installations included a high end 1440 at the [[Chicago Police Department]] installed by reformist superintendent [[Orlando Winfield Wilson]] in the early 1960s.

In 2012 the TechWorks! Prototype Workshop of the  Center for Technology &amp;amp; Innovation (CT&amp;amp;I) in [[Binghamton, New York]] successfully resurrected a 1440 system including a CPU and console, a 1311 Disk Drive, and a 1442 Card Reader/Punch.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=Ryan|title=A 1440 Data Processing System Finds New Life After 50 Years|journal=IBM Systems Magazine|year=2012|month=Sep/Oct|url=http://www.ibmsystemsmag.com/mainframe/stoprun/Stop-Run/1440/}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
