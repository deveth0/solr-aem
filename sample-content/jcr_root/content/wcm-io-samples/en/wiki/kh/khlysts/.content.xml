&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Khlysts&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Khlysty&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Хлысты in [[Russian language|Russian]]) was an underground sect from late 17th to early 20th century that split off the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and belonged to the [[Spiritual Christians]] (духовные христиане) tendency.
[[File:Ecstatic ritual of Khlysts (radeniye).jpg|thumb|right|350px|&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;Ecstatic ritual of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Khlysts&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;radeniye&amp;quot;)&amp;lt;center/&amp;gt;]]

==Definition==
&amp;apos;Khlyst&amp;apos;, the name commonly applied to them, is a distortion of the name they used; the original name was the invented word Христововеры (Khristovovery, &amp;quot;Christ-believers&amp;quot;) or Христы (Khristy); their critics corrupted the name, mixing it with the word хлыст (khlyst), meaning &amp;quot;a [[whip]]&amp;quot;.
It is also possible that the word &amp;apos;Khlysty&amp;apos; is related to the Greek word &amp;apos;χιλιασταί&amp;apos; (=millennialists), pronounced &amp;apos;khiliasté&amp;apos;, or with &amp;quot;klyster&amp;quot;, meaning &amp;quot;one that purges&amp;quot;. [[Millennialism]] has many different branches and sects and their teachings have common points with those of the Khlysty.

==History==
It is said to have been founded by a [[peasant]], Daniil Filippovich,&amp;lt;ref name=name&amp;gt;Radzinsky, E: The Rasputin File, Anchor, 2000.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; (or Filippov), of [[Kostroma]]. The Khlysty renounced [[priesthood]], holy books and veneration of the [[saint]]s (excluding the [[Theotokos]]). They believed in a possibility of direct communication with the [[Holy Spirit]] and of His embodiment in living people. Curiously enough, they allowed their members to attend [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches. The central idea of Khlystys&amp;apos; [[ideology]] was to practice [[asceticism]]. Khlysty practiced the attainment of divine grace for sin in ecstatic rituals (called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;радéния&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or radeniya) that were rumored to sometimes turn into sexual [[orgy|orgies]].&amp;lt;ref name=name/&amp;gt;
[[Flagellation]] was also rumored, possibly due to the similarity of their name to the word for &amp;quot;whip&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=name/&amp;gt;

Secret Khlysty cells existed throughout pre-revolutionary [[Russia]] (with approximately 40,000 followers in total); they were most common in the factories of the [[Perm]] district. Each cell was normally led by a male and a female leader, who were called the &amp;quot;Christ&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Mother of God&amp;quot; respectively. The cells themselves were referred to as &amp;apos;Arks&amp;apos; among members and messages were carried between them clandestinely in order to facilitate communication. They were often subject to persecution and perceived as a subversive element by the nineteenth century Russian authorities and ecclesiastical bodies.&amp;lt;ref name=name/&amp;gt;

==Rasputin==
In 1910, [[Grigori Rasputin]] was accused of having been a Khlyst by Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva, a governess of the [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchesses of Russia]], after being horrified that Rasputin was allowed access by the Tsar to the nursery of the Grand Duchesses, when the four girls were in their nightgowns. [[Maria Rasputin|Rasputin&amp;apos;s daughter]] later contested this claim, writing that her father investigated but ultimately rejected the sect.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Rasputin, M: &amp;quot;rejected sect&amp;quot;. Rasputin - The Man Behind the Myth, A Personal Memoir, Prentice-Hall, 1977.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Soviet Era==
The number of cells dropped drastically in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times. However, a few secluded Khlysty communities existed in Soviet Russia in [[Tambov]], [[Samara, Russia|Kuibyshev]], [[Orenburg]] and Northern [[Caucasus]] and in Soviet [[Ukraine]].
