In [[cryptography]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;KHAZAD&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-en|x|ɑː|ˈ|z|ɑː|d}} is a [[block cipher]] designed by [[Paulo S. L. M. Barreto]] together with [[Vincent Rijmen]], one of the designers of the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] ([[Rijndael]]). KHAZAD is named after [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Khazad-dûm]], the fictional [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarven]] realm in the writings of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] (see also [[Khazad]]). KHAZAD was presented at the first [[NESSIE]] workshop in 2000, and, after some small changes, was selected as a finalist in the project.

KHAZAD has an eight-round [[substitution-permutation network]] structure similar to that of [[SHARK (cipher)|SHARK]], a forerunner to Rijndael. The design is classed as a &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;legacy-level&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; algorithm, with a 64-bit [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] (in common with older [[cipher]]s such as [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] and [[IDEA (cipher)|IDEA]]) and a 128-bit [[key (cryptography)|key]]. KHAZAD makes heavy use of [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]s as subcomponents; this minimises the difference between the algorithms for [[encryption]] and [[decryption]].

The authors have stated that, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;KHAZAD is not (and will never be) [[patent]]ed. It may be used free of charge for any purpose.&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Frédéric Muller has discovered an attack which can break five of KHAZAD&amp;apos;s eight rounds. No attacks better than this are known as of August 2009.
