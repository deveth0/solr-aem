&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zschornewitz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a village and a former municipality on the southwestern edge of the [[Wittenberg (district)|Wittenberg]] district in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Germany]]. Since 1 January 2011, it is part of the town [[Gräfenhainichen]]. It was part of the [[Amt (subnational entity)|administrative community]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Verwaltungsgemeinschaft&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) of [[Tor zur Dübener Heide]]. It lies about 4&amp;amp;nbsp;km west of the former district seat of [[Gräfenhainichen]], right on the border with [[Saxony]].

== Geography ==
The former municipalities of [[Jüdenberg]], [[Möhlau]], [[Burgkemnitz]] and [[Gröbern]] as well as the town of [[Gräfenhainichen]] border on the community of Zschornewitz.

=== Subdivisions===
The municipality was divided into the historical centre of Kolonie, a neighbourhood to the east built for power station, and Pöplitz, about 2&amp;amp;nbsp;km to the west.

== History ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F088885-0030, Zschornewitz, Straßenansicht.jpg|thumb|A Zschornewitz street in August 1991; one of the power station&amp;apos;s cooling towers can be seen on the right]]
In the 19th century, there were hardly any more than 200 inhabitants in Zschornewitz.

In 1915, work began on the [[power station]] under architect Prof. Klingenberg&amp;apos;s plans. At the same time the garden-city-like workers&amp;apos; community Kolonie was established. In 1916, eight [[turbine]]s capable of 16&amp;amp;nbsp;MW each were generating a total of 128&amp;amp;nbsp;MW, making the Zschornewitz power plant the world&amp;apos;s biggest [[Brown coal|brown-coal]]-fired power station.

In 1920–1921, the school in Kolonie was built.

In 1929, two 85&amp;amp;nbsp;MW turbines were brought into service (at the time, [[Europe]]&amp;apos;s biggest). Thirteen huge chimneys became for decades the community&amp;apos;s backdrop. In 1945, however, the plant was partially dismantled by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] as part of the [[war reparations]] that they exacted from Germany.

On 30 June 1992 came the power plant&amp;apos;s final shutdown. The Kolonie and parts of the plant were granted protection as a memorial. In 1995, the preserved part of the old power plant became an industrial memorial. In 1996, the old workers&amp;apos; community Kolonie was included in the list of [[Expo 2000|EXPO]] projects, undergoing widespread restorations in 1997-99.

On 13 May 2000, Zschornewitz celebrated its 800th anniversary of founding.

== Main sights==

The community&amp;apos;s most prominent building is the former Zschornewitz Power Station. Since 1995 this plant has been open to the public as an energy museum.

== Economy and transportation==
On the old Gröbern [[strip mine]]&amp;apos;s waste dump south of Zschornewitz, a [[wind farm]] was built after the [[brown coal]] pit was shut down. It has eight [[wind turbine]]s. The dump itself rises some 50&amp;amp;nbsp;m above the surrounding area, making it an ideal place to make good use of [[wind energy]].

Zschornewitz lies on state road (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Landesstraße]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) L136 between [[Möhlau]] to [[Gräfenhainichen]] and on district road (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Kreisstraße]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) K&amp;lt;small&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;037 to [[Burgkemnitz]]. Federal highway (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bundesstraße&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) B&amp;amp;nbsp;107 in Gräfenhainichen is only about 2&amp;amp;nbsp;km away.

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dessau-Ost&amp;apos;&amp;apos; interchange on the [[Bundesautobahn 9|A9 autobahn]] between [[Munich]] and [[Berlin]] is about 16&amp;amp;nbsp;km away.

The nearest [[Deutsche Bahn]] [[railway station]]s are to be found in Gräfenhainichen and Burgkemnitz on the [[Wittenberg]] - [[Bitterfeld]] line about 4&amp;amp;nbsp;km away.
