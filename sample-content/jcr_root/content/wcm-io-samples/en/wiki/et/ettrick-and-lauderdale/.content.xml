&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ettrick and Lauderdale&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eadaraig agus Srath Labhdair&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Scottish Gaelic]]) was one of four local government districts in the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]] region of [[Scotland]] from 1975 to 1996.

The district was formed by the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]] from:
*The entire [[counties of Scotland|county]] of [[Selkirkshire]]
*Part of [[Berwickshire]] (the burgh of Lauder and most of the West district of the county)
*Part of [[Midlothian]] (Heriot and Stow)
*Part of [[Roxburghshire]] (the burgh of Melrose and most of Melrose district).

In 1989 the district was enlarged by the addition of the Brothershiels area from the neighbouring district of Midlothian.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The Lothian and Borders Regions and Midlothian and Ettrick and Lauderdale Districts (Brothershiels) Boundaries Amendment Order 1989 (S.I.1989 No. 235 (S.23))[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1989/Uksi_19890235_en_1.htm]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The district council&amp;apos;s headquarters were in [[Galashiels]]. The district had an estimated population of 35,490 in 1994.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 18 Mar 1996 [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960318/text/60318w16.htm]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1996 the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]] replaced the two-tier regions and districts with unitary council areas. The region and four districts were merged to form the present [[Scottish Borders]] area.

*The district&amp;apos;s title still forms part of the name of the [[Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale]] Scottish Parliament constituency.
*Ettrick and Lauderdale Divisional Court, whose area corresponds to the former district, sits at Selkirk.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.district-courts.org/ettrick.htm Scottish Borders - Ettrick and Lauderdale Division (District Courts Association)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
*Ettrick and Lauderdale Sports Council promotes interest and participation in sport in the area covered by the former Ettrick and Lauderdale District Council.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.elsports.org.uk/ Ettrick and Lauderdale Sports Council]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
