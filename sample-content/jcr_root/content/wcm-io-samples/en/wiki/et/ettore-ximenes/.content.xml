&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ettore Ximenes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 11, 1855, [[Palermo]]  &amp;amp;ndash; December 20, 1926, [[Rome]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[sculpture|sculptor]] of mostly [[religion|religious]] and [[mythology|mythological]] subjects.

== Biography==
Ximenes initially embarked on literary studies but then took up sculpture and attended the courses at the [[Palermo]] Academy of Fine Arts. His training was completed in close contact with the Neapolitan school of Verism as a pupil of [[Domenico Morelli]] and [[Stanislao Lista]] at the Naples Academy from 1872 on. He also established a close relationship with [[Vincenzo Gemito]].

He returned to [[Palermo]] in 1874 and won a competition for a four-year grant, which enabled him to study Renaissance sculpture in [[Florence, Italy|Florence]]. He exhibited work in 1878 in [[Paris]], where he came into contact with [[Auguste Rodin]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]]. On returning to Italy, he established his place on the art scene with a broad repertoire of portraits, genre works and funerary statuary, in which his initial realism gave way to Symbolist and Neo-Renaissance elements. In addition to sculpture, he also produced illustrations for the works of [[Edmondo De Amicis]] published by Treves.
Ximenes was involved in all the major official monumental projects in [[Italy]] from the 1880s on and devoted his energies as from 1911 primarily to commissions for important public works in SÃ£o Paulo, Kiev, New York and Buenos Aires.
