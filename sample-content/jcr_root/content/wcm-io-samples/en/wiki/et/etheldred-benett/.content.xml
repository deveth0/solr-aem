Independently well-off, she never married and devoted herself to geology which her relative, the botanist [[Aylmer Bourke Lambert]], encouraged.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

==Biography==
From 1802 she resided at Norton House in [[Norton Bavant]], near [[Warminster]], in Wiltshire, and from at least 1809 until her death devoted herself to collecting and studying the [[fossils]] of her native [[county]]. Her speciality was in the [[Middle Cretaceous]] Upper Greenland in the Vale of [[Wiltshire|Wardour]] and she was well known for her collection. She wrote and privately published a monograph, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Catalogue of the Organic Remains of the County of Wiltshire&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1831) which was widely distributed.  Most of her fossil collection is currently housed at the [[Academy of Natural Sciences]] of Philadelphia after purchase by [[Thomas Bellerby Wilson]] though small parts are in many British museums, in particular [[Leeds City Museum]] and possibly even in [[St. Petersburgh]]; it contains many [[type specimens]] and some of the first fossils found (and recognized though shortly after her death) with the soft tissues preserved.&amp;lt;ref name=phil2000&amp;gt;{{Citation

She corresponded extensively with fellow geologists such as [[George Bellas Greenough]], first president of the Geological Society, [[Gideon Mantell]], [[William Buckland]], and [[Samuel Woodward]].  In addition to her own collection she made many donations to other collections such as the [[British Museum]].  In 1836 she was made a member of the Imperial Natural History Society of Moscow though it is suspected they didn&amp;apos;t realize she was female.
