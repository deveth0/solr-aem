&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ethan Allen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (September 2, 1808–1871) was a major [[United States|American]] arms maker from [[Massachusetts]].  He is believed to be unrelated to the revolutionary [[Ethan Allen]]. His first firearm, the &amp;quot;[[Pocket Rifle]]&amp;quot; was developed in 1836, and his first patent was granted in 1837.

The [[Pepper-box]], known as the &amp;quot;Gun that won the East&amp;quot;, was the most common repeating handgun prior to the invention of the [[revolver|revolving cylinder]].  Its name may have been coined by [[Samuel Clemens]].  It was commonly found during the [[California Gold Rush]].

He was a co-inventor, with [[Thomas P. Wheelock]], of the &amp;quot;Allen and Wheelock&amp;quot; [[single-action revolver]], an inexpensive [[pocket pistol]].

Ethan had daughters but no sons. The &amp;quot;Company&amp;quot; refers to his 2 sons-in-law, Sullivan Forehand and H. C. Wadsworth. On Allen&amp;apos;s death in 1871 they operated the company under their own names: [[Forehand &amp;amp; Wadsworth]], until Forehand reorganized the company in 1890 as the Forehand Arms Company.
