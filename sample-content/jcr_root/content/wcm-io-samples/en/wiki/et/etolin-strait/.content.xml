&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Etolin Strait&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[strait]] in the western region of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]], at about {{Coord|60|20|N|165|25|W|scale:2000000|display=inline,title}}. It is between [[Nunivak Island]] to its west and [[Nelson Island (Alaska)|Nelson Island]] and the Alaska mainland to its east.  It is demarcated by Cape Etolin to the northwest and [[Cape Corwin]] to the southwest (both on Nunivak Island), by Cape Vancouver on Nelson Island to the northeast, and by Cape Avinol on the Alaskan mainland to the southeast.

The strait connects [[Kuskokwim Bay]] and the [[Bering Sea]].  It is {{convert|96|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and 48â€“80&amp;amp;nbsp;km (30-50) miles wide. It is known for strong tidal currents.

Etolin Strait is named after [[Adolf Etolin]], who discovered it and named it Cook Strait. (Etolin was subsequently [[List of Governors of Alaska|governor]] of [[Russian colonization of the Americas|Russian America]] from 1840 to 1845.)
