The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HP-38G&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a programmable [[graphing calculator]] by [[Hewlett Packard]].  It was introduced in 1995 with a [[suggested retail price]] of 79.95 [[US dollar|USD]].  HP credits a committee of eight high school, community college, and university teachers with assisting in the design of the calculator.

The HP-38G, unlike most of HP&amp;apos;s other calculators, uses [[infix notation]] rather than [[Reverse Polish notation]].  Given the calculator&amp;apos;s intended userbase of [[high school]] maths and science teachers and students, this is not surprising.  The calculator is programmable, supporting small, interactive applications called &amp;quot;aplets&amp;quot; [&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[sic]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;].

The production of the hp38g has been discontinued (since approx 2004).

Its replacement was the [[HP-39g series|HP-39G]] (for which a &amp;apos;pirate&amp;apos; [[Computer algebra system|CAS]] aplet came into circulation), hence there is also an [[HP-39g series#HP-39g+|HP-39G+]] which has no known CAS aplet implementable.

Also, for European and some other authorities an [[HP-39g series#HP-40G|HP-40G]] has been available, with an &amp;apos;on-board&amp;apos; CAS facility. Since 2006, the HP-40G is replaced by the [[HP-39g series#HP-40gs|HP-40GS]], built on the [[ARM architecture]], and offering both USB and RS232 connectivity.
