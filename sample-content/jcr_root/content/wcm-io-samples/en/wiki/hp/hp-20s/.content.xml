The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HP-20S&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an algebraic programmable, member of Pioneer series of [[HP calculators]] produced from 1988 to 2003. It is similar to [[HP-21S]]. It has ninety-nine steps of fully merged program and ten memory registers.

==Libraries==

There are six libraries in the ROM, which could be loaded to RAM and used and edited as user programs.

*A- [ROOT] finder, finds a root of f(x)=0
*B- [INT]  integral, calculates definite integral using [[Simpson method]]
*C- [CPL] complex numbers manipulations
*D- [3 by 3] matrix manipulations and line equations solver
*E- [qUAD] quadratic equation solver
*F- [fit] curve fitting, using exponential, logarithmic and power functions

==Design peculiarities==

The HP-20S is not a clean design. It shares the quirks with its close relative, [[HP-21S]]. Some of them are:

*INPUT and SWAP keys, which are awkward and not clear solution to mimic [[Reverse Polish notation|RPN]] functionality.
*Absence of &amp;quot;x&amp;lt;y&amp;quot; test, which enforces using two tests with additional labels and GOTOs in programs which need this functionality.
*A real bug is &amp;quot;x&amp;lt;=y&amp;quot; test. First of all, its name is misleading. Really, it is &amp;quot;x&amp;gt;=y&amp;quot;    test in terms of RPN calculators. The manual says that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;x&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is &amp;apos;hidden&amp;apos; while &amp;apos;&amp;apos;y&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is &amp;apos;visible&amp;apos;. But &amp;apos;&amp;apos;y&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;x&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; power key on the calculator&amp;apos;s keyboards functions in the traditional fashion of other HP RPN calculators. The second problem here is due to algebraic design: in order to separate two arguments of a test should the user divide them either with arithmetic operation or INPUT. If using arithmetic, like:

::RCL 6
::+
::RCL 7
::x&amp;lt;=y?
::GTO A

:the display has &amp;quot;pend&amp;quot; announciator lighted, since calculator sees a pending addition operator. After the program stops, the user can press &amp;quot;=&amp;quot; sign and get the result of pending operation. If the user uses INPUT instead of aritmetic operation, the calculator will display &amp;quot;:&amp;quot; anounciator. In order to hide this effect, the user should place &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; clear command somewhere before program end.

Nevertheless, HP-20S is a functional and fast calculator, with very good LCD, keyboard, look, and feel.  It uses the normal [[infix notation]] rather than RPN, which most HP scientific calculators use.
