[[File:Bernard durer.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Bernhard von Reesen by [[Albrecht Dürer]]. 1521. [[Gemäldegalerie]], [[Dresden]]]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bernhard von Reesen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born ca. 1490) was an [[art collector]] born to a [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] family in [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] (Gdańsk), in [[Poland|Polish]] [[Royal Prussia]].

Reesen received an extensive education as was the custom of that time for men of his background.  As did many other well-off business men and statesmen, at the age of thirty, Reesen commissioned [[Albrecht Dürer]] of [[Nuremberg]] to paint his portrait in 1520/21. The painting can still be seen at the exhibit of Old Masters in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]].

The &amp;apos;von Reesen&amp;apos; name indicates that his family hails from the city of [[Rees, Germany]].
