&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Berton Churchill&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (December 9, 1876 &amp;amp;ndash; October 10, 1940) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] actor.

Born in [[Toronto, Ontario]]. As a young man interested in the theater, he appeared in stock companies as early as 1903 and later headed to [[New York City]] where he began an acting career that soon put him on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage. There, he was one of the earliest members of [[Actors Equity]] and sat on the union&amp;apos;s Council. In 1919 he was in charge of the New York headquarters during the Equity strike in which fellow Canadian and friend, actress [[Marie Dressler]] assumed a major part with him that led to her being blacklisted by the producers.

With the advent of filmmaking in New York Churchill appeared in several motion pictures, and in the 1920s, following the use of sound in film, he moved to [[Hollywood, California]]. There, his powerful stage voice and commanding presence landed him numerous supporting roles, usually as the stern or pompous character with such roles as a banker, a State Governor, or a land baron. Much in demand, in more than 125 films Churchill worked for some of the great directors such as [[Otto Preminger]], [[John Ford]], and [[Frank Capra]]. As well, he performed with many of the most famous stars of the day such as [[Bette Davis]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Cabin in the Cotton]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), [[Jeanette MacDonald]], [[Tyrone Power]], [[Edward G. Robinson]], and  [[Will Rogers]]. Churchill is perhaps best known for his role as Gatewood, the absconding banker in John Ford&amp;apos;s highly acclaimed 1939 film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, starring [[John Wayne]].

In 1925, Churchill helped found the Masquers club that led to him and five other actors creating the [[Screen Actors Guild]] in 1933.

Churchill died in [[New York City]], of uremic poisoning. His body was returned to the west coast to be interred in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]].
