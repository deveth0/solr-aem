The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bell XP-52&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an unusual [[United States]] [[fighter aircraft]] design by the [[Bell Aircraft Corporation]]. It was submitted as part of a [[United States Army Air Corps]] competition held in the winter of 1939.

The [[fuselage]] was round and barrel-shaped, with the pilot in the nose and the [[piston engine]] behind him, driving a pair of contra-rotating [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s at the rear of the fuselage in a [[pusher configuration]]. The wings were mid-fuselage and swept back at an angle of 20 degrees, and the [[Tailplane|horizontal stabilizer]] was connected at each end to [[Twin boom|booms]] from the wings, similar to the [[P-38 Lightning]]&amp;apos;s layout.

The design was one of six chosen for further development, but was then canceled 25 November 1941 in favor of a new design called the XP-59, which was unrelated to the later jet-powered [[Bell P-59 Airacomet]].
