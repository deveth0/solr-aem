&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Benjamin Paul Akers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (July 10, 1825 – May 21, 1861) was an American [[sculpture|sculptor]], from [[Maine]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Saccarappa, Maine]] in 1825, into a large and indigent family of rural Maine.  When his father, Deacon Akers, moved the family from Saccarappa to [[Salmon Falls]]{{dn|date=March 2013}} on the [[Saco River]], he started a wood-turning mill.  For six years as a young man he worked in his father&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;wood turning&amp;quot; mill.  There he invented beautiful patterns and &amp;quot;turned&amp;quot; toys. His brother, Charles &amp;quot;Carl&amp;quot; Akers was also a sculptor and crayon portrait artist. He wrote articles on art for the [[Atlantic Monthly]] and also &amp;quot;The Crayon&amp;quot; a short-lived, New York art magazine in the mid-19th century.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/benjamin-paul-akers-letter-collection-5644 Archives of American Art]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  He spent the winter of 1849 in Boston learning the art of plaster casting with the sculptor, [[Joseph Carew]]. In 1850 he opened a studio in Portland, Maine.  He received a &amp;quot;Commemorative Silver Medal&amp;quot; in the 1854 Exhibition and Fair of the Maine Charitable Mechanic Association.  He moved to [[Boston]] in 1849 where he was an apprentice.  The award was for his bas relief called &amp;quot;Peace&amp;quot;.  &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|last=Usher|first=Leila Woodman|title=Benjamin Paul Akers|journal=New England magazine: an illustrated monthly|year=1895|volume=11|pages=461–468}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  In 1855, at age 30, he went to [[Rome, Italy]] where he worked for several years.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.mainememory.net/artifact/14682 Maine Memory]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Career==
[[File:01-Akers Paul, the Pearl Diver.jpg|thumb|Sculpture called The Pearl Diver]]
Among his works are busts of [[Edward Everett]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], a head of [[John Milton]] and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Pearl Diver]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, on display at the [[Portland Museum of Art]] in [[Portland, Maine]].  [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] described &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dead Pearl Diver&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as an important work of the protagonist, Kenyon, in his novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Marble Faun]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, acknowledging his debt to Akers in the introduction.

==Marriage and children==
In 1858 he met [[Elizabeth Anne Chase Akers Allen]] a young mother, journalist and poet.  They married in August of 1860.  Their only child,  Gertrude Rothermel died in infancy.  He died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 21, 1861 from [[tuberculosis]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://chestofbooks.com/reference/American-Cyclopaedia-V1/Benjamin-Paul-Akers.html Chest of Books]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  He is buried in [[Evergreen Cemetery (Portland, Maine)]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;amp;GSln=Akers&amp;amp;GSiman=1&amp;amp;GSst=23&amp;amp;GRid=63823565&amp;amp; Find-A-Grave]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
