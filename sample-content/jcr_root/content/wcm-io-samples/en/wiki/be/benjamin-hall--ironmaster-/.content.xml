        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Benjamin Hall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (September 29, 1778 &amp;amp;ndash; July 31, 1817) was an industrialist and a prominent figure in [[South Wales]].

== Background, education and connections ==

Hall, who was educated at [[Westminster School]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]] and was admitted to the bar in [[Lincoln&amp;apos;s Inn]] in 1801. In December of that year he married Charlotte the daughter of [[Ironmaster]] [[Richard Crawshay]], becoming a partner in the [[Cyfarthfa Ironworks]] and owner of [[Hensol Castle]] and the [[Abercarn]] estate.

== Member of Parliament ==

He was the first great industrialist to enter [[UK Parliament|Parliament]] serving as [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Totnes (UK Parliament constituency)|Totnes]] from 1806 to 1812, for [[Westbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Westbury]] from 1812 to 1814, and for [[Glamorganshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Glamorganshire]] from then until his death. As soon as he was elected MP for Glamorgan he was admitted a [[Freemason]] and promoted to Provincial Grand Master of [[South Wales]].

== Family &amp;amp; Heir ==

His son was [[Benjamin Hall, 1st Baron Llanover]], a [[civil engineer]] and politician who as Commissioner of Works was notable for the construction of the Clock Tower of the [[Palace of Westminster]].
