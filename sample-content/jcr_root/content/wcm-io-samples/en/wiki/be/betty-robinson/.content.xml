&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elizabeth (&amp;quot;Betty&amp;quot;) Robinson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (August 23, 1911 &amp;amp;ndash; May 18, 1999), later &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elizabeth R. Schwartz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[United States|American]] [[Athletics (sport)|athlete]] and winner of the first [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[100 metres|100 m]] for women.

Born in [[Riverdale, Illinois]], Robinson ran her first 100 meter race on March 30, aged 16. She finished second only to the American record holder. At her next race, she equalled the [[List of world records in athletics|world record]], though her time was not recognized.

At the [[1928 Summer Olympics|Amsterdam Olympics]], her fourth 100 m competition, Robinson reached the final and won, equalling the world record. She was the inaugural Olympic champion in the event, since athletics for women had not been on the program before, and its inclusion was in fact still heavily disputed among officials. With the American [[4 x 100 metres relay|4 x 100 meters relay]] team, Robinson added a [[silver medal]] to her record.

In 1931, Robinson was involved in a plane crash, and was severely injured. A man who discovered her in a coma in the wreckage wrongly thought she was dead, put her in his trunk and drove her to an undertaker, where his mistake was discovered. She awoke from the coma seven months later, although it was another six months before she could get out of a wheelchair, and two years before she could walk normally again.&amp;lt;ref name-&amp;quot;The Guardian&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/jul/31/olympicgames2008.athletics |title=Joy of Six: great Olympic moments &amp;amp;#124; Sport &amp;amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |first= |last=The Guardian |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 January 2013|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=8 January 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Meanwhile, she missed the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Olympics]] in her home country.

Still unable to kneel for a normal 100 m start, Robinson was a part of the US relay team at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]]. The US team was running behind the heavily favored [[Germany|Germans]], but the Germans dropped the baton, allowing Robinson (who handed off the baton to [[Helen Stephens]]) to win her second Olympic title.

Retiring after the Berlin Olympics, Betty Robinson remained involved in athletics as an official. Betty R. Schwartz died aged 87, suffering from [[cancer]] and [[Alzheimer&amp;apos;s disease]] in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].
