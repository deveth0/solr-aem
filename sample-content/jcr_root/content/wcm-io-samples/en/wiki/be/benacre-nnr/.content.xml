&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Benacre NNR&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[National Nature Reserve]] in the [[England|English]] [[county]] of [[Suffolk]]. It is located on the [[North Sea]] coast in the parishs of [[Benacre, Suffolk|Benacre]], [[Covehithe]], [[Reydon]] and [[South Cove, Suffolk|South Cove]]. It lies between the towns of [[Lowestoft]] and [[Southwold]] and is {{convert|393|ha|acre}} in size.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;benacrennr&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designations/nnr/1006015.aspx Benacre NNR], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Natural England&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Retrieved 2012-11-01.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Benacre NNR consists of areas of open water lagoons and reed beds along the Suffolk coast including [[Benacre Broad]], [[Covehithe Broad]] and [[Easton Broad]] and extending as far south as [[Reydon]]. The reserve features extensive [[reedbed]]s, [[woodland]] and [[heathland]], as well as pits created by [[gravel]] extraction. There are over 100 [[species]] of breeding birds, including [[marsh harrier]], [[Bearded Tit|bearded reedling]], [[water rail]], and occasionally [[Great Bittern|bittern]]. The [[flora (plants)|flora]] includes [[seakale]], [[Acanthus ebracteatus|sea holly]], and yellow-horned [[poppy]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;benacrennr&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; Reed is farmed commercially for the [[thatching]] industry, whilst enabling the bearded reedling to find a [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]].

The coastline has eroded rapidly over time and the reserve is threatened by both erosion and sea level rise.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;smp10&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.suffolksmp2.org.uk/publicdocuments/finalsmp/Section%204_Policy%20Development%20Zones/PDZ2v9.pdf Suffolk SMP2 Sub-cell 3c - Policy Development Zone 2 â€“ Benacre Ness to Easton Broad], Shoreline Management Plan, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Royal Haskoning&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, June 2010. Retrieved 2012-11-01.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Some of the ongoing work at the reserve is stopping the encroaching sea by digging new [[lagoon]]s and establishing more sea defences, and replacing the woodland lost to the sea.
