The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bergse Maas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[History of Dutch orthography|pre-1947 spelling]]: Bergsche Maas){{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} is a [[canal]] that was constructed in 1904 to be a branch of the [[Meuse River|Maas River]] (French: Meuse) in the Dutch province of [[North Brabant]]. The Maas  splits near [[Heusden]] into the [[Afgedamde Maas]] and the Bergse Maas. The Afgedamde Maas flows north until its confluence with the river [[Waal (river)|Waal]] (the main distributary of the river [[Rhine]]) to form the [[Merwede]], while the Bergse Maas continues west as the main distributary of the Maas. Part of the Merwede (the [[Nieuwe Merwede]]) rejoins the Bergse Maas to from the [[Hollands Diep]] estuary.

== History ==
Historically, a natural branch of the Maas flowed from Heusden to the [[Amer (river)|Amer]] and [[Hollands Diep]] estuary; this branch silted up and now forms a [[stream]] called [[Oude Maasje]]. The Bergse Maas, which takes its name from the town of [[Geertruidenberg]], was constructed in its [[drainage basin|basin]] to take over its functions, in 1904. The other main distributary of the Maas, was at the same time damned at Heusden, so that the flow of Maas is effectively separated from that of the Rhine distributaries, and has since been known as the &amp;quot;Afgedamde&amp;quot; Maas (literally, &amp;quot;dammed-up&amp;quot;). The resulting separation of the rivers Rhine and Meuse is considered to be the greatest achievement in Dutch hydraulic engineering before the completion of the [[Zuiderzee Works]] and [[Delta Works]].

== Transport ==
There are two road bridges and three car ferries. The latter are free of charge, as promised to the people living in the area when the Bergse Maas was dug, but as of 2004, a fee of €1.00 is charged for cars. For pedestrians, the ferries remain free of charge.
