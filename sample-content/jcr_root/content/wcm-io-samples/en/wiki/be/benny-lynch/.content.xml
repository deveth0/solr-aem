&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Benny Lynch&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2 April 1913 &amp;amp;ndash; 6 August 1946 in [[Gorbals]], [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]) was a [[Scottish People|Scottish]] [[boxing|professional boxer]] who fought in the [[flyweight]] division. He is considered by some to be one of the finest boxers below the [[lightweight]] division in his era and [[Ring Magazine]] has described him as the greatest fighter that [[Scotland]] has ever produced.  He was born in the [[Gorbals]] area of [[Glasgow]] and learned his fighting skills in the [[carnival]] booths that were popular in the West of [[Scotland]] during the [[Great Depression]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Boxrec&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web | author=Boxrec | title=Benny Lynch | work=Boxrec Fighter Page | url=http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=24316&amp;amp;cat=boxer| accessdate=26 June 2008 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Life and career ==

Lynch won the Scottish [[flyweight]] [[boxing]] title on 16 May 1934 with a 15 round decision over Jim Campbell in Glasgow.  He then went on to win the British, European and world flyweight titles from [[Jackie Brown (boxer)|Jackie Brown]] in an historic bout held in [[Manchester]] on 9 September 1935.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;UnterharnscheidtTaylor-Unterharnscheidt2003&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|author1=Friedrich Unterharnscheidt|author2=Julia Taylor-Unterharnscheidt|title=Boxing: medical aspects|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-Vk9C_Cgo20C&amp;amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=22 December 2011|date=14 October 2003|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-709130-3|page=60}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The fight attracted enormous support from Glaswegians who travelled en masse to support &amp;quot;oor Benny&amp;quot;.

There was dispute, on at least on one side of the Atlantic, as to who was the best flyweight boxer in the world. Lynch settled the matter when he out-pointed [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[Small Montana]] in London in 1936 to established himself as the undisputed world flyweight boxing champion.

From 1932-36, he lost just five fights; two of them were points losses to [[Jimmy Warnock]] a &amp;apos;[[Southpaw (boxing)|southpaw]]&amp;apos; from [[Northern Ireland]], on 2 March 1936 in [[Belfast]] and again on 2 June 1937 in front of a home crowd in [[Glasgow]].

In 1937 he handed legendary English puncher [[Peter Kane]] his first loss (KO).

By 1938, Lynch&amp;apos;s drinking lifestyle meant that he could no longer make the weight for the flyweight division. He lost his world flyweight title to American [[Jackie Jurich]], when he weighed in at 118.5&amp;amp;nbsp;lb (53.8&amp;amp;nbsp;kg), half a pound over the [[bantamweight]] limit. This was made sadder by the fact that, despite his weight problems, Lynch stopped Jurich in the 12th round.

Lynch&amp;apos;s boxing career was over by the time he was 25 and he battled with alcoholism for the rest of his life. He died in 1946 from malnutrition, aged 33.

His record for the seven years of his professional career was:
:Total Bouts: 102
:Won: 77 (includes 15 knockouts)
:Lost: 10 (one knockout, in his last fight)
:Draw: 15

He was inducted into the [[International Boxing Hall Of Fame]] in 1998. A film about the life of Benny Lynch, directed by [[John Mackenzie (director)|John Mackenzie]] and starring [[Robert Carlyle]], was made in 2003.

He was featured on the cover of Scottish rock band [[Gun (band)|Gun]]&amp;apos;s second album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Gallus (album)|Gallus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in 1992.
