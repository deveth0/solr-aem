&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Beornwulf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (died 826) was [[List of monarchs of Mercia|King]] of [[Mercia]] (now the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] of [[England]]) from 823 to 826. His short reign saw the collapse of [[Mercian Supremacy|Mercia&amp;apos;s supremacy]] over the kingdoms of the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Heptarchy]].

Beornwulf&amp;apos;s ancestry is practically unknown. His father was a Mercian nobleman, ealdorman Beorhtweald (died 796). A man named Beornwulf is mentioned as having witnessed a charter of King [[Coenwulf of Mercia|Coenwulf]] in 812 and another of King [[Ceolwulf I of Mercia|Ceolwulf]] in 823, but his position on each of these charters suggests he was not of an exceptionally high rank.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Frank Stenton, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anglo-Saxon England&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1943, 1971, 1998 Oxford paperback), page 231, note 1.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Ceolwulf I was overthrown in 823, and Beornwulf became king. [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] was conquered by the Mercians at about this time, but it is unclear which of the two kings was ruling when it occurred. It has been argued that the known record suggests Beornwulf was more vigorous and likely to wage such a campaign than Ceolwulf, and that the conquest of Powys may have therefore been accomplished by Beornwulf at the beginning of his rule.&amp;lt;ref name=Kirby&amp;gt;D. P. Kirby, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Earliest English Kings&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1991, 2000 paperback), Routledge, pages 154&amp;amp;ndash;155.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Soon after he rebuilt the Abbey of St. Peter (later [[Gloucester Cathedral]]). He presided over two synods at [[Clofesho]] (an unknown location believed to be near London) with archbishop [[Wulfred]] of [[Canterbury]], in 824 and 825.

From their recent success against the Welsh, it can be judged that the Mercian army was a formidable force. It must have been with a high degree of confidence, therefore, that, in 825, Beornwulf marched against the West Saxon’s, but was badly defeated at the battle of [[Ellandun]] at the hands of their king Egbert, fought at present day [[Wroughton]] near [[Swindon]], [[Wiltshire]]. Ecgbert&amp;apos;s son [[Ethelwulf of Wessex|Æðelwulf]] subsequently invaded [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] and drove out its pro-Mercian king, [[Baldred of Kent|Baldred]].

In the wake of these events, Mercia&amp;apos;s dominance of southern England rapidly unravelled. [[Essex]] and [[Sussex]] switched their loyalty to Egbert. The [[East Anglia|East Angles]], led by [[Aethelstan of East Anglia|Athelstan]] and backed by the West Saxons, exploited the moment of weakness by rebelling against Mercian rule, and Beornwulf was killed attempting to crush the revolt. One extant charter of Beornwulf refers to his third regnal year, 825.

A silver penny coinage of Beornwulf was struck during his reign. These coins are very rare indeed today, with only around twenty-five examples known to exist.
