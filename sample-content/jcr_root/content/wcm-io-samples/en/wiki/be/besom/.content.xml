A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;besom&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a traditionally constructed sweeping brush made of a bundle of twigs tied to a stouter pole. They are still made today and sold at gardening stores as outdoor brooms.  The twigs could be [[Broom (shrub)|broom]], [[Calluna|heather]] or similar.  The song [[Broom Buzzems|Buy Broom Buzzems]] from Northern England refers to both types of twig.  From the phrase &amp;apos;&amp;apos;broom besom&amp;apos;&amp;apos; the more common [[broom]] comes.

== Construction ==

As a result of its construction around a central pole, the brush of the besom is rounded instead of flat. The bristles can be made of many materials including, but not limited to straw, herbs, or twigs. Traditionally the handle is of hazel wood and the head is of birch twigs. Modern construction uses bindings of wire and string (instead of the traditional split [[withy]]) and the head is secured by a steel nail instead of a wooden dowel.

== Uses ==

Besoms are the [[broomstick]]s traditionally associated with [[witch]]es.

A besom is one of the tools used in [[Wicca]]. A traditional Wiccan besom is an [[ash tree|ash]] stave handle with bristles made from [[birch]] twigs. These twigs are tied on using thin pieces of [[willow]] wood. It is used to cleanse the ritual area before circle casting.

As a tool, the besom is usually thought of as masculine in nature due to its [[phallic]] shape and symbolism. However the besom&amp;apos;s components are of both masculine and feminine orientation. The handle, an ash stave, is masculine in nature while the birch used for the bristles is thought of as feminine in nature.  The besom is thought to be involved with fairies.

The besom is an important part of Wiccan [[handfasting]] ceremonies in some traditions. The couple [[Jumping the broom|jump over the besom]] during the ceremony. Alternatively, the couple may jump over a small [[bonfire]].

===Besoms and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;flying&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;===

{{Main|Flying ointment}}

There is a theory that the origin of the idea of witches flying with their brooms is based in a ritual involving a [[psychoactive drug]] trip.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1344/whats-the-deal-with-witches-and-broomsticks| title=What&amp;apos;s the deal with witches and broomsticks?| date=September 3, 1999| first=Cecil| last=Adams| accessdate=3 March 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The witches would prepare a [[flying ointment]] to aid them in their journey. There are many recipes for this ointment all having a base of either &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Atropa belladonna]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Mandragora officinarum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, both highly psychoactive drugs producing visions and encouraging astral projection.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; http://www.shanmonster.com/witch/flying.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; {{tl|linkrot}}  Some speculate the ointment was applied to the end of the Besom and administered vaginally.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Witches mounted broomsticks and would leap around the fields, hallucinating with the aid of the flying ointment, in order to &amp;quot;teach the crops how high to grow&amp;quot;. The ointment would give them [[hallucinations]], which made them believe that they flew distances.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite book| title=The Book Of The Sacred Magic Of Abramelin The Mage| year=2004| author=&amp;quot;of Worms Abraham ben Simeon&amp;quot;| authorlink=The Book of Abramelin| editor-link=S.
