&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ignatius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Игнатий&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}, {{lang-el|Ιγνάτιος}}) (1540–1620) was a [[Russian Orthodox]] [[bishop]] of [[Greeks|Greek]] descent who was the second [[Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia]] in 1605-1606, even though his status is now disputed and he is frequently omitted from the list of Patriarchs of Moscow by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

Ignatius was reported to be of [[Cretan]] descent. He came to [[Russia]] in 1595 as a member of an [[ecclesiastic]] mission, sent by the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]]. He took part in the [[coronation]] of [[Boris Godunov]]. In the early 17th century, Ignatius was appointed [[Archbishop]] of [[Ryazan]]. After the death of Godunov, he expressed support to [[False Dmitriy I]] and, even before the pretender  reached [[Moscow]], was swearing in his supporters in [[Tula, Russia|Tula]]. On June 30, 1605, Ignatius was elected [[patriarch]] by the council of bishops to replace [[Patriarch Jove|Patriarch Job]], who was sent into exile for refusing to acknowledge the pretender&amp;apos;s rights for [[Russia]]n [[throne]]. Ignatius performed the [[coronation]] of [[False Dmitriy I]] on July 21, 1605 and later also celebrated the [[coronation]] of his wife [[Marina Mnishek]] and their [[marriage]]. At that time, Ignatius was also an ardent opponent of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Unia]].

After the [[assassination]] of False Dmitriy I, Ignatius was removed from his see and confined in the [[Chudov Monastery]] by the order of [[Vasili IV of Russia|Tsar Vasili IV]]. In 1610, patriarch Ignatius supported [[False Dmitriy II]]. In 1611, he was freed from the monastery by the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish]] occupation forces of [[Moscow]] and went to [[Poland]], where he would later settle in [[Vilnius|Wilno (Vilnius)]]. At that time he also converted from [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]] to [[Greek Catholicism|Byzantine Russian Rite Catholicism]], thus entering into the [[full communion]] with the [[Pope]].

Due to his active role in the installation of [[False Dmitriy I]] to the [[Tsar of Russia|Moscow throne]] and later conversion to the [[Unia]], Ignatius has suffered from [[damnatio memoriae]] in subsequent ages and often is not counted among the legitimate patriarchs by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].  Even though his predecessor [[Patriarch Jove|Patriarch Job]] was removed from his post by force, the legitimacy of Ignatius&amp;apos; election and his status as [[patriarch]] was not questioned by his contemporaries.
