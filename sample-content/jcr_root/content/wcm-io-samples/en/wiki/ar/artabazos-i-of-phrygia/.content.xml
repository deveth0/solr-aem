        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Artabazus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Persian language|Persian]]:آرتابازوس, {{lang-grc|[[wikt:Ἀρτάβαζος|Ἀρτάβαζος]]}}; fl. 480 BC - 455 BC) was the name of a [[satrap]] of [[Hellespont]]ine [[Phrygia]] (now northwest [[Turkey]]), under the [[Achaemenid]] dynasty of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]].

Artabazus, son of [[Pharnaces (satrap)|Pharnaces]], was one of the generals in [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]]&amp;apos; [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|invasion]] of [[Greece]], in charge of the reserve forces guarding the route back to Asia, and responsible for suppressing a revolt in [[Potidaea]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+8.126.1 Herodotus 8,126-129]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The invasion ended with [[Mardonius]], ignoring advice from Artabazus and others, meeting the Greeks in pitched battle at [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]] and being defeated (479 BC).  The Greeks followed up their victory by sailing to [[Ionia]], where they destroyed the garrisoning forces under [[Tigranes]] at [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]] in the same year.  Artabazus, however, managed to lead the remnant portion of a greatly reduced Persian army out of Greece and back to Ionia.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+9.89.1 Herodotus 9,89]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; According to [[Herodotus]] and [[Plutarch]] this force consisted of 40,000 men. Herodotus claims in Thessaly he did not reveal the defeat as he would have been attacked, but claimed he needed to go to [[Thrace]] on a special mission. He was able to return to Persian territory despite losing men in attacks in Thrace.

As a reward, Artabazus was made satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia.  This office was passed down to his descendants.  He was succeeded by his son, Pharnabazus ([[floruit|fl.]] 455 BC - 430 BC), of whom little is known, and then by his grandson [[Pharnaces II of Phrygia]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;fl.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 430 BC - 413 BC), who is known to have been satrap at the outset of the [[Peloponnesian War]].  Pharnaces was in turn succeeded by his son, another [[Pharnabazus (5th century BC)|Pharnabazus]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;fl.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 413 BC - 373 BC), who is well known for his rivalry with [[Tissaphernes]] and wars against the [[Sparta]]ns.
