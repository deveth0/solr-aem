&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Charles Archibald &amp;quot;Archie&amp;quot; Hahn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (September 14, 1880 &amp;amp;ndash; January 21, 1955) was a [[German American|German-American]] [[Athletics (sport)|athlete]], and one of the best sprinters in the early 20th century.

Having won sprint events at the 1903 American and Canadian championships, Hahn&amp;amp;mdash;born in [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin]], but running for the [[University of Michigan]]&amp;amp;mdash;was among the favourites at the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympic Games]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], which was poorly attended by [[Europe]]an athletes.

In the first event at those Games, the 60 m, Hahn benefited from his quick start and won, making him a favourite for the remaining events he was entered in, the 100 m and 200 m. His run in the 200 m final delivered him the gold and a good time, although the latter was flattered, because the race was run on a straight course. In his third event, he again outclassed the field, thus winning all sprint events.

In [[Athletics at the 1906 Intercalated Games|1906]], the &amp;quot;Milwaukee Meteor&amp;quot; repeated his Olympic 100 m victory in Athens, a feat not equalled until 1988, when [[Carl Lewis]] won the 100 m twice in a row (albeit after disqualification of [[Ben Johnson (athlete)|Ben Johnson]]).

After his running career, Archie Hahn became a coach and wrote the classic book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;How to Sprint&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Archie coached the [[University of Virginia]] Cavaliers to 12 state championships in 13 years.  He died in 1955, in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].

He was elected to the [[Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame]] in 1959.

Hahn was inducted into the [[University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor]] in 1984 and the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1991.
