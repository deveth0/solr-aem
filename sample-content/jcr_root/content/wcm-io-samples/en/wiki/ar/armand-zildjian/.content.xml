&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Armand Zildjian&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 18, 1921 - December 26, 2002) was an American manufacturer of [[cymbal]]s and the head of the [[Avedis Zildjian Company]].

Born in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], Armand Zildjian was the scion of a cymbals-making tradition that dated back to his ancestor Avedis, who began the company in 1623 in [[Istanbul]].  By family tradition, the secrets of cymbal making were passed on only to the oldest son, but Armand&amp;apos;s father, Avedis Zildjian III, gave the information to both of his sons, Armand and Robert.  This began a legal battle which ended only when Robert formed the [[Sabian (company)|Sabian]] Cymbals Company, in competition with his brother.

Armand Zildjian attended [[Colgate University]], and served with the [[United States Coast Guard]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] during World War II.  After the war, he returned to his father&amp;apos;s factory in [[Norwell, Massachusetts]], where, with the help of such music business stars as [[Chick Webb]] and [[Gene Krupa]], he revolutionized the cymbals business by adding them to drum sets and making them thinner.

Zildjian has an honorary degree from [[Berklee College of Music]], is an inductee into the [[Percussive Hall of Fame]], and has his name immortalized on the [[Guitar Center Rock Walk]] in Hollywood, California.

Armand has four children: Craigie, Debbie, Wendy, and Rab. Craigie is CEO of the Zildjian Company and Rab lives in England. More can be found on the Zildjian website.
