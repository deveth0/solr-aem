&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Artie Matthews&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (November 15, 1888 &amp;amp;ndash; October 25, 1958) was a [[songwriter]], [[pianist]], and [[ragtime]] composer.

Artie Matthews was born in [[Braidwood, Illinois]]; his family moved to [[Springfield, Illinois]] in his youth. He learned to play piano, mostly popular songs and light classics, until he heard ragtime played by a pianist named Banty Morgan about 1905. Matthews was fascinated and immersed himself in ragtime and started playing and writing numbers in the style. In 1908 he moved to the ragtime center of [[St. Louis, Missouri]], which would be one of his bases, frequently alternating with [[Chicago, Illinois]]. He worked as a pianist, arranger, and wrote music for local theater productions.

In early 1913 music publisher [[John Stillwell Stark|John Stark]] heard Matthews and offered him 50 [[United States dollar|dollars]] each for any original rags he submitted for publication. Matthews also worked as an arranger for Starks.

In 1916 Artie Matthews moved to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], where he first worked as a church organist. In 1921 Matthews and his wife Anna Howard founded the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cosmopolitan School of Music&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a music school for [[African American]]s, where Matthews taught until his death. Among Matthews students was [[Frank Foster (musician)|Frank Foster]], who would become the principal arranger for the [[Count Basie]] orchestra.

Some rank Artie Matthews with [[Scott Joplin]], [[Joseph Lamb]], and [[James Scott (musician)|James Scott]] as one of the finest and most sophisticated ragtime composers. His most famous rags are the &amp;quot;Pastime Rags&amp;quot;, numbered 1 to 5. His 1912 &amp;apos;&amp;apos; Baby Seals Blues&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was one of the first published [[Blues]]. His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Weary Blues]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; remains a standard by [[Dixieland]] and [[New Orleans]] [[jazz]] bands.
