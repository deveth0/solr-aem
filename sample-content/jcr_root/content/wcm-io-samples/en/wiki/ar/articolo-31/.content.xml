&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Articolo 31&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a popular band from [[Milan]], [[Italy]], melding [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[funk]], pop and traditional [[Italy|Italian]] musical forms.  They are one of the most popular Italian rock/hip hop groups.

==Band history==
Members are rapper [[J-Ax]] (real name Alessandro Aleotti) and DJ Jad (Vito Luca Perrini). The band took its name from the [[Ireland|Irish]] constitutional [[Censorship_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland#The_Troubles|law]] guaranteeing freedom of the press{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Articolo 31&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was one of the first hip hop groups in Italy, releasing one of the first Italian hip hop records, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Strade di città&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in 1993. Soon, they signed with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG Ricordi]] and started to mix their rap with pop music, obtaining great success and popularity. However, the underground hip hop scene positioned them as traitors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Their producer was Franco Godi, who also produced the music for the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Signor Rossi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; animated series.

In 1997, [[DJ Gruff]] dissed Articolo 31 in a track titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;1 vs 2&amp;apos;&amp;apos; appearing on the first album of the beatmaker Fritz da Cat, but Articolo 31&amp;apos;s [[lawyer]]s obtained a retraction of the record, and its reissue without the song.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In 2001, Articolo 31 collaborated with the American [[old school hip hop|old school]] rapper [[Kurtis Blow]] on the album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;XChé SI!&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In the same year, they made the movie &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Senza filtro&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (in English, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;Without filter&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

With &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Domani smetto&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Articolo 31 left the world of hip hop and moved to rap with many influences; even more so than previously, this album found them rapping and singing to rock and pop tracks.

In recent years, J Ax and DJ Jad have each released solo records, and in 2006, the group declared an indefinite [[Recess (break)|hiatus]].

Their posse, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Spaghetti Funk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, includes other popular performers like Space One and pop rappers [[Gemelli DiVersi]].
