&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Archibald Alison&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;lt;small&amp;gt;[[Fellow of the Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;  (1757–1839) was a Scottish [[Scottish Episcopal Church|episcopalian]] priest and essayist.

==Early life==
He was born at Edinburgh on 13 November 1757, to [[Patrick Alison]],{{dubious|date=December 2010}} the [[Provost (religion)|provost]] of the [[Diocese of Edinburgh]], himself a younger son of an Alison of Newhall, near [[Coupar Angus]].

After studying at the [[University of Glasgow]], where he established his lifelong friendship with [[Dugald Stewart]], and at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], he took orders in the [[Church of England]], and was appointed in 1778 to the [[curacy]] of [[Brancepeth]], near [[Durham]]. In 1784 he married Dorothea, youngest daughter of [[John Gregory (moralist)|Professor Gregory]] of Edinburgh.

==Career==
The next twenty years of his life were spent in [[Shropshire]], where he held in succession the livings of [[High Ercall]], [[Roddington]] and [[Kenley, Shropshire|Kenley]]. In 1800 he moved back to Edinburgh, having been appointed senior incumbent of St Paul&amp;apos;s Chapel in the [[Cowgate]]. For thirty-four years he filled this position with much ability; his sermons were characterised by quiet beauty of thought and grace of composition.  His preaching attracted so many hearers that a new and larger church was built for him.

His last years were spent at [[Colinton]] near Edinburgh, where he died on 17 May, 1839. He was interred at [[St John&amp;apos;s Episcopal Churchyard]] in Edinburgh.

==Works==
Alison published, besides a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Life of Lord Woodhouselee&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a volume of sermons, which passed through several editions, and a work entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1790), based on the principle of &amp;quot;association&amp;quot;. His elder son, Dr [[William Pulteney Alison]] (1790–1859), was a distinguished Edinburgh medical professor. His younger son was the historian [[Sir Archibald Alison, 1st Baronet]].
