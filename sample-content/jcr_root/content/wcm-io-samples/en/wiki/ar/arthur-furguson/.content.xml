{{For|those of a similar name|Arthur Ferguson (disambiguation)}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arthur Furguson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1883&amp;amp;ndash;1938) was (or may have been) a Scottish [[con artist]] who allegedly became known for &amp;quot;selling&amp;quot; English national monuments and other government property to visiting American tourists during the 1920s.

It is claimed that in the 1920s, Furguson sold monuments such as [[Nelson&amp;apos;s Column]] in [[Trafalgar Square]] (for the sum of £6,000), [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]] (£1,000 for a down payment), and [[Buckingham Palace]] (£2,000 for a down payment) to American tourists.

Furguson emigrated to the USA in 1925. He sold the [[White House]] to a rancher on the [[hire purchase|installment plan]] for yearly payments of $100,000, and tried to sell the [[Statue of Liberty]] to a visiting Australian, who went to the police. Furguson was imprisoned and was released in 1930. He continued to defraud people in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] until his death in 1938.

However, according to author Dane Love, who profiled Furguson in his book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Man Who Sold Nelson&amp;apos;s Column&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the existence of Furguson himself may be a hoax. Love attempted to trace contemporary records which would confirm the story, but found &amp;quot;[t]here was nothing about his arrest, his trial or his time in jail in New York. There&amp;apos;s not even any trace of his grave in Los Angeles, where he supposedly died in 1938.&amp;quot; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/tv-showbiz-news/entertainment-news/2009/02/08/tv-quiz-host-stephen-fry-duped-by-story-of-fictional-scots-conman-78057-21105696/ |title=TV quiz host Stephen Fry duped by story of fictional Scots conman - The Daily Record |publisher=Sundaymail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The earliest known reference to Furguson dates from as recently as the 1970s.
