        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arnold Dreyblatt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (b. [[New York City]], 1953) is an [[United States|American]] [[composer]] and visual artist.  He studied music with [[Pauline Oliveros]], [[La Monte Young]], [[Alvin Lucier]] (at [[Wesleyan University]]) and media art with [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]]. In 1982 Dreyblatt obtained his Master&amp;apos;s degree in composition from Wesleyan University.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.wesleyan.edu/music/graduate/theses.html M.A. Theses in Ethnomusicology and Composition], Wesleyan University. Department of Music. Dreyblatt, Arnold, 1982. Retrieved January 30, 2013.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He has been based in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] since 1984. In 2007, he was elected to the German Academy of Art ([[Akademie der Künste]], Berlin).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p144243|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic biography]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In his installations, performances and media works, Dreyblatt creates complex textual and spatial metaphors for memory which function as a media discourse on recollection and the archive. His installations, public artworks and performances have been exhibited and staged extensively in Europe.  &amp;quot;Dreyblatt&amp;apos;s project, maintains its edge--and its importance for the rethinking of identity, history, culture, and memory--by refusing to retreat from or transcend [...] public, archival traces.&amp;quot; - Jeffrey Wallen, [[Hampshire College]].

Among the second generation of New York [[Minimalist music|minimal]] composers, Arnold Dreyblatt has developed a unique approach to composition and music performance. He has invented a set of new and original instruments, performance techniques, and a system of tuning. His compositions are based on [[harmonic]]s, and thus [[just intonation]], played either through a bowing technique he developed for his modified bass, and other modified and conventional instruments which he specially [[Musical tuning|tuned]]. He originally used a steady [[Pulse (music)|pulse]] provided by the [[bow (music)|bow]]ing motion on his bass (placing his music in the [[minimalist music|minimal]] category), but he eventually added many more instruments and more [[rhythm]]ic variety.

In 1998 he was awarded a grant from the [[Foundation for Contemporary Arts]] Grants to Artists Award.

Dreyblatt&amp;apos;s mother, [[Lucille Wallenrod]] (1918–1998), was a painter.
