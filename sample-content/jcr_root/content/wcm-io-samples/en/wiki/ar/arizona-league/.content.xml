The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arizona League&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[minor league baseball]] league that operates in and around [[Phoenix, Arizona]].  It is a Rookie-level league run by [[Major League Baseball]] since 1989.  Along with the [[Gulf Coast League]], it forms the lowest rung of the minor-league system. Games are played at the spring training complexes of the team&amp;apos;s parent organizations from mid-June until the end of August. Night games are commonly played in the spring training stadium, but this is not always the case.  The regular season is 56 games.

Teams primarily consist of players from the [[Dominican Republic]] and recently drafted high school and college players, and are owned by their parent clubs. Most of the players have just been selected in that year&amp;apos;s entry draft, two to three weeks before the league begins its season.  The league is also where major league players often go for their first rehab assignments.  No official attendance records are kept as there is no paid admittance fee, and no concessions are sold.  However, few spectators show up, as games are typically played in temperatures above 100°F.  The high temperatures do not affect either quality or competition, as the players are primarily there to hone their skills rather than win games.  For this reason, Arizona League games, like their GCL counterparts, are among the least competitive of minor league games.

The three division winners will be joined by a Wild Card team in the playoffs. The team with the best record will meet the Wild Card team and the other two division winners will meet in one-game playoffs. The two winners will meet in a championship game.

Bob Richmond is the league president. The league offices are in [[Boise, Idaho]].
