&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arnulf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a masculine [[German given name]].
It is composed of the [[Germanic names|Germanic]] elements &amp;apos;&amp;apos;arn&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;eagle&amp;quot; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ulf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;wolf&amp;quot;.
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;-ulf, -olf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; suffix was an extremely frequent element in Germanic onomastics and from an early time was perceived as a mere suffix forming given names. Similarly, the suffix &amp;apos;&amp;apos;-wald, -ald, -old&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, originally from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;wald&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;quot;rule, power&amp;quot; underwent semantic weakening.
Therefore, the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arnulf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Arnold]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were often conflated in early medieval records, as is the case with bishop [[Arnulf of Metz]] (died 640), especially as the final consonant came to be dropped (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arnoul&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

The name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arnulf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is attested from as early as the 5th century, as the name of the brother of [[Odoacer]].  The name is attested with some frequency in [[Medieval Germany]] throughout the 8th to 11th centuries, in the spelling variants &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arnulf, Arnulph, Arnolf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, occasionally also as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arenulph, Harnulf, Harnolf, Harnolph&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
In the 9th century, [[Arnulf of Carinthia]] was the ruler of [[East Francia]] and was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 896.

There was an Anglo-Saxon cognate, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earnulf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Ernulf]]), which was assimilated to the Frankish form of the name after the Norman conquest. [[Arnulf of Eynesbury]] is an obscure 9th-century English saint, who was mostly forgotten by the 11th century, and who was perhaps just a folkloristic duplicate of the historical Arnulf of Metz. In any case, the English Arnulf would have been known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earnulf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and his relics were venerated in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earnulfesbyrig&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Eynesbury, Cambridgeshire]]).
The name is also attested in medieval Scandinavia, as [[Old Norse]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arnúlfr&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ærnulfr, Ǫrnólfr, Ǫrnulfr&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Old Swedish &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ærinolf, Ærnolf, Ärnulf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nordicnames.de/wiki/ArnulfR nordicnames.de], citing Lena Peterson, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nordiskt runnamnslexikon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2002).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Scandinavian dialectal and regional variants of the name include &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Annul, Annulv, Anul, Arnolv, Arnulv, Örnólfur, Ørnolvur, Örnulf, Ørnulf, Ørnulv&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The given name Arnulf remains in use in Germany and in Norway, and to a lesser extent in Sweden.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nordicnames.de/w/index.php?title=Arnulf nordicnames.de]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
