&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arachnology&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the [[science|scientific]] study of [[spider]]s and related animals such as [[scorpion]]s, [[Pseudoscorpionida|pseudoscorpions]], [[Opiliones|harvestmen]], collectively called [[arachnid]]s. However, the study of [[tick]]s and [[mite]]s is sometimes not included in arachnology, but is called [[Acarology]]. Those who study spiders and other arachnids are &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;arachnologists&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[wiktionary:arachnology|arachnology]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; derives from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀράχνη}}, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;arachnē&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;spider&amp;quot;; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[-logy|-logia]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Arachnology as a science==
Arachnologists are primarily responsible for classifying arachnids and studying aspects of their biology. In the popular imagination they are sometimes referred to as &amp;apos;spider experts&amp;apos;. Disciplines within arachnology include naming species and determining their evolutionary relationships to one another (taxonomy and systematics), studying how they interact with other members of their species and/or their environment (behavioural ecology), or how they are distributed in different regions and habitats (faunistics). Other arachnologists carry out research into the anatomy or physiology of arachnids, including the venom of spiders and scorpions. Others study the impact of spiders in agricultural ecosystems and whether they can be used as biological control agents.

==Arachnological societies==
Arachnologists are served by a number of scientific societies, both national and international in scope. Their main role is to encourage the exchange of ideas between researchers, to organise meetings and congresses, and in a number of cases to publish academic journals. Some are also involved in outreach programs, like the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;European spider of the year&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which raise awareness of these animals among the general public.

==Arachnological journals==
[[Scientific journal]]s devoted to the study of arachnids include:

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[http://www.entomoljournal.com/ Journal of Entomology and Zoology Studies]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

==Popular arachnology==
In the 1970s, arachnids - particularly [[tarantulas]] - started to become popular as exotic pets. Many tarantulas thus become more widely known by their common names such as the [[Mexican redknee tarantula]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Brachypelma smithi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

Various societies now focus on the husbandry, care, study and captive breeding of tarantulas, and other arachnids. They also typically produce journals or newsletters with articles and advice on these subjects. Examples would be:

*[[American Tarantula Society]]
*[[British Tarantula Society]]
*[[Deutsche Arachnologische Gesellschaft]]
