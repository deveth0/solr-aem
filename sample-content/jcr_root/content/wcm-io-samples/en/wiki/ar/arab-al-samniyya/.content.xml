&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arab al-Samniyya&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ar|عرب السمنية}}), also known as Khirbat al-Suwwana, is a depopulated [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[village]] in the [[Galilee#Western Galilee|Western Galilee]] that was captured by [[Israel]] during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli war]]. It was located in the [[District of Acre|Acre District]] of the [[British Mandate of Palestine]], 19.5&amp;amp;nbsp;km northeast of the city of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. In 1945 the village had a population of 200 [[Arab]]s and a total land area of 1,872 [[dunam|dunums]].

==Before 1948==
The village was situated on a rocky hill near the road linking [[Ra´s al-Naqura]] with [[Safad]]. Its houses were made of stone. A dirt path linked it to the coastal highway and thence to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. The villagers cultivated grain, figs, and olives. In 1944/45 a total of 174 [[dunam]]s were allocated to grain crops; 22 dunums were irrigated and planted with orchards.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Khalidi, 1992, p.5&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==1948 War==
The village was captured by Israel&amp;apos;s [[7th Brigade (Israel)|7th]] and [[Carmeli Brigade|Carmeli]] Brigades on 31 October 1948 during the [[Israeli Defense Force]] offensive, [[Operation Hiram]]. The village was completely destroyed, and only building rubble left behind. The village remained depopulated of its inhabitants. In 1950, the [[Jewish settlement]] of [[Ya&amp;apos;ara]] was established on the depopulated land.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Khalidi, 1992, p.6&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
