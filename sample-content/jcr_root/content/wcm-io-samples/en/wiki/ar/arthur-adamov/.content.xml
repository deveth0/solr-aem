&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arthur Adamov&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (23 August 1908 – 15 March 1970) was a [[playwright]], one of the foremost exponents of the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].
==Life==
Adamov (originally Adamian) was born in [[Kislovodsk]] in [[Russia]] to a wealthy [[Armenians|Armenian]] family, which lost its wealth in 1917. In common with many other wealthy Russians of the time, Adamov was brought up with [[French language|French]] as his first language, and in 1924 he moved to [[Paris]].

In Paris Adamov met [[surrealist]]s and edited the surrealist journal &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Discontinuité]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He began to write [[Play (theatre)|plays]] after [[World War II]], with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[La Parodie]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1947) being his first. His work, influenced by [[Bertolt Brecht]], is often [[dream]]-like and later works in particular have a [[political]] element. The title character of one of his best known works, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Le Professeur Taranne]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1953), is accused of various things (public nudity, littering, plagiarism), all of which he strenuously denies, only to have his denials turned against him into more evidence of [[misdemeanours]]. This particular play was directly influenced by a dream Adamov had. Lesser known to the public is his prose work with short stories like &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fin Août&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Je... Ils...&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1969). Their themes revolve around topics like [[Sadomasochism|masochism]], which the author regarded as &amp;quot;immunisation against death&amp;quot;. Adamov translated a number of works by German authors (Rilke, Büchner) and Russian classics (Gogol, Chekhov) into French. During his later years, he began to [[alcohol|drink]] and use drugs.

Adamov&amp;apos;s death in 1970 (Paris) may have been the result of an accidental [[suicide]] by taking an overdose of [[barbiturates]].
