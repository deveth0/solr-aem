&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arame&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aramu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Արամ) (ruled [[858 BC|858]]–844 BC) was the first known [[monarch|king]] of [[Urartu]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com/books?ei=1YvpS6HSDsH98AbyhfTsDg&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;id=F_IEAQAAIAAJ&amp;amp;dq=Aramu+Urartu&amp;amp;q=%22first+known%22#search_anchor &amp;apos;&amp;apos;History in Africa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;], Volume 2, p. 93. African Studies Association., 1975.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Living at the time of King [[Shalmaneser III]] of [[Assyria]] (ruled [[859 BC|859]]–824 BC), Arame united the [[Nairi]] tribe against the threat of the [[Assyrian Empire]]. His capital at [[Arzashkun]] was captured by Shalmaneser.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The Ancient Assyrians - Page 12 by Mark Healy&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Arame has been suggested as the prototype of both [[Aram (given name)|Aram]] (and, correspondingly the popular given name [[Aram (given name)|Aram]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Արամ&amp;quot; in H. Ačaṙean (1926-35), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hayocʿ Anjnanunneri Baṙaran&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Yerevan: Yerevan State University), 2nd ed., 1942-62&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) and [[Ara the Beautiful]], two of the legendary forefathers of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] people.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Lang (1970), p. 85.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Khorenatsi&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[History of Armenia (Moses of Chorene)|History]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1.5) puts them six and seven generations after [[Hayk|Haik]], in the chronology of historian [[Mikayel Chamchian]] dated to the 19th to 18th century BC.
