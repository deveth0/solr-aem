&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arsinoe III Philapator&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-grc|Ἀρσινόη ἡ Φιλοπάτωρ}}, which means &amp;quot;Arsinoe the father-loving&amp;quot;, 246 or 245 BC – 204 BC) was Queen of [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]] (220 – 204 BC). She was a daughter of [[Ptolemy III of Egypt|Ptolemy III]] and [[Berenice II of Egypt|Berenice II]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Thames &amp;amp; Hudson. 2004. ISBN 0-500-05128-3.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Between late October and early November 220 BC she was married to her brother, [[Ptolemy IV of Egypt|Ptolemy IV]]. She took active part in the government of the country, at least in the measure that it was tolerated by the all-powerful minister [[Sosibius]]. She rode at the head of infantry and cavalry to fight [[Antiochus the Great]] at the [[battle of Raphia]] in 217 BC. She was the mother of [[Ptolemy V]]. In summer, 204 BC she was murdered in a palace coup, shortly after the death of her husband.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.tyndalehouse.com/Egypt/ptolemies/arsinoe_iii_fr.htm Arsinoe III] by Chris Bennett&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
