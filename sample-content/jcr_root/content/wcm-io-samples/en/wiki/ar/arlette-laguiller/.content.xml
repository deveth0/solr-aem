&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arlette Yvonne Laguiller&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born March 18, 1940) is a [[France|French]] [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] politician. Since 1973, she has been the [[spokeswoman]] and the best known leader and [[perennial candidate]] of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Lutte Ouvrière]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (LO) [[political party]]. Known to most French people simply by her first name, Laguiller is committed to the cause of the [[Communist revolution]].

==Career==
Born at [[Les Lilas]], [[Seine-Saint-Denis]], [[France]], Arlette joined &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lutte Ouvrière&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1968, and became the leader of a 1974 bank workers&amp;apos; [[Strike action|strike]] that began with actions of employees at [[Crédit Lyonnais]].

She has been a frequent candidate for the [[President of the French Republic|French Presidency]], starting with [[French presidential election, 1974|the election of 1974]], and continuing through those of [[French presidential election, 1981|1981]], [[French presidential election, 1988|1988]], [[French presidential election, 1995|1995]], [[French presidential election, 2002|2002]], and [[French presidential election, 2007|2007]]. During most of these, Laguiller was the only female candidate. Her best result was in 2002 when she came in fifth place and received 5.72% of the vote. In December 2005, Laguiller announced that she would run for President for the sixth and final time [[2007 French presidential election|in 2007]]. After finishing a distant ninth in 2007&amp;apos;s first round of voting (487,857 votes, totaling 1.33% of the popular vote), for the first time since 1981 she endorsed the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] candidate ([[Ségolène Royal]]) for the second round. In the past, Laguiller and LO have often refrained from openly supporting the Socialist Party and taken a neutral stance in the second round.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiantribune.com/index.php?q=node/5436 |title=French presidential election: Sarkozy and Royal to compete in second round |publisher=Asian Tribune |date=2007-04-23 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Popular culture==

The [[Puppet|puppet show]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Les Guignols de l&amp;apos;info]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; frequently caricatures Arlette as saying &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Travailleurs, travailleuses ! On vous ment, on vous spolie !&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Female workers, male workers! You are being lied to, you are being robbed!&amp;quot;), using the fact that she would begin most of her many speeches with the formula &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Travailleuses, travailleurs!&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;.

In 1995, pop singer [[Alain Souchon]] recorded the song &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arlette Laguiller&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, commenting that &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Her words, of course, may be a little worn-out&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; but praising her &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;peppermint-fresh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; way of expressing them, and indicating that &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;When Arlette sings, you feel a real sense of love&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;. He has since lost his soft spot for Laguiller after she refused to back [[Jacques Chirac]] against [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] in the [[french presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential election]] and has stated that he won&amp;apos;t sing this song again.
