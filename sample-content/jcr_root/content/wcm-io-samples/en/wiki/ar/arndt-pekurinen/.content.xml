&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arndt Juho Pekurinen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (August 29, 1905 in [[Juva]], [[Finland]] – November 5, 1941 in [[Kalevalsky District|Kalevala district]], [[Soviet Union]], now [[Russia]]) was a [[Finnish people|Finnish]] [[pacifism|pacifist]] and [[conscientious objector]].

In 1926, Pekurinen repeatedly refused mandatory [[conscription]], leading to his imprisonment between 1929 and 1931. He refused to either wear a uniform or take arms. While Pekurinen was deeply religious, his motives were not based on his faith. While his contemporaries suggested he was [[Communist]], he was not interested in politics. Because of his pacifist conviction, in the atmosphere of the [[militarism|Militaristic]] thirties he was deemed as guilty of [[high treason]], and the [[Lapua movement]] harassed him relentlessly. In 1930, an international petition on his behalf was sent to the Finnish defense minister [[Juho Niukkanen]], which included the signatures of sixty [[Great Britain|British]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s and notables such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Henri Barbusse]] and [[H. G. Wells]]. On April 14, 1931, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lex Pekurinen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Finland&amp;apos;s first alternative to [[military service]], was passed. However, its provisions extended only as far as peacetime.

When the [[Winter War]] broke out in 1939, therefore, Pekurinen once again found himself imprisoned. At the onset of the [[Continuation War]] in autumn 1941, he was sent to the front, with orders to make sure he did wear the uniform, and bear and use a weapon. At the front he still refused to wear a uniform or bear arms. Following an order issued by Captain Pentti Valkonen, he was [[death penalty|executed]] without [[court-martial|trial]]. The first two soldiers (Sergeant Kivelä and Private Kinnunen) ordered to execute him refused; only the third, Corporal Asikainen, obeyed Valkonen&amp;apos;s direct order.

After the war, an investigation of Pekurinen&amp;apos;s death was begun but never completed. He remained effectively forgotten for over fifty years, until the publication in 1998 of the book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Courage: The life and execution of Arndt Pekurinen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Erno Paasilinna]]. The city of [[Helsinki]] named a park &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arndt Pekurisen puisto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The park of Arndt Pekurinen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) in his memory.

According to the book by Erno Paasilinna, Pekurinen&amp;apos;s motto was inspired by [[Jonathan Swift]]: &amp;quot;As people are not eaten, butchering them is of no use.&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kun ihmisiä ei syödä, on niitä turha teurastaa.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;)
