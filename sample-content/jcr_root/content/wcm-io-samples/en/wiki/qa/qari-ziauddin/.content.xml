Several hundred troops from the central government were sent to quell the fighting, which broke out February 5, 2004.
The central government own army only numbered 7,000 troops.

The [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] [[International Security Assistance Force]] had 200 [[Germany|German]] troops stationed in Badakhshan, but the [[Associated Press]] had been unable to reach them, for comment.&amp;lt;ref name=EAriana20040208/&amp;gt;
And stated that they were not believed to be involved in the incident.

==Death==
On October 5, 2010, an airstrike in northwestern [[Afghanistan]] killed [[Taliban]] leader, Qari Ziauddin, who was the Taliban&amp;apos;s shadow governor in [[Faryab]] province. He was &amp;quot;directly associated with and took direct operational orders from a Pakistan-based leader of the northern front,&amp;quot; according to NATO&amp;apos;s [[International Security Assistance Force]].   When coalition forces went to the site of the strike in Faryab province, armed people threatened them, &amp;quot;the security force engaged and killed four insurgents and confirmed Qari Ziauddin was killed during the airstrike,&amp;quot; according to the International Security Assistance Force.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://afghanistan.blogs.cnn.com/2010/10/06/airstrike-kills-taliban-leader-in-northwestern-afghanistan/?hpt=Sbin CNN: Airstrike kills Taliban leader in northwestern Afghanistan]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
