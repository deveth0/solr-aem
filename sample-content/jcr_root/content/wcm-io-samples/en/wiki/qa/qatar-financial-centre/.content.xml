The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Qatar Financial Centre&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (QFC) is a business and financial centre located in [[Doha]], providing legal and business infrastructure for financial services. It was established in March 2005.

The Qatar Financial Centre provides financial institutions with a world class financial services platform situated in an economy founded on the development of its hydrocarbons resources. It has been created with a long-term perspective to support the [[Economic development|development]] of Qatar and the [[Arabian Peninsula|wider region]], develop local and regional markets, and strengthen the links between the [[Petroleum industry|energy]] based economies and global [[financial market]]s.

== Background ==

While [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] will probably remain the backbone of Qatar&amp;apos;s economy for some time to come, the country seeks to stimulate the private sector and develop a [[knowledge economy]]. In 2004, it established the [[Qatar Science &amp;amp; Technology Park]] to attract and serve [[technology]]-based companies and entrepreneurs, from overseas and within Qatar. Qatar also established &amp;quot;education city&amp;quot; which consists of international colleges. For the 15th Asian Games in Doha in December 2006 it established a &amp;quot;sports city&amp;quot; consisting of Khalifa stadium, the [[ASPIRE Academy for Sports Excellence|Aspire Sports Academy]], aquatic centres, exhibition centres and many other sports related buildings and centres. Qatar also plans to build an &amp;quot;entertainment city&amp;quot; in the future.

Apart from Qatar itself, which needs to raise the capacity of its [[financial services]] to support more than $140 billion worth of projects, the QFC also provides a conduit for [[financial services]] providers to access nearly $1 trillion of investment across the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] as a whole over the next decade.
