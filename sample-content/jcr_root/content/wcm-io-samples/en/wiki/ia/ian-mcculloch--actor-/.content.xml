&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ian McCulloch&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 18 November 1939) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] actor.

He is best known for his role as Greg Preston in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Survivors (1975 TV series)|Survivors]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Though he debuted in the second episode, &amp;quot;Genesis&amp;quot;, Greg would become the male lead for the first series, and got to show off his singing and guitar playing in several episodes. However, he was unhappy with the introduction of [[Denis Lill]] as Charles Vaughan, a male co-lead, during the second series. McCulloch wrote the seventh episode of the second series, &amp;quot;A Friend in Need&amp;quot;, and was ostensibly written out at the end of that series. He would only appear twice in the third and final series, in the second episode &amp;quot;A Little Learning&amp;quot; and the tenth, &amp;quot;The Last Laugh&amp;quot;. He wrote the scripts for both episodes.

He guest starred in the 1984 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Doctor Who]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; story &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Warriors of the Deep]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and appeared in many popular television series in the 1970s, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Colditz (TV series)|Colditz]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (as the mysterious Larry Page in &amp;quot;Odd Man In&amp;quot;, 1974), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Secret Army (television)|Secret Army]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1977), and as the super physical fitness and close quarters combat intstructor of Bodie and Doyle in the 1979 series 3 episode &amp;quot;Mixed Doubles&amp;quot; in cult hit &amp;quot;The Professionals&amp;quot;.. He can also be seen in the lead role of cult [[Lucio Fulci]] gorefest &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Zombi II]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1979), released in the UK as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zombie Flesh Eaters&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The UK release was delayed as part of the 1980s campaign against &amp;quot;[[Video Nasties]]&amp;quot; - McCulloch would only see it years later when recording a commentary for the Roan Group&amp;apos;s [[Laserdisc]] release of Zombi 2 in 1998 and was shocked by the violence involved. He also played the part of David Mainwaring in [[Manhunt (1969 TV series)|Manhunt]].
