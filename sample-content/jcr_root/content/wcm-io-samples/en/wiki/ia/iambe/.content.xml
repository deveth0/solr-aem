        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Iambe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Greek mythology]] was a [[Thracian]] woman, daughter of [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]] and a servant of [[Metaneira]], the wife of [[Hippothoon]]. Others call her a slave of [[Celeus]], king of [[Eleusis]]. She is the Greek Goddess of Humor and Poetry whose bawdy jests roused the grieving Demeter from her profound depression during her search for her daughter Persephone.The extravagant hilarity displayed at the festivals of Demeter in Attica was traced to her, for it is said that when [[Demeter]], in her wanderings in search of her daughter, arrived in Attica, Iambe cheered the mournful goddess with her jokes (Horn. Hymn, in Cer. 202; Apollod. i. 5. § 1; Diod. v. 4; Phot. BibL Cod. 239. p.&amp;amp;nbsp;319, ed. Bekker; Schol. ad Nicand. Aleodph, 134.) She was believed to have given the name to [[Iambus (genre)|iambic poetry]], for some said that she hanged herself in consequence of the cutting speeches in which she had indulged, and others that she had cheered Demeter by a dance in the Iambic metre. (Eustath. ad Horn. p.&amp;amp;nbsp;1684.) [L. S.]
Iambe&amp;apos;s grandfather is Hermes.
