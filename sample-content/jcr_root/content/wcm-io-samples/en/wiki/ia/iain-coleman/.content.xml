&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Iain Coleman&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 18 January 1958) was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Hammersmith and Fulham (UK Parliament constituency)|Hammersmith and Fulham]] in [[London]] from 1997 to 2005. He was elected as a councillor in the London Borough of [[Hammersmith and Fulham]] for Shepherd&amp;apos;s Bush Green ward in May 2010.

Coleman was educated at [[Tonbridge School]]. He worked as a local government officer in the [[London Borough]]s of [[London Borough of Ealing|Ealing]] and [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]]. His mother and brother were councillors in [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]] and [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] respectively.

Coleman was a councillor on Hammersmith and Fulham Council 1986-97, serving as Leader 1991-96 and Mayor from 1996 to 1997. When [[Chief Whip]] of the [http://www.hflabour.org.uk Labour] Group, he had resigned over service cuts.
He was first elected as an MP in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], and retained the highly marginal seat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]].

He announced on 14 March 2005, that he would not be contesting the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|May 2005 general election]], due to ill health. [[Melanie Smallman]] was subsequently selected by the local [[Constituency Labour Party]] to replace him as candidate but was unsuccessful, losing to [[Greg Hands]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Coleman subsequently stood for Labour in the [[UK local elections, 2006|May 2006 local election]] for the North End ward, but failed to gain a seat, the Conservatives making a clean sweep of the ward.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/Council_and_Democracy/Democracy_and_Elections/4_May_2006_Council_Elections/Results/57262_North_End_ward_detailed_results.asp&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; However he was elected to as a councillor for Shepherds Bush Green ward at the [[Uk local elections 2010|May 2010 local elections]].
