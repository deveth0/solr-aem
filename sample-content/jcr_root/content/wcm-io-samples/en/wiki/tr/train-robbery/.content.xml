&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Train robbery&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a type of [[robbery]], in which the goal is to steal [[money]] or other valuables being carried aboard [[train]]s. A person engaged in robbing trains is known as a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;train robber.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

==History==
{{tone|date=March 2013}}
Train robberies were more common in the past than today, and often occurred in the [[American Old West]]. Trains carrying [[payroll]] shipments were a major target. These shipments would be guarded by an [[expressman]] whose duty it was to protect the cargo of the &amp;quot;[[Baggage car|express car]]&amp;quot;. Expressmen, [[Conductor (transportation)|conductors]], and other [[personnel]] took enormous pride in their duty and had no problem with risking their lives for a shipment{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.

[[Bandit]]s would rely on the expressman to open the [[safe]] and provide the goods. Without the combination required for the [[combination lock]], it was almost impossible to break into the [[safe]]s.  However, the invention of [[dynamite]] made it much easier to break into safes and rob the train. If the outlaw was unsatisfied with the goods, passengers of the [[train]]&amp;apos;s [[carriage]]s, who were generally unarmed, would be held at [[gun]]point and forced to hand over any valuables they were carrying, usually in the form of [[jewelry]] or [[currency]].

Contrary to the method romanticized by [[Hollywood]], outlaws were never known to jump from [[horseback]] onto a moving train. Usually, they would either board the train and wait for a good time to initiate the [[Robbery|heist]], or they would stop or [[Derailment|derail]] the train and then begin the holdup.

Famous train robbers include [[Bill Miner]], [[Jesse James]], and [[Butch Cassidy]]. Jesse James is mistakenly thought to have completed the first successful train robbery in the [[American West]] when on July 21, 1873 the [[James-Younger Gang]] took US $3,000 from a [[Rock Island Railroad]] train after derailing it southwest of the town of [[Adair, Iowa]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rits.org/www/histories/jjstory/JJ.html |title=James Train Robbery |publisher=Rits.org |date=1985-08-07 |accessdate=2012-06-08}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; However, the first peacetime train robbery in the United States actually occurred on October 6, 1866, when robbers boarded the Ohio &amp;amp; Mississippi train shortly after it left [[Seymour, Indiana]]. They broke into one safe and tipped the other off the train before jumping off. The [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]] later traced the crime to the [[Reno Gang]]. There was one earlier train robbery in May 1865, but because it was committed by armed guerrillas and occurred shortly after the end of the Civil War, it is not considered to be the first peacetime train robbery in the United States. Some sources say that the May 1865 robbery took place at a water siding while the train was stopped taking on water.
