&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Trampling&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  refers to the sexual activity that involves being trampled underfoot by another person or persons. Trampling is common enough to support a  [[sub-genre]] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;trampling pornography&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Because trampling can be used to produce pain, the trampling fetish for some adherents is closely linked to [[sadomasochistic]] fetishism.

A similar fetish is to imagine themselves as being tiny under another&amp;apos;s feet, or being normal size, but being trampled by a giant person.  This is known as &amp;quot;giant/giantess fetishism&amp;quot; or [[macrophilia]].  It is not the same as trampling.

The most common form of trampling is done by a male or female walking on a male or female [[submissive]] and is usually done barefooted, in socks, nylons, or shoes. The trampler will predominantly walk, jump and stomp on the person&amp;apos;s back, chest, stomach, genitalia, face and in some rare instances, the neck.
