This treaty was independently formulated under the administration of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Warren G. Harding]], who had defeated the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate, [[James M. Cox]], in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1920|1920 presidential election]]. Cox had supported the contentious clauses of the Treaty of Versailles that established a [[League of Nations]]. Within days, the United States also signed separate treaties with Austria&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/uspeacetreaty_austria.htm Primary Documents - U.S. Peace Treaty with Austria, 24 August 1921]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and Hungary.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/uspeacetreaty_hungary.htm Primary Documents - U.S. Peace Treaty with Hungary, 29 August 1921]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
