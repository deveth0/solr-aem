==Video==
The [[music video]] for &amp;quot;Trigger&amp;quot; showed In Flames playing in a club and being constantly pestered and booed by the members of [[Soilwork]], with interspersed footage of other incidents between the two bands. Soilwork&amp;apos;s video for &amp;quot;Rejection Role&amp;quot; showed the situation &amp;apos;&amp;apos;vice versa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Soilwork playing and In Flames as the bullies. The colour is also reversed in each video: blue for In Flames, red for Soilwork. Both videos also had the other band riding in a pickup truck to and from the club. While some believed the tension between the two bands to be real, in reality the groups are close friends and devised the idea of a dual-video concept as a joke.
