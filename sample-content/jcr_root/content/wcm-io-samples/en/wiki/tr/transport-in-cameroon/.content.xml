== Railways ==
{{main|Rail transport in Cameroon}}

Railways in [[Cameroon]] are operated by [[Camrail]], a [[subsidiary]] of [[France|French]] investment group [[Bolloré]].  As of 2008, the country had an estimated 987&amp;amp;nbsp;km of {{RailGauge|1000}} [[Rail gauge|gauge]] track.
In 2007, the traffic on the line was estimated to be 1Mt per year freight, including 1 million passengers per year.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;autogenerated1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/37/2/36735844.pdf&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

There are no rail links with neighbouring countries.

== Roadways ==
[[Image:Yaounde buses.JPG|thumb|right|270px|Buses in [[Yaoundé]]]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Total highways:&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 50,000&amp;amp;nbsp;km
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Paved:&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 5,000&amp;amp;nbsp;km
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Unpaved:&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 45,000&amp;amp;nbsp;km (2004)

Cameroon lies at a key point in the [[Trans-African Highway network]], with three routes crossing its territory:
* [[Trans-Sahelian Highway|Dakar-N&amp;apos;Djamena Highway]], connecting just over the Cameroon border with the [[Ndjamena-Djibouti Highway|N&amp;apos;Djamena-Djibouti Highway]]
* [[Lagos-Mombasa Highway]]
* [[Tripoli-Cape Town Highway]]
Cameroon&amp;apos;s central location in the network means that efforts to close the gaps which exist in the network across Central Africa rely on the Cameroon&amp;apos;s participation in maintaining the network, and the network has the potential to have a profound influence on Cameroon&amp;apos;s regional trade. Except for the several relatively good toll roads which connect major cities (all of them one-lane) roads are poorly maintained and subject to inclement weather, since only 10% of the roadways are tarred. It is likely for instance that within a decade, a great deal of trade between West Africa and Southern Africa will be moving on the network through Yaoundé.

Prices of petrol rose steadily in 2007 and 2008, leading to a transport union strike in Douala on 25 February 2008. The strike quickly escalated into [[2008 Cameroonian anti-government protests|violent protests]] and spread to other major cities. The uprising finally subsided on 29 February.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Nkemngu, Martin A. (11 March 2008). &amp;quot;[http://www.cameroon-tribune.net/article.php?lang=Fr&amp;amp;oled=j11032008&amp;amp;idart=9281&amp;amp;olarch= Facts and Figures of the Tragic Protests]&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Cameroon Tribune]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Accessed 12 March 2008.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Waterways ==
2,090&amp;amp;nbsp;km; of decreasing importance.  Navigation mainly on the [[Benue]] river; limited during rainy season.

== Seaports and harbors ==
Of the operating maritime ports in Cameroon, [[Douala]] is the busiest and most important. Lesser ports include [[Kribi]], used chiefly for the export of [[wood]], and [[Limbe, Cameroon|Limbé]], used only for palm-oil exports. [[Garoua]], on the [[Benoué River]], is the main river port, but it is active only from July to September. In 2005, Cameroon’s merchant fleet consisted of one petroleum tanker, totalling 169,593 GRT.

* [[Douala]] - main port, railhead, and second largest city.
* [[Bonaberi]] - [[railhead]] to northwest
* [[Garoua]]
* [[Kribi]] - oil pipeline from [[Chad]]
** [[Kribi South]] - proposed iron ore export port, about 40&amp;amp;nbsp;km south of [[Kribi]].
* [[Tiko]]

==Pipelines==
889&amp;amp;nbsp;km of oil line (2008)

== Airports ==
The main international airport is the [[Douala International Airport]]. Secondary international airports are at [[Yaoundé]] and [[Garoua]]. In total, there were 34 airports in 2008, only 10 of which had paved runways. Among the international airlines serving Cameroon are Alitalia, Swiss, Iberia and [[Air Mali]].
