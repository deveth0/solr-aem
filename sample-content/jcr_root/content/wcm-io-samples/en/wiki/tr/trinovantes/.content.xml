The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Trinovantes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Trinobantes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were one of the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[tribe]]s of pre-[[Roman Britain]].  Their territory was on the north side of the [[Thames]] [[estuary]] in current [[Essex, England|Essex]] and [[Suffolk]], and included lands now located in [[Greater London]].  They were bordered to the north by the [[Iceni]], and to the west by the [[Catuvellauni]].  Their name derives from the Celtic intensive prefix &amp;quot;tri-&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;novio&amp;quot; - new, so meaning &amp;quot;very new&amp;quot; in the sense of &amp;quot;newcomers&amp;quot;, but possibly with an applied sense of vigorous or lively - so the name could mean &amp;quot;the very vigorous people&amp;quot;. Their capital was [[Camulodunum]] (modern [[Colchester]]), one proposed site of the legendary [[Camelot]].

Shortly before [[Julius Caesar]]&amp;apos;s [[Roman invasion of Britain|invasion of Britain]] in 55 and 54 BC, the Trinovantes were considered the most powerful tribe in Britain. At this time their capital was probably at [[Braughing]] (in modern-day [[Hertfordshire]]). In some manuscripts of Caesar&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Gallic War]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; their king is referred to as [[Imanuentius]], although in other manuscripts no name is given. Some time before Caesar&amp;apos;s second expedition this king was overthrown by [[Cassivellaunus]], who is usually assumed to have belonged to the [[Catuvellauni]]. His son, [[Mandubracius]], fled to the protection of Caesar in [[Gaul]]. During his second expedition Caesar defeated Cassivellaunus and restored Mandubracius to the kingship, and Cassivellaunus undertook not to molest him again. [[Tribute]] was also agreed.

The next identifiable king of the Trinovantes, known from [[numismatic]] evidence, was [[Addedomarus]], who took power c. 20-15 BC, and moved the tribe&amp;apos;s capital to Camulodunum. For a brief period c. 10 BC [[Tasciovanus]] of the Catuvellauni issued coins from Camulodunum, suggesting that he conquered the Trinovantes, but he was soon forced to withdraw, perhaps as a result of pressure from the Romans, as his later coins no longer bear the mark &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rex&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;, and Addedomarus was restored.  Addedomarus was briefly succeeded by his son [[Dubnovellaunus]] c. 10&amp;amp;ndash;5 BC, but a few years later the tribe was finally conquered by either Tasciovanus or his son [[Cunobelinus]]. Mandubracius, Addedomarus and Dubnovellaunus all appear in later, post-Roman and medieval British Celtic genealogies and legends as Manawydan, Aedd Mawr (Addedo the Great) and Dyfnwal Moelmut (Dubnovellaunus the Bald and Silent). The [[Welsh Triads]] recall Aedd Mawr as one of the founders of Britain.

The Trinovantes reappeared in history when they participated in [[Boudica]]&amp;apos;s revolt against the [[Roman Empire]] in 60 AD. Their name was given to one of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;civitates&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of [[Roman Britain]], whose chief town was Caesaromagus (modern [[Chelmsford]], Essex). The style of their rich burials (see [[facies]] of [[Aylesford]]) is of continental origin and evidence of their affiliation to the [[Belgae|Belgic]] people.
Their name was re-used as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Trinovantum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the supposed original name of [[London]], by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his fictitious &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in which he claimed the name derived from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Troi-novantum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;quot;New [[Troy]]&amp;quot;, connecting this with the legend that Britain was founded by [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]] and other refugees from the [[Trojan War]].

==Popular culture==
In [[Chelmsford 123]], a British television [[situation comedy]] produced for [[Channel 4]] by [[Hat Trick Productions]], the main character of Badvoc (played by [[Rory McGrath]]) was the leader of The Trinovantes.
