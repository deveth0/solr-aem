&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Trentham&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the most populous suburb of [[Upper Hutt]], a city in the [[Wellington]] region of [[New Zealand]]. The suburb is located in a widening of the [[Hutt Valley]], five kilometres to the southwest of the Upper Hutt city centre.

The name &amp;quot;Trentham&amp;quot; was initially given by [[Richard Barton]], the first European Settler in the area, in honour of his former employer, the [[Duke of Sutherland]]. One of the Duke of Sutherland&amp;apos;s subsidiary titles was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscount Trentham&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Trentham in the County of Stafford.

Due to the New Zealand tendency towards [[spelling pronunciation|spelling pronunciations]], the name is invariably pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|ɛ|n|.|θ|əm|&amp;apos;}}, rather than the traditional English pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|ɛ|n|t|.|h|əm}}.

The suburb is home to the [[Trentham Racecourse]], the base of the [[Wellington Racing Club]] (WRC), the site of [[Hutt International Boys&amp;apos; School]] and is also the site of the [[Trentham Military Camp]], which was used extensively for training soldiers in preparation for [[World War I]] and is still a base for the [[NZ Army]] and Defence Force.

[[Barton&amp;apos;s Bush]] is located in Trentham.
