&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are a [[grassland]] terrestrial [[biome]] located in [[semi-arid]] to semi-[[humid]] [[climate]] regions of [[subtropical]] and [[tropical]] [[latitudes]].

==Description==
[[Grassland]]s are dominated by [[grass]] and other [[herb]]aceous plants. [[Savanna]]s are grasslands with scattered [[tree]]s. [[Shrubland]]s are dominated by woody or herbaceous [[shrub]]s.

Rainfall in tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands is between 500 and 1300 millimeters (20 to 50&amp;amp;nbsp;inches) a year,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book

==Occurrence==
Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands occur on all continents but Antarctica. They are widespread in [[Africa]], and are also found all throughout [[South Asia]], the northern parts of [[South America]] and [[Australia]], and the southern [[United States]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;African Savannas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; occur between forest or woodland regions and grassland regions. The climate varies, with an average temperature of 27 °C with peaks of 30 °C in April and October, and between 300 and 1500 millimetres of rain per year. Flora includes:
*[[Acacia]] (Tree)
**Loses leaves in dry season to conserve moisture
**Leafy canopy in rainy season (flattened by winds)
*[[Baobab]] (Tree)
**Stores water in trunk
**Thick bark to protect it from fires in dry season
**Long tap roots to reach underground moisture
**Few leaves to reduce water loss through transpiration
*[[Grass]]
**Grow quickly to 3 or 4 meters in clumps
**Shoots die in dry season leaving only roots
*Low shrubs
**Drought resistant
**Small
**Thorns not leaves
