The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Efficeon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; processor is [[Transmeta]]&amp;apos;s second-generation [[256-bit]] [[Very long instruction word|VLIW]] design which employs a software engine to convert code written for [[x86]] processors to the native [[instruction set]] of the chip (Code Morphing Software, aka CMS). Like its predecessor, the [[Transmeta Crusoe]] (a [[128-bit]] VLIW architecture), Efficeon stresses computational efficiency, low power consumption, and a low thermal footprint.

Efficeon most closely mirrors the feature set of [[Intel]] [[Pentium 4]] processors, although, like [[AMD]] [[Opteron]] processors, it supports a fully integrated [[memory controller]], a [[HyperTransport]] IO bus, and the [[NX bit]], or no-execute [[x86]] extension to [[Physical Address Extension|PAE mode]].  [[NX bit]] support is available starting with CMS version 6.0.4.

Efficeon&amp;apos;s computational performance relative to mobile CPUs like the [[Intel]] [[Pentium M]] is thought to be lower, although little appears to be published about the relative performance of these competing processors.

Efficeon comes in two [[Chip carrier|package]] types: a 783- and a 592-contact [[ball grid array]]. Its power consumption is moderate (with some consuming as little as 3 watts at 1 GHz and 7 watts at 1.5 GHz), so it can be passively cooled.

Two generations of this chip were produced. The first generation (TM8600) was manufactured using a [[TSMC]] 0.13 micrometre process and produced at speeds up to 1.2 [[GHz]]. The second generation (TM8800 and TM8820) was manufactured using a [[Fujitsu]] 90&amp;amp;nbsp;nm process and produced at speeds ranging from 1 GHz to 1.7 GHz.

Internally, the Efficeon has two [[arithmetic logic unit]]s, two load/store/add units, two execute units, two [[floating-point]]/[[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]]/[[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]]/[[SSE2]] units, one [[branch prediction]] unit, one alias unit, and one control unit. The VLIW core can execute a 256-bit VLIW instruction per cycle, which is called a molecule and has room to store eight 32-bit instructions (called atoms) per cycle.

The Efficeon has a 128 KB L1 instruction cache, a 64 KB L1 data cache and a 1 MB L2 cache. All caches are on die.

Additionally the Efficeon CMS (code morphing software) reserves a small portion of main memory (typically 32 MB) for its translation cache of dynamically translated x86 instructions.
