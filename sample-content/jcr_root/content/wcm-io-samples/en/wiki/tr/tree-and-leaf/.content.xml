&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tree and Leaf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small book published in 1964, containing two works by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]:
* a revised version of an essay called &amp;quot;[[On Fairy-Stories]]&amp;quot; (originally published in 1947 in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Essays Presented to Charles Williams&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)
* an allegorical short story called &amp;quot;[[Leaf by Niggle]]&amp;quot; (originally published in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dublin Review (Catholic periodical)|Dublin Review]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1945).

The book was originally illustrated by [[Pauline Baynes]].

&amp;quot;[[Mythopoeia (poem)|Mythopoeia]]&amp;quot; was added to the 1988 edition (ISBN 0395502322). Later versions also include &amp;quot;[[The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm&amp;apos;s Son]]&amp;quot;.

Both pieces were re-issued in the collection &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Tolkien Reader]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1966), and have also appeared in various subsequent collections.
