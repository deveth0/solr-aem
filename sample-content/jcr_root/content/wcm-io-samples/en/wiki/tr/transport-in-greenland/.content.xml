The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[transportation system]] in [[Greenland]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is very unusual in that Greenland has no [[railway]]s, no [[inland waterway]]s, and virtually no roads between towns. There are 150&amp;amp;nbsp;km (90&amp;amp;nbsp;mi) of roads in the whole country; 60&amp;amp;nbsp;km (40&amp;amp;nbsp;mi) of the roads are paved. Two towns are connected by a 4.5&amp;amp;nbsp;km road, [[Ivittuut]] and [[Kangilinnguit]]; the rest are isolated. Historically the major means of transportation has been by boat around the coast in summer and by [[dog sled]] in winter, particularly in the north and east.

==Air transport==
While [[Germany]] occupied [[Denmark]] during [[World War&amp;amp;nbsp;II]], the [[United States]] controlled Greenland and built [[airport]]s there. The airports were codenamed [[Bluie West One]] through to [[Bluie West Eight]] on the west of the island and Bluie East One to Bluie East Four on the eastern side. The largest of those airports, [[Bluie West Eight]], now renamed [[Kangerlussuaq Airport]], remains the international hub for travel to Greenland, as it is the only airport that has a large enough runway to service [[jumbo jet]]s. American authorities at one time entertained the idea of building a road from Kangerlussuaq to the second-largest airport, in Narsarsuaq, several hundred kilometres to the south. The idea was abandoned after feasibility studies failed to prove it was possible.

Greenland now has 18 airstrips, 14 of which are paved. All domestic flights are operated by [[Air Greenland]]. The name was [[anglicisation|anglicized]] in 2002 from the [[Danish language|Danish]] Grønlandsfly ([[Greenlandair]] in English). International flights are limited to four weekly flights from [[Copenhagen]] to Kangerlussuaq, and to Reykjavik, Iceland.

[[Air Iceland]] flies from [[Reykjavík]] to Narsarsuaq. It offers also &amp;quot;day trips to the wilderness&amp;quot; from Reykjavík to [[Kulusuk]] on the east coast. Air Iceland flies to [[Ittoqqortoormiit]] over [[Kulusuk]] once or twice a week throughout the year. Flights from Reykjavik are flown throughout the year. Also, year-round flights from Reykjavik to [[Ilulissat]] will be offered after April 2011. From 2012 Air Greenland operates a route from [[Iqaluit]] in Canada to Nuuk during summer.

==Other==
There are ports at [[Ilulissat]], [[Kangerlussuaq]] (also known by its Danish name Søndre Strømfjord), [[Qaqortoq]], [[Narsaq]], [[Nuuk]] (Godthåb), [[Aasiaat]] and [[Sisimiut]]. Several other towns have also small ports. The only two users of the harbors are [[Royal Arctic Line]] and [[Arctic Umiaq Line]].

Historically, special-purpose [[narrow gauge railway]]s, such as that in the village of [[Qoornoq]] in the [[Nuuk]] [[fjord]], have operated. The Qoornoq railway was used for transporting fish from the harbour to scaffolds for drying.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;NQ&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://okj.malmborg.info/travelreports/Qoornoq_X-press/Qoornoq_X-press.htm|title=Narrow gauge railway on Greenland|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The railway was abandoned shortly before the village.
