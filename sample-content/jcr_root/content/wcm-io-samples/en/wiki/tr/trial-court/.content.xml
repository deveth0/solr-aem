A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;trial court&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;court of first instance&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[court]] in which [[trial]]s take place. Such courts are said to have [[original jurisdiction]].

== In the United States ==

A trial court of [[general jurisdiction]] is authorized to hear any type of         [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[Legal case|case]] that is not committed exclusively to another court. In the [[United States]], the [[United States district court]]s are the trial courts of general jurisdiction of the [[United States federal courts|federal judiciary]]; each [[U.S. state]] has a [[State court (United States)|state court]] system establishing trial courts of general jurisdiction, such as the [[Florida Circuit Courts]] in [[Florida]], the [[Superior Courts of California]] in [[California]], and the [[New York Supreme Court]] in [[New York]].

Not all cases are heard in trial courts of general jurisdiction. A trial court of [[limited jurisdiction]] is authorized to hear only specified types of cases. Trial courts of limited jurisdiction may be limited in [[subject-matter jurisdiction]] (such as [[Juvenile court|juvenile]], [[probate]], and [[family court]]s in many U.S. states, or the [[United States Tax Court]] in the federal judiciary) or by other means, such as [[small claims court]]s in many states for civil cases with a low [[amount in controversy]]. Other trials do not take place in courts at all, but in [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial bodies]] or in [[administrative agencies]] with [[Adjudication|adjudicatory]] power created by [[statute]] to make binding determinations with simplified procedural practices, such as [[arbitration]].

Because different U.S. states apply different names to their courts, it is often not evident whether a court has general or limited [[jurisdiction]]. For instance, the Maine District Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, but the [[Nevada District Courts]] are courts of general jurisdiction.

In the trial court, [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] and [[testimony]] are admitted under the [[rules of evidence]] established by applicable [[procedural law]] and determinations called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;findings of fact&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are made based on the evidence. The court, presided over by one or more [[judge]]s, makes &amp;apos;&amp;apos;findings of law&amp;apos;&amp;apos; based upon the applicable law. In most [[common law]] jurisdictions, the trial court often sits with a [[jury]] and one [[judge]]; in such [[jury trial]]s, the jury acting as [[trier of fact]]. In some cases, the judge or judges act as triers of both fact and law, by either statute, custom, or agreement of the parties; this is referred to as a [[bench trial]]s.  In the case of most judges hearing cases through the [[bench trial]] process, they would prefer that all parties are given an opportunity to offer a vigorous and robust case presentation, such that, errors in [[testimony]], procedures, statutes, etc., do not grow &amp;quot;crab legs&amp;quot; -- meaning compounded errors -- and are [[remanded]] or returned to their court on [[appeal]].

[[Appeal]]s from the decisions of trial courts are usually made by higher courts with the power of appellate review ([[appellate court]]s). Most trial courts are [[Court of record|courts of record]], where the record of the presentation of evidence is created and must be maintained or transmitted to the appellate court. The record of the trial court is certified by the [[Court clerk|clerk of the trial court]] and transmitted to the appellate body. Most appellate courts do not have the authority to hear testimony or take evidence, but instead rule solely on matters of law.
