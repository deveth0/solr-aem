&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Transformative justice&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a general philosophical strategy for responding to conflicts. It takes the principles and practices of [[restorative justice]] beyond the criminal [[justice]] system. It applies to areas such as [[environmental law]], [[corporate law]], [[Labor relations|labor-management relations]], consumer [[bankruptcy]] and debt, and [[family law]]. Transformative justice uses a [[Systems theory|systems approach]], seeking to see problems, as not only the beginning of the crime but also the causes of crime, and tries to treat an offense as a transformative relational and educational opportunity for victims, offenders and all other members of the affected community.  In theory, a transformative justice model can apply even between peoples with no prior contact.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
