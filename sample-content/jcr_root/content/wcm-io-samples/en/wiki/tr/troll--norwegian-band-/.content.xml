&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Troll&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[symphonic black metal]] band.

==Biography==
It was founded in 1992, when 14-year-old [[Stian Arnesen]] aka &amp;quot;Nagash&amp;quot; started writing music with Glaurung and Fafnir. When Glaurung and Fafnir left the project, Nagash continued Troll as a solo project and released &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Trollstorm over Nidingjuv&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1995 and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Drep de kristne&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1996.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://twistednews.org/news2/?p=23&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Following the release of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Drep de kristne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Nagash spent more time working with other bands such as [[Dimmu Borgir]] and his other band [[The Kovenant|Covenant]] that he started with Blackheart. Troll was inactive until 2000. By that time Fafnir, now under the name Sinister Minister Twice, had rejoined Troll. Other members were also added, making Troll a group and no longer a solo project. With Nagash concentrating on guitar and synth, Troll released &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Last Predators&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 2000 and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Universal&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 2001.

Significant progress took place between &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Drep de kristne&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Last Predators&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Lyrical content was now mainly English, and the imagery revolved less around [[Satanism|Satanic]] symbols and hate for Christians. The music became less [[wiktionary:grim|grim]] and more [[symphonic metal|symphonic]] over the years.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.metalmaniacs.com/2010/troll-consuming-for-higher-means/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 2007 Nagash had assembled a full line-up for Troll, and began recording a new album in January 2009. That album, Neo-Satanic Supremacy, was released in early 2010, and described by one critic as &amp;quot;An entertaining, if somewhat over-familiar slice of 90s-style symphonic black metal&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;test&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.onemetal.com/2010/01/25/troll-neo-satanic-supremacy OneMetal.com review], by Philip Whitehouse.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
