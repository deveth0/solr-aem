&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pyromancy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (from [[Greek language|Greek]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;pyros,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; “fire,” and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;manteia,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; “divination”) is the art of [[divination]] by means of [[fire]].

==History of pyromancy==
Due to the importance of fire in society from the earliest of times, it is quite likely that pyromancy was one of the earlier forms of divination.  It is said that in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] society, [[virgin]]s at the [[Parthenon|Temple of Athena]] in [[Athens]] regularly practiced pyromancy. It is also possible that followers of [[Hephaestus]], the Greek god of fire and the [[forge]], practiced pyromancy.

In [[Renaissance magic]], pyromancy was classified as one of the seven &amp;quot;forbidden arts,&amp;quot; along with [[necromancy]], [[geomancy]], [[aeromancy]], [[hydromancy]], chiromancy ([[palmistry]]), and spatulamancy ([[scapulimancy]]).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Johannes Hartlieb]] (Munich, 1456) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Book of All Forbidden Arts&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; quoted in Láng, p. 124.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Types of pyromancy==
The most basic form of pyromancy is that in which the diviner observes flames, from a sacrificial fire, a candle, or another source of flame, and interprets the shapes that he or she sees within them.  There are several variations on pyromancy, however, some of which are as follows:
*[[Alomancy]], divination by salt, one type of which involves casting salt into a fire
*[[Botanomancy]], divination by burning plants
*[[Capnomancy]], divination by smoke; light, thin smoke that rose straight up was a good omen; otherwise, a bad one.
*Causinomancy, divination by burning (non-specific as to the object burned)
*[[Daphnomancy]] (also, Empyromancy), divination by burning laurel leaves
*Osteomancy, divination using bones, one type of which involves heating to produce cracks
*[[Plastromancy]], divination using turtle [[plastron]]s; in China, this was done by heating pits carved into them.
*[[Scapulimancy]], divination by scapulae; in Asia and North America, this was done pyromantically.
*Sideromancy, divination by burning straw with an [[Ironing|iron]] (Greek:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sideros&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)

==Pyromancy in fiction==
In fiction, &amp;quot;pyromancy&amp;quot; is often a [[malapropism]] for [[pyrokinesis]], which is usually used for combat, not divination.
* Computer games such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Guild Wars]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Heroes of Might and Magic]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Titan Quest]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wizard101]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dark Souls]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[World of Warcraft]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; use pyromancy as a name for fire-related magic.
* In the anime and manga &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sailor Moon]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Sailor Mars]] practices pyromancy by searching for visions in a roaring fire.
* In the series of fantasy novels [[A Song of Ice and Fire]] a character Melisandre performs pyromancy to show another character his future, but there is also a &amp;quot;pyromancer&amp;quot; who does not perform pyromancy, but is educated in the science of fire and flammable substances.
* In The [[Guardians of Ga&amp;apos;Hoole]] series, very few characters possesses this ability. It goes by the name &amp;quot;fire sight&amp;quot;.
