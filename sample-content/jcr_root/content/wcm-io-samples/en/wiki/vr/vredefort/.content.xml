&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vredefort&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small farming town in the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] province of [[South Africa]] with [[cattle]], [[peanut]]s, [[sorghum]], [[sunflowers]] and [[maize]] being farmed.  It is home to 3,000 residents.

The town was established in 1876 on a farm called Visgat, on the [[Vredefort crater]], the largest and oldest visible [[bolide]] [[impact crater]] in the world (with a diameter of {{convert|300|km|mi}}). It was this approximately {{convert|10|km|mi|adj=on}} wide bolide that led to the preservation of the [[gold]]-bearing reefs of the Free State some 2.02 billion years ago. The town got its name after the peaceful conclusion of a threatened war between the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] and the [[Orange Free State]]. The British built a [[concentration camp]] here during the [[Second Boer War]] to house [[Boer]] women and children.

The Vredefort Dome (Crater) is currently the largest and one of the oldest known meteor impact site in the world.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/CIDiameterSort2.htm Earth Impact Database]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is South Africa&amp;apos;s seventh World Heritage Site and its status is largely due to the efforts of research scientists from Wits University, including Dr. Rodger Hart{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}.
