A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;rubidium standard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;rubidium atomic clock&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[frequency standard]] in which a specified [[hyperfine level|hyperfine]] transition of [[electron]]s in [[rubidium]]-87 atoms is used to control the output frequency. It is the most inexpensive, compact, and widely used type of [[atomic clock]], used to control the frequency of [[television station]]s, [[cellular base station|cell phone base stations]], in test equipment, and [[global navigation satellite system]]s like [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]. Commercial rubidium clocks are less accurate than [[Cesium clock|cesium atomic clock]]s which serve as [[Primary standard|primary frequency standards]], so the rubidium clock is a [[secondary frequency standard]]. However, rubidium fountains are currently being developed that are even more stable than caesium fountain clocks.

All commercial rubidium frequency standards operate by disciplining a [[crystal oscillator]] to the rubidium hyperfine transition of 6&amp;amp;nbsp;834&amp;amp;nbsp;682&amp;amp;nbsp;610.904&amp;amp;nbsp;324&amp;amp;nbsp;Hz. The amount of light from a rubidium [[discharge lamp]] that reaches a [[photodetector]] through a resonance cell will drop by about 0.1% when the rubidium vapor in the resonance cell is exposed to [[microwave]] power near the [[transition frequency]]. The crystal oscillator is stabilized to the rubidium transition by detecting the light dip while sweeping an [[Radio frequency|RF]] [[frequency synthesizer|synthesizer]] (referenced to the crystal) through the transition frequency.
