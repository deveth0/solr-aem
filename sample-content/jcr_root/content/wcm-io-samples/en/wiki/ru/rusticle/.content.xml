[[File:Detached_rusticles_hires.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Detached rusticles below port side anchor of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Titanic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]].]]
A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;rusticle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a formation of [[rust]] similar to an [[icicle]] or [[stalactite]] in appearance that occurs underwater when [[wrought iron]] [[oxidation|oxidizes]].  They may be familiar from underwater photographs of [[shipwreck]]s, such as the [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|RMS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Titanic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] and the [[German battleship Bismarck#Wreckage|German battleship &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bismarck&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]].  Rusticles are created by microbes that consume iron.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|last=Cullimore|first=Dr. Roy|title=Rusticles Thrive on the Titanic|url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/03titanic/rusticles/rusticles.html|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|coauthors=Lori Johnston|Revised February 27, 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;rusticle&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[portmanteau]] of the words &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[rust]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[icicle]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and was coined by [[Robert Ballard]], who first observed them on the wreck of the [[RMS Titanic|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Titanic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] in 1986.&amp;lt;ref name=Bacteria&amp;gt;{{cite news |title=New species of bacteria found in Titanic &amp;apos;rusticles&amp;apos; |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11926932 |newspaper=BBC News |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=1 March 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Rusticles on the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Titanic&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were the first investigated in 1996 by Roy Cullimore, based at the [[University of Regina]] in [[Canada]]. Recently, a brand-new species of bacteria living inside the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Titanic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s rusticles called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Halomonas titanicae]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was discovered in 2010, and it is the bacteria that is responsible for all the rusticle growth on the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Titanic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Rusticles can form on any submerged steel object and have been seen on other subsea structures such as mooring chains&amp;lt;ref name=chain /&amp;gt; and subsea equipment.  They form more rapidly in warmer climates and can form in water with little to no [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;chain&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.intermoor.com/information-center-23/technical-articles-26/omae-2012-84067-microbiologically-influenced-corrosion-of-gulf-of-mexico-mooring-chain-at-6-000-feet-depths-317 Microbiologically influenced corrosion of Gulf of Mexico mooring chain at 6,000 feet depths]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Composition==
The rusticle consists of up to 35% [[iron]] compounds including [[iron oxide]]s, iron [[carbonate]]s and iron [[hydroxide]]s.  The remainder of the structure is actually a complex community of [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] or [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] [[microbe]]s including [[bacteria]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Halomonas titanicae]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref name=Bacteria/&amp;gt; and [[fungi]] that use the rusting [[metal]] as a source of [[food]], causing [[microbial corrosion]] and collectively producing the mineral compounds as waste products and hence forming the rusticle.

Since rusticles are found on wrought iron rather than other [[ferrous]] metals, it is supposed that the microbes also use the [[sulfur]] and [[phosphorus]] impurities found in the metal.

==Structure==
Structurally, rusticles contain channels to allow water to flow through, and they seem to be built up in a ring structure similar to the growth rings of a [[tree]].  They are very delicate and can easily disintegrate into fine powder on even the slightest touch.

==Colors==
The outer surface of a rusticle is smooth [[red]] in appearance from the [[iron (III) oxide]], while the core is bright [[Orange (colour)|orange]] due to the presence of crystals of [[goethite]] (a hydrated iron oxide).
