        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rubbery Figures&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a satirical rubber puppet series that screened in [[Australia]] in various forms from 1984 to 1990. It appeared on TV comedies like &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|The ABC&amp;apos;s Rubbery Figures]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Fast Forward (TV series)|Fast Forward]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It featured puppets of major political and social characters.

== Production ==

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rubbery Figures&amp;apos;&amp;apos; programs were made in the [[Melbourne]] film studio of [[Peter Nicholson (cartoonist)|Peter Nicholson]], who also made the puppets themselves. Almost all the character voices for the puppets were performed by Melbourne voice actor [[Paul Jennings (voice over artist)|Paul Jennings]]. The programs featured inserts of animation of puppet photo cutouts done mainly by Michael Nicholson,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.mikenicholson.com/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; in a manner reminiscent of [[Terry Gilliam|Terry Gilliam&amp;apos;s]] work on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Monty Python&amp;apos;s Flying Circus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

== Fast Forward&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rubbery Figures&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ==

Fast Forward included &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rubbery Figures&amp;apos;&amp;apos; during its 1980s run, lasting until 1990. It was during its appearance on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fast Forward&amp;apos;&amp;apos; that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rubbery Figures&amp;apos;&amp;apos; acquired so many of its characters.

=== Characters ===
==== Australian politicians ====

Like shows such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Spitting Image]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hurra Deutschland]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the primary characters of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rubbery Figures&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were politicians native to the program&amp;apos;s country (i.e. [[Australia]]). The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rubbery Figures&amp;apos;&amp;apos; political characters included:

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bob Hawke]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - portrayed as a self-centred, power-hungry opportunist

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Paul Keating]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - who appeared on the show as Hawke&amp;apos;s down-to-earth crony

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Andrew Peacock]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - John Howard&amp;apos;s main competition for Liberal Party chief. Presented (not without some basis) as vain and snobbish

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[John Howard]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - presented as an irritating, nerdy loser

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[John Elliott (businessman)|John Elliott]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - who appeared as a literally big-nosed, foul-mouthed drunkard

==== International politicians ====

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rubbery Figures&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also satirised prominent world politicians of the time, among them were:

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Margaret Thatcher]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - the then-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], who appeared as an eccentric profiteer eager to appeal to the Australian government

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ronald Reagan]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - the then-[[President of the United States]], who appeared as a lumberjack intent on keeping his nuclear weapons program a secret

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Mikhail Gorbachev]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - former [[Premier of the Soviet Union]], who was portrayed as an easygoing liberal who was always giving himself time off

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - the ruler of [[Libya]], whose puppet was permanently impaled by a missile with the letters &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;[[United States|USA]]&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; painted on one side

== Music ==

In 1991, EMI Music released a RUBBERY FIGURES music track called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;The Recession Rap&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It hit #60 on the ARIA Chart in August 1991.

The music &amp;amp; lyrics to &amp;quot;The Recession Rap&amp;quot; were written by David Atkin, Peter Benson &amp;amp; Troy Hazard and the music was produced by David Atkin &amp;amp; Peter Benson for Keynote Audio Productions.
