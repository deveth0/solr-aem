&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rubab Raza&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|رُباب رضا}}}}; born January 15, 1991&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ra/rubab-raza-1.html Raza&amp;apos;s entry] from sports-reference.com; retrieved 2011-01-24.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) is an Olympic and [[List of Pakistani records in swimming|national-record]]-holding swimmer from [[Pakistan]]. She became Pakistan&amp;apos;s first female Olympic swimmer when she swam at the [[Pakistan at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympics]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3812839.stm Pakistan girl gets Olympic dream], published by the [[BBC]] on 2004-06-16; retrieved 2011-01-24.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3582788.stm Pakistan girl makes Olympic history], published by the [[BBC]] on 2004-08-20; retrieved 2011-01-24.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

At the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], she swam the [[Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Women&amp;apos;s 50 metre freestyle|50m Freestyle]], though unable to progress through the first round she undoubtedly opened up the opportunity for future female Pakistani swimmers. She became the second Pakistani female to compete at the Olympics—following [[Shabana Akhtar]] at the [[Pakistan at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]]--shortly before the country&amp;apos;s third female competitor, [[Sumaira Zahoor]], who ran the 1500m at the 2004 Games a few days after Raza swam. At the age of 13 at the time of her Olympic race, Raza was the youngest Pakistani female ever to compete at an Olympics.

The Pakistani Swimming Federation funded her with only $30 a month, but she was fortunate to have support from her father who is a retired [[army]] [[major]] and her mother who is a [[Physician|doctor]].

She has won a number of national titles, and has seen success at Asian swimming tournaments.

She has also swum for Pakistan at the:
*[[2006 South Asian Games]]
*[[Aquatics at the 2006 Commonwealth Games|2006 Commonwealth Games]]
