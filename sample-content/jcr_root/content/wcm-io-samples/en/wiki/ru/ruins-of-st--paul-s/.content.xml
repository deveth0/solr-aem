[[File:Ruins Of St Paul&amp;apos;s Cathedral, Macau.jpg|thumb|Ruins Of Saint Paul&amp;apos;s Cathedral]]
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ruins of St. Paul&amp;apos;s&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-pt|Ruínas de São Paulo}}, {{zh|c=大三巴牌坊|p=Dàsānbā Páifāng}}) refers to the ruins of a 16th-century complex in [[Macau]] including of what was originally [[St. Paul&amp;apos;s College, Macao|St. Paul&amp;apos;s College]] and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cathedral of St. Paul&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also known as &amp;quot;[[Theotokos|Mater Dei]]&amp;quot;, a 17th-century Portuguese cathedral dedicated to [[Saint Paul]] the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]]. Today, the ruins are one of Macau&amp;apos;s most famous landmarks. In 2005, they were officially enlisted as part of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] [[Historic Centre of Macau]].

==History==
[[File:Jesuit Convent, Macao.jpg|thumb|The facade of St. Paul&amp;apos;s Cathedral by [[Wilhelm Heine]], 1854]]
Built from 1582 to 1602 by the [[Jesuit]]s, the cathedral was one of the largest [[Catholic]] churches in Asia at the time, and the royalty of Europe vied with each other to bestow upon the cathedral the best gifts. With the decline in importance of Macau, which was overtaken as the main port for the [[Pearl River Delta]] by [[Hong Kong]], the cathedral&amp;apos;s fortunes similarly ebbed, and it was destroyed by a fire during a typhoon in 1835. The [[Fortaleza do Monte]] overlooks the ruin.

==Features==

The ruins now consist of the southern stone façade—intricately carved between 1620 and 1627 by Japanese Christians in exile from their homeland and local craftsmen under the direction of Italian Jesuit [[Carlo Spinola]]—and the [[crypt]]s of the Jesuits who established and maintained the Cathedral. The façade sits on a small hill, with 66 stone steps leading up to it. The carvings include Jesuit images with Oriental themes, such as a woman stepping on a seven-headed [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]], described by [[Chinese character]]s as &amp;apos; Holy Mother tramples the heads of the dragon&amp;apos;. A few of the other carvings are the founders of the Jesuit Order, the conquest of Death by [[Jesus]], and at the very top, a dove with wings outstretched.

==Conservation==
Resisting calls for the dangerously leaning structure to be demolished, from 1990 to 1995 the ruins were [[excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] under the auspices of the [[Instituto Cultural de Macau]] to study its historic past. The crypt and the foundations were uncovered, revealing the architectural plan of the building. Numerous religious artifacts were also found together with the relics of the Japanese Christian [[martyr]]s and the monastic clergy, including the founder of the [[St. Paul Jesuit College (Macau)|Jesuit college in Macau]], Father [[Alessandro Valignano]]. The ruins were restored by the Macanese government into a [[museum]], and the facade is now buttressed with concrete and steel in a way which preserves the aesthetic integrity of the facade. A steel stairway allows tourists to climb up to the top of the facade from the rear. It is customary to throw coins into the top window of the ruins from the stairs, for luck.
