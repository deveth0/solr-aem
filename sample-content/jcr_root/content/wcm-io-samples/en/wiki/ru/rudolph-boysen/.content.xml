        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Charles Rudolph Boysen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (July 14, 1895 – November 25, 1950) was the California [[horticulturist]] who created the [[boysenberry]], a hybrid between several varieties of [[blackberry|blackberries]], [[raspberry|raspberries]], and [[loganberry|loganberries]].

==Boysenberry==

Rudolph Boysen experimented with various berry crosses in [[Napa, California]] in the 1920s. In 1923, his hybrid successfully grew and bore fruit. However, unable to make his new berry a commercial success, Boysen abandoned his crop after breaking his back in an accident. When Boysen moved to Orange County, he brought with him what was described by the consulted Coolidge Rare Plant Nursery of Altedena as &amp;quot;the sensation berry of the 20th Century.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Boysenberry Creator&amp;apos;s Juicy Details&amp;quot;, [[Orange Coast Magazine]], Nov 2006, pp 208-12 http://books.google.com/books?id=owYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA210&amp;amp;lpg=PA210&amp;amp;dq=Coolidge+%22sensation+berry%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=l5PkseupxD&amp;amp;sig=NH-UKb-A7GtqziumRbmiESD_2os&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=8tAMT46PO6nn0QGht-GEBg&amp;amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Coolidge%20%22sensation%20berry%22&amp;amp;f=false&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Years later, a fellow grower named Walter Knott heard about the berry and tracked down Boysen. [[Walter Knott]] was able to bring a few dying vines back to life at his farm, now known as [[Knott&amp;apos;s Berry Farm]] in [[Buena Park, California]]. Knott named the fruit after Boysen.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;“Oregon Raspberry and Blackberry Commission http://www.oregon-berries.com/boysenberry.cfm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Legacy==

There&amp;apos;s a Boysenberry Lane in [[Placentia, California]]  and a Boysen Avenue in [[Anaheim, California]], both named for Rudolph Boysen. Boysen Park, a {{convert|24|acre|m2|sing=on}} public park in Anaheim was named in his honor. It features playgrounds, baseball diamonds, a large lawn, and a stucco-coated, Korean War-vintage Navy jet as a children&amp;apos;s climbing toy.  The Anaheim Tennis Center is located adjacent to Boysen Park, located at 951 S. State College Blvd. Rudolph Boysen died at the age of 55, and is interred at the Melrose Abbey Cemetery in Anaheim.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;NNBD Tracking the Entire World  http://www.nndb.com/people/125/000124750/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Orange County Register.
