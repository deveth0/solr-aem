&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rudy Trouvé&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 28 January 1967 in [[Wilrijk]]) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[music]]ian from [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]].
In the early nineties he founded the [[Heavenhotel]] [[record label]] and released dozens of records since. Between 1993 and 1995 he was part of [[Deus (band)|Deus]], quitting the band in favour of focusing on his own solo career, exploring obscure music groups and temporary [[collaboration]]s.

Since 1995, he scored most success with [[Kiss My Jazz]] and [[Dead Man Ray]], and recorded a split album with [[Lou Barlow]] on the [[Sub Rosa]] label.

Rudy Trouvé is regarded highly as an improvisor; in jam sessions and experimental concerts he has shared the stage with [[Mauro Pawlowski]], [[Zeitkratzer Ensemble]] ([[Germany]]), [[Marc Ribot]] ([[USA]]), [[Pierre Bastien]], [[Pierre Berthet]], members of [[DAAU]], [[Zita Swoon]],...

As a former student at St-Lukas in [[Ghent]], Rudy Trouvé is also famous for his artwork; figurative paintings and blow-ups which can be found on the record sleeves of most of his self-produced records.
