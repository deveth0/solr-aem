        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ruisrock&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[rock festival]] held annually on the island of [[Ruissalo]] in [[Turku]], [[Finland]].
Ruisrock, founded in 1970, is the second oldest rock festival in Europe&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.ruisrock.fi/en/info&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and the oldest in Finland. The festival has attracted world-famous artists throughout its lifetime except around the start of the 2000s (decade), due to the organizer&amp;apos;s economic issues. There are plans to expand the festival area, from the five stages currently present.

The festival area is divided into two sections, Niittyalue (&amp;quot;meadow section&amp;quot;) and Ranta-alue (&amp;quot;beach section&amp;quot;).

In 2005, when the German [[industrial metal]] band [[Rammstein]] performed at the festival, 71,000 visitors attended the festival. In recent years, the number of visitors has fluctuated around 70,000. However, the all-time record was set in 1971, when there were about 100,000 visitors, with artists such as [[Canned Heat]] playing.

The 2009 edition of the festival saw a rise in attendance, when during 3 days there was a total of 92,000 visitors. In 2009, musical acts such as [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]], [[Faith No More]], [[Mew (band)|Mew]], [[In Flames]], [[Volbeat]], [[Glasvegas]], [[The Sounds]], [[D&amp;apos;espairsRay]], and popular domestic artists including [[Children of Bodom]], [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]], [[Eppu Normaali]], [[Tehosekoitin]] played at the festival, including the last live performance by [[The Crash (band)|The Crash]].

In 2010, the festival was celebrating its 40-year anniversary, with popular artists such as [[Slash (guitarist)|Slash]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]] playing.

Other famous bands playing at Ruisrock have been such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] (1992) and [[Bon Jovi]] (1995).
