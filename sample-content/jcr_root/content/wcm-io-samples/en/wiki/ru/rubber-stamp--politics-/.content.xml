A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;rubber stamp&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as a [[list of political metaphors|political metaphor]], refers to a person or institution with  considerable &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[de jure]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; power but little &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[de facto]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; power; one that rarely disagrees with more powerful organs.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Webster&amp;apos;s NewWorld Dictionary, Second College Edition, ISBN 0-671-41809-2  -  page 1242 - &amp;quot;*rubber-stamp 2. [Colloq.] to approve or endorse in a routine manner, without thought - *rubber stamp - 2. [Colloq.] a) a person, bureau, legislature, etc., that approves or endorses something in a routine manner, without thought, b) any routine approval&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The term itself likely stems from the commonplace practice of subordinate employees or officials being deputized and given the authority to sign the name of their superior or employer.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In situations where this superior official&amp;apos;s signature may frequently be required for routine paperwork, a literal [[rubber stamp]] is used, with a likeness of their hand-written signature. In essence, the term is meant to convey an endorsement without careful thought or personal investment in the outcome, especially since it is usually expected as the stamper&amp;apos;s duty to do so. In the situation where a dictator&amp;apos;s legislature is a &amp;quot;rubber stamp&amp;quot;, the orders they are meant to endorse are formalities they are expected to legitimize, and are usually done to create the superficial appearance of legislative and dictatorial harmony rather than because they have actual power. Historian [[Edward S. Ellis]] called this type of parliament a &amp;quot;toy parliament&amp;quot;, in reference to [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Sultan]] [[Abdul Hamid II]]&amp;apos;s [[Turkey|Turkish]] parliament, created in 1876 with the sole purpose of appeasing European powers.

Conversely, in a [[constitutional monarchy]], the [[monarch]] is typically a &amp;quot;rubber stamp&amp;quot; to an elected parliament, even if he or she legally possesses considerable [[reserve power]]s and/or disagrees with the parliament&amp;apos;s decisions.
