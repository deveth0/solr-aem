&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rudolf Ewald Stier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (17 March 1800 - 16 December 1862), was a [[Germany|German]] [[Protestant]] churchman and [[mysticism|mystic]].

He was born at Fraustadt ([[Wschowa]]) in [[South Prussia]].  He studied at the [[University of Halle]] and [[Humboldt University]], [[Berlin]], first [[law]] and afterwards [[theology]]; and he continued his theological studies later at the pastoral seminary of [[Wittenberg]]. In 1824 he was made professor at the Missionary Institute in [[Basel]]. Afterwards he held pastorates at Frankleben near [[Merseburg]] (1829) and at Wichlinghausen (now part of [[Wuppertal]]) (1838). In 1850 he was appointed superintendent at [[Schkeuditz]], and in 1859 at [[Eisleben]].

He published a new edition of [[Martin Luther]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Catechism]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and a translation of the [[Bible]] based on that of Luther; but he is noted chiefly for his thoughtful, devotional and mystical commentary on the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Words of the Lord&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Reden des Herrn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 3 vols., 1843; Eng. trans., 8 vols., 1855–1858). He died at Eisleben.

His other works, besides commentaries on the [[Psalms]], Second Isaiah, [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Ephesians]], [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]], Epistles of [[Epistle of James|James]] and [[epistle of Jude|Jude]], include: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Die Reden der Apostel&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2 vols, 1824–1830; Eng. trans., 1869) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Die Reden der Engel in den heiligen Schrift&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1862). Cf. J. P. Lacroix, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Life of R. Stier&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (New York, 1874).
