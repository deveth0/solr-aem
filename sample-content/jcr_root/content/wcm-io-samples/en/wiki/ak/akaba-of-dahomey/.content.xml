&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Akaba&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an early [[King of Dahomey|King]] of the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], in present-day [[Benin]], from 1685 until &amp;apos;&amp;apos;c.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;1716.  King [[Houegbadja]] had created the basic structure of the kingdom on the Abomey plateau.  His first children were the twins of Akaba and [[Hangbe]] and they were followed by another son of Houegbadja who would become King Agaja.  As the oldest son, Akaba became the king upon Houegbadja&amp;apos;s death and ruled until 1716 when he died during battle in the [[Ouémé River|Ouémé River Valley]], either of [[small pox]] or in battle.  When he died his sister, Hangbe, became the ruler and began preparing Akaba&amp;apos;s oldest son, Agbo Sassa, for the throne.  In 1718, Agaja, the next oldest son after Akaba from [[Houegbadja]], fought with Agbo Sassa and Hangbe and became the next King of Dahomey.

==King of Dahomey==
Oral tradition records that Akaba was the eldest born child of Houegbadja with a twin sister named Hangbe.  In addition, Houegbadja also had a younger son named Dosu (the traditional name for the first male born after twins in [[Fon language|Fon]]) who would later take the name Agaja.  As the oldest son, Houegbadja named Akaba his heir before he died and Akaba assumed the throne in 1685 upon his father&amp;apos;s deaths.&amp;lt;ref name=Bay-1998&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Bay|first=Edna|title=Wives of the Leopard: Gender, Politics, and Culture in the Kingdom of Dahomey|year=1998|publisher=University of Virigina Press}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  In some versions, Akaba is the king who kills the chieftain &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to establish the dominance of the Dahomey Kingdom over the Abomey plateau, rather than Houegbadja.&amp;lt;ref name=Monroe&amp;gt;{{cite journal|last=Monroe|first=J.

Akaba&amp;apos;s administration continued military expansion off the Abomey plateau and increasing centralization of the kingdom over the region.&amp;lt;ref name=Halcrow&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Halcrow|first=Elizabeth M.|title=Canes and Chains: A Study of Sugar and Slavery|year=1982|publisher=Heinemann Educational Publishing|location=Oxford|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MMVF71JsLpEC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Some of his most significant military activity was in the [[Ouémé River]] valley.  During this campaign in around 1715-1716, Akaba died either of smallpox, poisoning, or in battle.&amp;lt;ref name=Bay-1998 /&amp;gt; Because his death was quite sudden, and his heir was still young, Edna Bay contends that his twin sister Hangbe became the regent until [[Agaja]] forcibly replaced her and the oldest son of Akaba, Agbo Sassa, to take over the throne.&amp;lt;ref name=Bay-1998 /&amp;gt;
