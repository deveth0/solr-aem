The chief deity in [[Egyptian mythology]], [[Ra]], when considered as a sun god, was thought to traverse the daytime sky in a boat, and cross the underworld at night in another one, named Meseket. As the mythology developed, so did the idea that the boat Meseket was controlled by a separate ferryman, who became known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aken&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In Egyptian mythology, the underworld was composed of the general area, named [[Duat]], and a more pleasant area to which the morally righteous were permitted, named [[Aaru]]. At the point in history at which Aken arose, [[Anubis]] had become merely the god of embalming, and [[Osiris]], though lord of the whole underworld, dwelt specifically in Aaru. Consequently, Aken was identified as the ruling the area outside of Aaru, Duat in general, on Osiris&amp;apos; behalf.

The [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] word for part of the soul &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Egyptian soul|Ba]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was also used as a word meaning &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[ram (sheep)|ram]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, therefore, Aken was usually depicted as being ram-headed. As both an underworld deity, and subservient to Osiris, Aken became known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cherti&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also spelt &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kherty&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), meaning &amp;apos;&amp;apos;(one who is) subservient&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The main center of his cult became [[Esna|Letopolis]], and it is considered a possibility that his cult caused the development of the myth of the ferryman in other Mediterranean mythologies, such as that of [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]].
