&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Akeman Street&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a major [[Roman road]] in England that linked [[Watling Street]] with the [[Fosse Way]]. Its junction with Watling Street was just north of [[Verulamium]] (near modern [[St Albans]]) and that with the [[Fosse Way]] was at [[Corinium Dobunnorum]] (now [[Cirencester]]). Its course passes through towns and villages including [[Hemel Hempstead]], [[Berkhamsted]], [[Tring]], [[Aylesbury]], [[Alchester Roman Town|Alchester]] (outside modern [[Bicester]]), [[Chesterton, Oxfordshire|Chesterton]], [[Kirtlington]], [[Ramsden, Oxfordshire|Ramsden]] and [[Asthall]]. &amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Copeland&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Copeland, Tim,  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Akeman Street&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, The History Press, 2009.  ISBN 9780752447322&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Parts of the [[A41 road]] between Tring and Bicester use the course of the former Roman road. A minor road between Chesterton and Kirtlington also uses its course. Other parts are in use as [[Rights of way in England and Wales|public footpaths]], including a {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch between [[Tackley]] and [[Stonesfield]] that is part of the [[Oxfordshire Way]].

The origins of the road&amp;apos;s name are uncertain but certainly date back to the [[Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]]. Some have suggested that &amp;quot;Akeman&amp;quot; derives from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] words for &amp;quot;oak-man&amp;quot;. Others have suggested a connection with [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], which the Anglo-Saxons called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Acemannesceastre&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Acemannes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; apparently being derived from the Roman name [[Aquae Sulis]]). It is unclear how this might have become associated with the road, but one possibility is that the name was originally used for the longer stretch of road from Bath.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.buildinghistory.org/bath/saxon/aquaemann.shtml Saxon Bath]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The name &amp;quot;Akeman Street&amp;quot; is also given to the Roman road that ran from [[Ermine Street]] near [[Wimpole Hall]] northeast to the settlement at [[Duroliponte|Durolipons]] ([[Cambridge]]), where it crossed the Roman road known as the [[Via Devana]]. Within north Cambridge, the road followed the present-day Stretten Avenue, Carlton Way and Mere Way running northeast past [[Landbeach]] before joining the present [[A10 road (Great Britain)|A10]] and on towards [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] and [[The Fens]]. It then reached [[Denver, Norfolk|Denver]] and the coast at [[Brancaster]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book | last=Gray |first=Ronald D | coauthors=Stubbings, Derek | title= Cambridge Street-Names: Their Origins and Associations |publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2000 | location=Cambridge | pages=2â€“3}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
