He was a member of the party&amp;apos;s 2010/11 candidate college and sought selection as the National candidate in the [[North Shore (New Zealand electorate)|North Shore]] electorate for the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 general election]], losing to [[Maggie Barry]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/national/politics/4907671/Political-briefs-Wednesday-April-20 Mapping out a new political landscape] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Press&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 20 April 2011&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He also unsuccessfully sought selection for the [[Epsom (New Zealand electorate)|Epsom]] seat.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/5194631/Six-seat-Nationals-Epsom-spot Six seat National&amp;apos;s Epsom spot] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;stuff.co.nz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 26 June 2011&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Prior to joining the National Party McQueen joined the [[Christian Heritage Party of New Zealand|Christian Heritage Party]] in 1992, and stood as a Christian Heritage candidate on five occasions. Four of his campaigns were in the Auckland electorates of Eden, Epsom and Mt Roskill, but his most successful election campaign was in the [[Taranaki-King Country by-election 1998|Taranaki-King Country by-election]] in 1998, in which he placed fifth. He also served as his party&amp;apos;s deputy leader and finance spokesperson until 1999.

McQueen narrowly missed election to parliament as a Christian Heritage candidate in the [[New Zealand general election, 1996]].

In August 2003, McQueen was elected as the new leader of Christian Heritage, and replaced the retiring [[Graham Capill]].

McQueen became a [[Christianity|Christian]] when aged eighteen, and said that his belief gave &amp;quot;hope, meaning, direction and strength.&amp;quot; He stated a belief that he was &amp;quot;called to politics&amp;quot; in the same way that others might be called &amp;quot;to be a pastor or evangelist or such like.&amp;quot; He opposed [[civil unions]], saying that they were similar to marriage.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/civil-unions/news/article.cfm?c_id=565&amp;amp;objectid=3575071 Dunne is having a bob each way say critics]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In October 2006, McQueen announced the closure of Christian Heritage New Zealand, blaming its demise on Graham Capill&amp;apos;s criminal convictions, although he hoped to be involved with a new conservative Christian political party .&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0610/S00018.htm]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
