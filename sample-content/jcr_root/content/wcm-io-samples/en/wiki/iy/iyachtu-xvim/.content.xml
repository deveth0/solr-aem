==History==
During the [[Time of Troubles (Forgotten Realms)|Time of Troubles]], the then-[[demigod]] Xvim was imprisoned within the depths of [[Zhentil Keep]].  After the end of the Time of Troubles and his father&amp;apos;s demise, Iyachtu Xvim was granted his father&amp;apos;s command of [[hatred]], and [[tyranny]], and elevated to godhood.  For little over a decade, Xvim reigned as a minor god, a feeble successor to his fearsome sire.  During his existence, Xvim was petty, power-hungry, and ruthless, in some ways like his father.  However, he was not nearly as strong, especially in comparison with the other &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; deity in the [[List of Forgotten Realms deities|Faerûnian Pantheon]], [[Cyric]].

In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tymora&amp;apos;s Luck&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Xvim impersonated [[Sirrion]] in a bid to seize the portfolios of [[Tymora]] and [[Beshaba]], when [[Lathander]] attempted to re-create [[Tyche]] by reuniting the two goddesses. (Tyche became Tymora and Beshaba after becoming corrupted by [[Moander]] during the Dawn Cataclysm.) His plan was foiled by [[Finder Wyvernspur]] and his priest Joel, who threw the two halves of the Finder&amp;apos;s Stone into the fusion chamber. Xvim fled, but his realm, the Bastion of Hate, was already destroyed by [[Beshaba]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Kate Novak]] &amp;amp; [[Jeff Grubb]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tymora&amp;apos;s Luck&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (TSR, 1997)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Then, on [[Midwinter]] night of 1372 DR, the young god was consumed by a blazing green fire, from which emerged a resurrected Bane.  Nearly all former clerics of Xvim (who in turn shifted to his allegiance after the death of his father) repledged themselves to the Church of Bane.  Xvim is now considered a dead god, and for as long as his father holds on to divinity, he will probably remain as such.
