        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Q40&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Q60&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (sometimes known generically as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Qx0&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; series) are [[computer]] [[motherboard]]s designed  in the late 1990s, based on the [[Motorola 68040]] and [[68060]] [[microprocessors]] respectively and intended to be partially compatible with the [[Sinclair QL]] [[microcomputer]]. They were by designed by Peter Graf of [[Germany]] and manufactured by D&amp;amp;D Systems of the [[United Kingdom]].

== Hardware ==
The Q40 consists of a sub-[[AT form factor]] board comprising a 40 MHz 68040 processor, 1 MiB of video RAM, and several [[Programmable logic device|PLDs]] implementing a QL-compatible video display generator, an [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus, stereo 20 kHz audio [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]]s and an [[AT keyboard]] interface. [[Floppy disk]], [[AT Attachment|ATA]] [[hard disk]], [[RS-232]] and [[Centronics printer port]] interfaces are provided by an ISA &amp;quot;multi-I/O&amp;quot; card in one of the two ISA slots provided. Up to 32 MiB of FPM or EDO RAM can be installed in two 72-pin [[SIMM]] slots. Also included are sockets for two ROM devices, 2 kiB of non-volatile RAM and a [[real-time clock]].

Both of the QL&amp;apos;s standard video modes are supported, plus two extended modes: 512×256 or 1024×512 pixels with 16-bit colour.

The Q60 is a revised board with a 66 MHz 68060 or 80 MHz 68LC060 processor and support for up to 128 MiB of RAM.

The Q40 board was produced in limited quantities before being superseded by the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Q40i&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; essentially a Q60 board with a 40 MHz 68040.

== Software ==
Three [[operating system]]s are available for the Q40/Q60; these comprise QDOS Classic (an enhanced version of [[Sinclair QDOS|Qdos 1.10]]), [[SMSQ/E]] and a custom [[Linux distribution]].
