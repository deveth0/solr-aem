There were two characters named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Epeius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-grc|Ἐπειός}}) in [[Greek mythology]].

#A Greek soldier during the [[Trojan War]]. He was the son of [[Panopeus (mythology)|Panopeus]] and had the reputation for being a coward.  In the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Iliad]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; he participated in the boxing match at the funeral games for [[Patrocles]] against [[Euryalus]] and won.  Later during the funeral games for [[Achilleus]] he fought [[Acamas]] the son of [[Theseus]] to a stalemate.  He built the [[Trojan Horse]], commissioned by [[Odysseus]] because [[Athena]] had told him in a dream she would be with him to help build it. The horse was hollow and was large enough to hold 30 Greek soldiers equipped with all their armor but Epeius made the Trojan horse so tall that it could not fit through any of the gates of Troy.  The trap door of the horse was fastened with a special catch that only Epeius could undo.  After constructing the massive horse, he chose the other 29 soldiers that would accompany him inside the horse. He also founded [[Pisa (Greece)|Pisa]] and [[Metapontum]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Virgil]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aeneid&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, II, 264.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
#Son of King [[Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]] of [[Elis]].  He ran a race at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], against his brothers [[Aetolus (son of Endymion)| Aetolus]] and [[Paeon (son of Endymion)|Paeon]], winning his father&amp;apos;s kingdom. He was married to Anaxiroe, daughter of [[Coronus (Greek mythology)|Coronus]], and had one daughter, [[Hyrmine]]. [[Oenomaus]] was his contemporary.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; Pausanias [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+5.1.4&amp;amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160 5.1.4] - 5. 1. 6.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The alternative spelling of &amp;quot;Epeus&amp;quot; may also be encountered.
