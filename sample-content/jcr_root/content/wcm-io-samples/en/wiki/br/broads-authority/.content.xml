The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Broads Authority&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the agency which has statutory responsibility for [[the Broads]] in England. Originally, the [[Nature Conservancy Council]] (now [[Natural England]]), pressed for a special authority to manage the Broads which had been neglected for a long time. In 1978, the forerunner to the present-day Broads Authority was established by the Countryside Commission (now also [[Natural England]]). Ten years later, it had become clear that a statutory body was needed, and a special [[Act of Parliament]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1988 (referred to as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the Broads Act&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) made the Broads Authority into a [[Special Statutory Authority]] which gave it parity with [[national park]] authorities.

==Responsibilities==
The Broads Authority has to:
*conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the Broads
*promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the Broads by the public
*protect the interests of [[navigation]] (as [[navigation authority]])
*have regard for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]]
*have regard for the [[economic]] and [[Social issues|social]] interests of those who live or work in the Broads.

==Second act==
In 2006 the Broads Authority promoted a second act, the primary purpose of which was to introduce greater safety controls on the broads and rivers. This act received Royal Assent in July 2009.

==Members==
The Broads Authority is not democratically elected. Members are either co-opted from local authorities (to which they have been elected) or appointed by the [[Secretary of State]] for the Environment. The Broads Authority was formerly represented by one member on the [[East of England Regional Assembly]], now defunct.
