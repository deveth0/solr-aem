}}bird #309.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Megalaima zeylanica&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is an [[Asian barbet]].  Barbets and [[toucan]]s are a group of [[near passerine]] [[bird]]s with a worldwide tropical distribution. The barbets get their name from the bristles which fringe their heavy bills.

The Brown-headed Barbet is a resident breeder in the [[Indian Subcontinent]], widespread in [[India]] and also seen in [[Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. It is an [[arboreal]] species of gardens and wooded country which eats [[fruit]] and [[insect]]s.  Nonetheless, it is fairly tolerant of humans and is often seen in cities, in greenery. It nests in a tree hole, laying 2-4 [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s.  The bird is largely frugivorous on mangos, ripe jack, papaya, banana, figs and similar cultivated fruit trees.  Its habitat includes urban and country gardens though it tends to eschew heavy forest.  It nests in a suitable hole in a tree that it will often excavate out, not unlike a woodpecker.  A pair will take it in turns to incubate the eggs and they often communicate with each other using their &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kura, kura&amp;apos;&amp;apos; calls.

This is a relatively large barbet at 27&amp;amp;nbsp;cm. It is a plump bird, with a short neck, large head and short tail.

The adult has a streaked brown head, neck and breast, with a yellow eye patch. The rest of the [[Feather|plumage]] is green. The bill is thick and red. Sexes are similar.

The [[White-cheeked Barbet]] largely replaces this species in the [[Western Ghats]] and hilly parts of southern peninsular India although both species may occur in many places. The calls of this species is similar but the white cheek patch is distinctive.

The call is a repetitive &amp;apos;&amp;apos;kutroo…kutroo…kutroo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  Others take up the call when one starts.  Somewhat silent in the winter.

==In culture==

In [[Sri Lanka]], this bird is known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Polos Kottoruwa&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the [[Sinhala Language]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.flickr.com/photos/arunasene/3037225610&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.bnhsenvis.nic.in/pdf/vol%203%20(1).pdf&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
