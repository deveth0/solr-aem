&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Brussels&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a community in [[Huron County, Ontario|Huron County]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], located within the municipality of [[Huron East, Ontario|Huron East]]. It was originally called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ainleyville&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The name was changed in 1872 when a branch line of the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] from [[Guelph]] came through the town. Brussels has seen the population grow over the years, in 1954,
the population was 827.

Formerly an incorporated village in its own right, Brussels had a population of 1,143 in the [[Canada 2001 Census]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;amp;Code1=3540044&amp;amp;Geo2=PR&amp;amp;Code2=35&amp;amp;Data=Count&amp;amp;SearchText=Brussels&amp;amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;amp;SearchPR=01&amp;amp;B1=All&amp;amp;GeoLevel=&amp;amp;GeoCode=3540044 Canada 2001 Census Community Profiles: Brussels, Ontario]. [[Statistics Canada]].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was amalgamated into the municipality of Huron East on January 1, 2001.

The [[Ronald Streamer]], a piece of firefight equipment, was made in Brussels.&amp;lt;ref name=ronald&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegfiremuseum.ca/apparatus.htm|title=Apparatus|publisher=The Firefighters Museum, Winnipeg|accessdate=2007-07-07}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
Brussels is 16 miles north of [[Seaforth, Ontario|Seaforth]] and 5 miles north of [[Walton, Ontario|Walton]]. Brussels was created as the village of Ainleyville in 1855, founded by William Ainlay (difference in spelling is due to clerical error).
Back in the late 19th century Brussels had a post office, a flour mill, a grist mill, a sawmill, a hair salon, and a fanning mill.
