The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bridger Mountains&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are a short subrange of the [[Rocky Mountains]], approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} long, in central [[Wyoming]] in the [[United States]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite peakbagger |rid=14424 |name=Bridger Mountains}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The range forms a bridge between the [[Owl Creek Mountains]] to the west and the southern end of the [[Bighorn Mountains]] to the east. The [[Wind River (Wyoming)|Wind River]] passes through the gap between the range and the Owl Creek Mountains. [[Bridger Creek]] passes through the gap between the range and the Bighorns.  The highest point in the range is Copper Mountain at {{convert|8300|ft|m}}.

The range is named after [[Jim Bridger]], who pioneered the [[Bridger Trail]] through the mountains from southern Wyoming into the [[Bighorn Basin]] in 1864.
