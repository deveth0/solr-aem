&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Brown Hill Creek&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in [[South Australia]], {{coord|34|59|S|138|39|E|region:AU-SA}}, is one of several creeks (or [[stream]]s) running in a generally west-north-west direction, draining the western watershed of the [[Mount Lofty Ranges]].

The creek runs through the suburb of [[Brown Hill Creek, South Australia|Brown Hill Creek]] with the area around the mouth of creek in the suburb of [[Mitcham, South Australia|Mitcham]]. This area was known to the [[Kaurna people|Kaurna]] people of the Adelaide Plains as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wirraparinga&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, meaning &amp;quot;creek and scrub place&amp;quot;. After the proclamation of [[Adelaide]] on 28 December 1836, one of the earliest outlying communities to spring up was that of Mitcham, in 1840.

The dominating hill behind Mitcham is called [[Brown Hill, Mitcham, South Australia|Brown Hill]], along with two other significant hills in the Adelaide hills face, Greenhill and Black Hill. It was grazed early on in the history of Adelaide&amp;apos;s white settlement, and has since retained a cover of grass, with few trees or shrubs, thus appearing brown in summer, and green in winter.

The creek valley behind the hill has contained some form of [[park]] for many years;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/parks/Find_a_Park/Browse_by_region/Adelaide_Hills/Brownhill_Creek_Recreation_Park Brownhill Creek Recreation Park]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; a stone plaque declaring a &amp;quot;pleasure resort&amp;quot; from the early part of the 20th century still stands at the entrance to the valley. Today, there is a popular caravan park in the mouth of the valley, and a recreation reserve extending several kilometres up the main creek valley behind it. The upper reaches of the creek are utilised especially for [[market gardening]], and also some [[pasture]]. In the 1870s, some of the upper gullies of the creek were considered as a possible location for a [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]], to supply Adelaide&amp;apos;s growing population with [[water]]. Thorndon Park reservoir was eventually built instead.

There is an old and very large hollow river red gum (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Eucalyptus]] [[Eucalyptus camaldulensis|camaldulensis]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), known as the Monarch of the Glen, that survives today in the centre of the caravan park; its interior was partly burnt by adventurous [[Scouts Australia|Scouts]] many years ago, and it is now surrounded by a fence.
