&amp;lt;!--TO EDITORS: The lyrics to the &amp;quot;Bruces&amp;apos; Song&amp;quot; are copyrighted and are not to be included in this article.--&amp;gt;
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bruces&amp;apos; Philosophers Song (Bruces&amp;apos; Song)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a popular [[Monty Python]] song written by [[Eric Idle]], and was a feature of the group&amp;apos;s stage appearances and its recordings.  According to the sketch from [[Monty Python&amp;apos;s Flying Circus]], it was rendered by a number of Australian university lecturers. They were all called Bruce and taught at the [[Philosophy]] Department of the University of Woolloomooloo. ([[Woolloomooloo, New South Wales|Woolloomooloo]] is an inner suburb of [[Sydney]]. There is actually no university there, though the real-life [[University of Sydney|Sydney University]] is not far away.) Although the fictitious faculty first appeared in the [[Bruces sketch]] in the TV show [[Monty Python&amp;apos;s Flying Circus]], the song itself was not included, making its debut on the album [[Matching Tie and Handkerchief]] as a coda for the sketch.  It was subsequently included in most of their live shows, sometimes as a singalong.

The song&amp;apos;s lyrics make a series of scurrilous allegations against a number of highly respected philosophers, usually with regard to their capacity or incapacity for imbibing [[alcoholic beverage|intoxicating liquors]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wPQelKFNA5MC&amp;amp;pg=RA1-PA274 |title=Monty Python and philosophy: nudge nudge, think think! |author=Gary L. Hardcastle, George A. Reisch}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

There is some debate over whether the sixth line is officially supposed to be &amp;quot;[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]&amp;quot; or just &amp;quot;Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel&amp;quot;. The reason for the confusion is that existing live recordings of the song (included in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl&amp;apos;&amp;apos; film and on the albums &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Live at Drury Lane&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Live at City Center&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) have the &amp;quot;Schopenhauer and Hegel&amp;quot; version, while the studio recording on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief|Matching Tie and Handkerchief]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; features the &amp;quot;Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel&amp;quot; version. However, the publication of the lyrics with the release of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Monty Python Sings]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; suggests that the &amp;quot;Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel&amp;quot; version is the official one.

All the thinkers whom the song mentions were dead by the time it appeared, apart from [[Martin Heidegger]].

Philosophers mentioned in the song (in order):

#[[Immanuel Kant]]
#[[Martin Heidegger]]
#[[David Hume]]
#[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (some versions)
#[[G.W.F. Hegel]]
#[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]
#[[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]] and/or [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]]
#[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]
#[[Socrates]] (the only one mentioned twice in the song)
#[[John Stuart Mill]]
#[[Plato]]
#[[Aristotle]]
#[[Thomas Hobbes]]
#[[RenÃ© Descartes]]

==Philosophical references==
Some of the philosophers are portrayed according to their works.
* Kant being &amp;quot;very rarely stable&amp;quot; harkens to his theory of a stable universe.
* John Stuart Mill becoming ill &amp;quot;of his own free will&amp;quot; alludes to his work &amp;apos;&amp;apos;On Liberty&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which argues for liberty that does no harm to others.
* Plato is, famously, the author of the dialogue [[Symposium]], taking place at a drinking party, as the title itself says. Socrates appears prominently in it.
* The Descartes line, &amp;quot;I drink therefore I am&amp;quot;, is a twist on his well known phrase &amp;quot;Cogito, ergo sum,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;[[I think therefore I am]]&amp;quot;.
