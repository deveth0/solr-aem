&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bharatiya Jana Sangh&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (abbreviated &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;BJS&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)  a political arm of [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] was an Indian nationalist political party that existed from 1951 to 1977. In 1977, it merged with several other [[Left-wing politics|left]], [[Political centre|centre]] and [[Right-wing politics|right]] parties opposed to the dictatorial and dynastic rule of the [[Indian National Congress]] and formed the [[Janata Party]] coalition. After the Janata Party split in 1980, it was succeeded by the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], which is one of India&amp;apos;s largest political parties today.

The BJS was started by [[Syama Prasad Mookerjee]] on 21 October 1951 in [[Delhi]] in consultation with the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]]. The symbol of the party in Indian elections was an oil lamp. In the 1952 general elections to the [[Parliament of India]], Bharatiya Jana Sangh won three seats, Mookerjee being one of the winning candidates. The BJS would often link up on issues and debates with the right-wing [[Swatantra Party]] of [[Chakravarti Rajgopalachari]]. Its strongest parliamentary performance came in the 1967 elections, when the Congress majority was its thinnest ever.

==Hindu Nationalism==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;See also&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: [[Hindu nationalism]], [[Hindutva]]

The BJS was ideologically close to the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]], and derived most of its political activist base and candidates from the RSS ranks. The [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]], formed in 1964, would later become the religious arm of the RSS.

The BJS also attracted many economically conservative members of the [[Indian National Congress]] who were disenchanted with the more socialist policies and politics of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and the Congress Party. The BJS&amp;apos;s strongest constituencies were in [[Rajasthan]], [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]].

The BJS leadership strongly supported a stringent policy against [[Pakistan]] and [[China]], and were averse to the [[USSR]] and [[communism]]. Many BJS leaders also inaugurated the drive to ban cow slaughter nationwide in the early 1960s.

==Emergency==
In 1975, [[Indira Gandhi]] declared a state of [[Indian Emergency|Emergency]], and threw many major opposition politicians in jail including the leaders of the BJS. In 1977, the Emergency was withdrawn, and elections were held. The BJS, joined forces with the [[Bharatiya Lok Dal]], the [[Indian National Congress (Organization)|Congress (O)]], and the [[Socialist Party (India)|Socialist Party]], to form the [[Janata Party]] (People&amp;apos;s Party). The Janata Party became the first Indian government not led by the [[Indian National Congress]]. Former BJS leaders [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] and [[L. K. Advani]] became the External Affairs (Foreign), and Information and Broadcasting Ministers respectively.
