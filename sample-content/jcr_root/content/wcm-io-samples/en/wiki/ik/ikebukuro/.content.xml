{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ikebukuro&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|池袋}} is a commercial and entertainment district in [[Toshima, Tokyo]], Japan. Toshima ward offices, [[Ikebukuro station]], and several shops, restaurants, and enormous department stores are located within city limits.

At the center of Ikebukuro is the train and subway station, a huge urban gathering shared by the [[East Japan Railway Company|JR East]] lines, the [[Seibu Ikebukuro Line]] and the [[Tōbu Tōjō Line]]. It is one of the main commuter hubs in the western Yamanote area of Tokyo. [[Ikebukuro Station]] is the second busiest station in Japan, second only to [[Shinjuku Station]].

Around the station are the [[Seibu Department Stores|Seibu]] and Tōbu [[department store]]s. [[Seibu Railway|Seibu]], written with the characters for &amp;quot;West&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;[[Musashi Province|Musashi (province)]]&amp;quot; 西武, is on the east end of the station and [[Tobu|Tōbu]], written with the characters for &amp;quot;East&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Musashi&amp;quot; 東武, is on the west end. East of the station, on the site of [[Sugamo Prison]], stands [[Sunshine 60]], which was Tokyo&amp;apos;s tallest building at the time of its construction. Adjacent to Sunshine City, on [[Meiji-Dori]] is the Toyota Amlux Building which houses the Toyota showroom. [[Otome Road]], a leading shopping area for [[otaku]] products aimed at women, is located nearby. [[Marui]] and [[Don Quijote (store)|Don Quijote]] also have department stores in the area. The principal electronics retailer in Ikebukuro is [[Bic Camera]]. There is a small pleasure district located in [[Nishi-Ikebukuro]], similar to [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]]&amp;apos;s [[Kabukichō, Tokyo|Kabukichō]].

The old village of Ikebukuro stood to the northwest of the station. Most of the area on which modern Ikebukuro is built was historically known as [[Sugamo]]. In the [[Taishō period|Taishō]] and [[Showa period|Shōwa]] periods, the relatively low land prices attracted artists and foreign workers, who lent a somewhat cosmopolitan atmosphere to Ikebukuro. Until October 1, 1932 when Toshima ward was established, the area was an independent [[Municipalities of Japan|municipality]] of Ikebukuro-[[Villages of Japan|mura]] (池袋村).

The [[kanji]] for Ikebukuro literally means &amp;apos;&amp;apos;pond bag&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Outside the west exit of Ikebukuro station near an entrance to the Fukutoshin Line is a small plaque explaining how the area used to have multiple lakes, hence the name.

There is a small statue of an owl located near the center of the city called Ikefukurō-zō (いけふくろう像), meaning &amp;apos;&amp;apos;lake owl statue&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It is a play on words from the alternative meaning of &amp;quot;fukuro&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;owl&amp;quot; (although owl is pronounced with a long final &amp;quot;oh&amp;quot;, rather than a short &amp;quot;o&amp;quot; in the word &amp;quot;fukuro&amp;quot; for bag). The owl statue has become a famous meeting place along the lines of the statue of [[Hachikō]] located outside of [[Shibuya Station]].
