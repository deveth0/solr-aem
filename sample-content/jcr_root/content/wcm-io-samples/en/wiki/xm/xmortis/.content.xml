        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xmortis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a monthly [[Goth subculture|goth]] [[Club night|night]], held on the second Friday of the month, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

==History==

Xmortis was started in July of 2004. The event was founded by Latex Lily&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://thephoenix.com/BLOGS/eroticenquirer/archive/2008/04/03/1001-nights.aspx&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and Patman the Avenger, who, at the time, were a longtime couple in the [[Boston]] goth scene, their romance was featured in the [[Boston Globe]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2004/02/08/gothic_romance/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Xmortis&amp;apos; predecessor was a goth event called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hell&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (known for its catchy title; event-goers could say they were &amp;quot;going to Hell&amp;quot;). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hell&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was held monthly at [[Manray]], Boston&amp;apos;s best-known goth club, until the event ended in its 11th year. Xmortis continued the tradition at Manray, until the club&amp;apos;s close in July 2005. Xmortis was then moved across the street, to the well-known rock club [[T.T. The Bear&amp;apos;s Place]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.ttthebears.com/ T.T. The Bear&amp;apos;s Place]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Today, Xmortis continues its residency at TT&amp;apos;s, with DJ [[Chris Ewen]] of the [[Future Bible Heroes]], Terri, the iconic [[Manray]] bartender, and a range of guest DJs.

==Themes==
Though Xmortis is a goth night, the events typically feature a different theme each month. Past themes include &amp;apos;&amp;apos;X-Mortis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (a comic book-themed night, the name is styled with the hyphen, a la [[X-Men]]),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.boston.com/ae/events/articles/2008/07/11/dancing_in_superhero_style/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Monster A-Go-Go&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (a night of gothic greasers, and vintage horror), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fashion Victims&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a night of gothic fashion shows.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.boston.com/yourlife/fashion/articles/2004/11/11/beyond_the_pale/ Beyond the Pale], [[Boston Globe]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
