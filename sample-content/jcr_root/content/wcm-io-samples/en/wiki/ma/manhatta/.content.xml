&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Manhatta&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[1921 in film|1921]]) is a short [[documentary film]] directed by painter [[Charles Sheeler]] and photographer [[Paul Strand]].

==Production background==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Manhatta&amp;apos;&amp;apos; documents the look of early-20th-century [[Manhattan]]. With the city as subject, the film consists of 65 shots sequenced in a loose non-narrative structure, beginning with a ferry approaching Manhattan and ending with a sunset view from a [[skyscraper]]. The primary objective of the film is to explore the relationship between photography and film; camera movement is kept to a minimum, as is incidental motion within each shot. Each frame provides a view of the city that has been carefully arranged into abstract compositions.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/artists_view/manhatta_main.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The film was an attempt to show the filmmakers&amp;apos; love for the city of [[New York City|New York]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Manhatta&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a collaboration between painter Charles Sheeler and photographer Paul Strand. The [[intertitle]]s include excerpts from the writings of [[Walt Whitman]].

==Preservation status==
The film has been deemed &amp;quot;culturally significant&amp;quot; by the [[Library of Congress]], selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]], and was restored for the DVD set &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant Garde Film 1894-1941|Unseen Cinema]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in October 2005. The film was completely restored in January 2009 by archivist Bruce Posner, working with film restoration company [[Lowry Digital]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lowrydigital.com/filmography.html|title=Filmography|publisher=Lowry Digital|accessdate=2009-06-28}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Posner spent close to four years returning the film to its original glory.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://kcet.org/local/blogs/blur_sharpen/2009/01/proud-and-passionate-city.html|title=Proud and Passionate City|last=Willis|first=Holly|date=2009-01-19|work=Blur + Sharpen|publisher=KCET Online / Community Television of Southern California|accessdate=2009-06-28}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
