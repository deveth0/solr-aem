&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mac&amp;apos;s Convenience Stores&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Inc. is a chain of [[convenience store]]s in [[Canada]]. The Company is divided into three geographic business units: Eastern Canada, Central Canada and Western Canada. It has been owned and operated by [[Alimentation Couche-Tard]] since 1999.

==History==
Mac&amp;apos;s Milk Limited was incorporated in [[Ontario]] on April 4, 1962 by Kenneth and Carl McGowen. The name was changed to Mac&amp;apos;s Convenience Stores Limited on May 7, 1975. On July 5, 1963, Silverwood Dairies Limited acquired 40% of the shares of Mac&amp;apos;s Milk Limited, and increased its holding to 80% on March 29, 1968, and 100% on January 12, 1972.

In 1971, 18 convenience stores operating under the &amp;quot;Little Z Convenience Stores&amp;quot; banner were purchased from [[Zehrs Markets]]. In 1974, thirteen Mini-Mart convenience stores in [[Vancouver]] were purchased from a subsidiary of the [[George Weston Limited|Weston]] organization. Also in 1974, seven Starlite Variety Stores operating in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] were purchased. In 1976, shares of Royal Oak Dairy were purchased by Silverwood Dairies Limited, including operations of convenience stores under the Bantam and Astro names.

In 1994, most Mac&amp;apos;s stores in Quebec were sold to Couche-Tard (which bought Mac&amp;apos;s in 1999), rebranding Mac&amp;apos;s stores in Quebec as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;DÃ©pan-Escompte Couche-Tard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Silcorp, the parent company of Mac&amp;apos;s, acquired 163 [[Southern Ontario]] stores, and assets of rival [[Becker&amp;apos;s]] in November, 1996. On April 14, 1999, Silcorp shares (including the Mac&amp;apos;s and Becker&amp;apos;s brands), were purchased by Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. Mac&amp;apos;s dropped its longtime cat logo with a cat, and replaced it with Couche-Tard&amp;apos;s owl logo.

In May 2006, Mac&amp;apos;s introduced a memorable [[advertising]] campaign for their [[Froster]] beverage. The campaign centred on the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Whack&amp;apos;&amp;apos; flavour and used [[double entendre]]s involving the word, such as &amp;quot;I think I could have a Whack every day if I could&amp;quot;, and humorously censored &amp;quot;[[Masturbation|Whack]]&amp;quot; in the commercials.

In May 2007, Mac&amp;apos;s introduced a controversial advertising campaign for their new WTF Froster beverage. Targeting primarily net savvy teenage boys, the campaign included posters and a series of viral internet video ads. The controversy stemmed from the use of the WTF [[internet slang]] acronym (&amp;quot;what the fuck&amp;quot;), a poster of a nun and goat bowing in the presence of a cup of WTF and video ads portraying sexual innuendo and bizarre or questionable conduct. In response Mac&amp;apos;s pulled the more controversial ads and has stated that it intended WTF to refer to &amp;quot;What&amp;apos;s the flavour?&amp;quot;

Mac&amp;apos;s stores sell [[Seattle&amp;apos;s Best Coffee|Seattle&amp;apos;s Best]] brewed coffee in Western Canada, and [[Van Houtte|A.L. Van Houtte coffee]] in Quebec, and in Ontario, under the banner name of Sunshine Joe.

==Mascot==
[[Image:Macs cat logo.svg|thumb|170px|The original mascot]]The original [[mascot]] for Mac&amp;apos;s was a cat named MacIntosh wearing a [[tam o&amp;apos;shanter]] and a [[kilt]], holding a jug of milk.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/160/407851323_3827e7151f.jpg?v=0&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Following Mac&amp;apos;s acquisition by Couche-Tard In 1999, it was changed to the winking owl named Hibou (seen above), which was the mascot for the Winks chain of convenience stores and gas stations.
