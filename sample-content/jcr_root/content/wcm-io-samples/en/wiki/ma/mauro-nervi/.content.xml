        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mauro Nervi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1959) is an [[Italy|Italian]] poet in the [[Esperanto]] language.

Nervi was born in [[La Spezia]], a port town in northern Italy. A student of [[medicine]], he gained his M.D. as a general [[surgery|surgeon]]. Since 1984 he has worked in the Department of Surgery at the University of [[Pisa]]. Afterwards, he received a Ph.D in 1994 in German and a Ph.D in classical literature in 1999 from the same university. Since 1995 he has written critical material on [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]] and [[Holderlin]] in cooperation with the Department of German Studies.

Nervi married with Angela in 1992 and has two daughters, Serena (2002) and Dorabella (2005). He is now interested in [[philosophy]] and [[logic]].

== Works ==
Nervi first gained renown for his poems when he was only 18 years old, and 1978 saw the publication of his first collection &amp;apos;&amp;apos;La turoj de l&amp;apos; ĉefurbo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;The Towers of the Capital&amp;quot;). Although in retrospect some parts are immature, here the young Nervi already showed impressive skill. From his knowledge of classical literature came several poems from this volume, including a poetic drama based on the murder of [[Agamemnon]] by [[Clytemnestra]], and a cycle of seven poems, each for one of the [[Muses]].

After the publication of his first book, Nervi continued to write poetry, which appeared in several literary reviews including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fonto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Literatura Foiro&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 1986 his translation in Esperanto of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Il repertorio della memoria&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Eugenio Montale]] was used as the introduction to [[Spomenka Štimec]]&amp;apos;s novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ombro sur interna pejzaĝo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. 1996 saw the appearance of his translation of [[Franz Kafka]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Metamorphosis]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Nervi&amp;apos;s second collection, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Havenoj&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Ports&amp;quot;) was published in 2001. Leaving behind the classical themes of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;La turoj de l&amp;apos; ĉefurbo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Havenoj&amp;apos;&amp;apos; contains much sea imagery and was also inspired in part by his studies of German literature, for which he received his second doctorate.

For his poetry Nervi has gained several literary prizes.
