{{For|a wealthy or powerful business baron or executive|Business magnate}}

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Magnate&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, from the [[Late Latin]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;magnas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a great man, itself from [[Latin]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;magnus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;great&amp;apos;, designates a noble or other man in a high social position, by birth, wealth or other qualities. In reference to the [[Middle Ages]], the term is often used to distinguish higher territorial landowners and warlords such as [[count]]s, [[earl]]s, [[duke]]s, and territorial-[[prince]]s from the [[baron]]age.

== Hungary ==
The term was specifically applied to the members (equivalent to British Peers) of the Upper House in the [[Apostolic Majesty|Apostolic Kingdom of Hungary]], the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Főrendiház&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or [[House of Magnates]].

== Poland and Lithuania ==
{{main|Magnates of Poland and Lithuania}}
Magnates were a [[social class]] of wealthy and influential [[nobility]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] (and later the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]), see [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania]]

== Serbia ==
{{further|Serbian nobility}}
In the Middle Ages, the Serbian nobility was roughly divided into the &amp;quot;magnates&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;nobles&amp;quot;.

During [[Ottoman Serbia|Ottoman rule]], [[Serbian Revolution|the Revolution]], and [[Principality of Serbia|Principality]] the magnates were influential Serb voivodes (all voivodes were not considered magnates).

== Spain ==

In Spain, since late Middle Ages there is the highest class of nobility who hold appellation of [[Grandee of Spain]].

== Sweden ==
{{further|Swedish nobility}}
In Sweden, wealthiest medieval lords were known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;storman&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (plural &amp;apos;&amp;apos;stormän&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), &amp;quot;great men&amp;quot;, a similar description as magnate, and same meaning.

== England ==

In England, the term magnate has often been applied to the extremely powerful nobles that Edward III created when he split his kingdom amongst his sons rather than choosing one son to inherit the entire kingdom. The ensuing conflict between these powerful nobles (and their successors) and whoever was king led to the aristocratic wars known as the [[Wars of the Roses]]. A similar class in the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] world were the [[Flatha]].

In the Middle Ages a [[bishop]] sometimes held territory as a magnate, collecting the revenue of the [[Manorialism|manor]]s and the associated [[knight&amp;apos;s fee|knights&amp;apos; fees]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The large number of extremely powerful nobles, many of whom had claims to the throne, led to over 100 years of aristocratic [[civil war]], in the form of the [[Wars of the Roses]].

Eventually intermarriage between the royal family and the higher nobility led to large numbers of claimants to the throne, most of whom tried to attain the throne by usurping their predecessors. In this period, despite laws governing succession, most of the succession was determined not as much by [[primogeniture]] as by military victory.

In the Tudor period, after [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] defeated [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] at [[Battle of Bosworth Field|Bosworth Field]], Henry made a point of executing or neutralizing as many magnates as possible. Henry VII would make parliament [[attainder|attaint]] undesirable nobles and magnates, thereby stripping them of their wealth, protection from torture, and power. Henry VII also used the [[Court of the Star Chamber]] to have powerful nobles executed. [[Henry VIII]] continued this approach in his reign; he inherited a survivalistic mistrust of nobles from his father. Henry VIII ennobled very few men and the ones he did were all &amp;quot;new men&amp;quot;: [[novus homo|novi homines]], greatly indebted to him and having very limited power.
