The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Malians&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-grc|Μαλιεῖς}}) were a [[Greeks|Greek]] tribe that resided at the mouth of the river [[Spercheios]] in [[Greece]]. The [[Malian Gulf]] is named after them. In the western valley of the [[Spercheios]], their land was adjacent to the [[Aenianes]]. Their main town was [[Trachis]]. In the town of [[Anthele]], the Malians had an important temple of [[Demeter]], an early centre of the Delphinian [[Amphictiony]]. In 426 BCE, the Malians asked [[Sparta]] for help in their war against the [[Oitaian]]s. The Spartans then founded the town [[Heracleia Trachinia]] in place of Trachis. In the following decades, the Malians were under the hegemony of Sparta until they revolted against Sparta in the [[Corinthian War]]. In this war, they lost their land south of the Spercheios, Herakleia Trachis was given to the Oitaians, and [[Lamia (city)|Lamia]] became the new capital of the Malians. Together with the Oitaians and the Ainians, the Malians became members of the [[Corinthian League]] and, in 235 BCE, the League of [[Aetolia]]. In 189 BCE they were joined to [[Achaea Phthiotis]] and since that time the Malians were regarded as [[Thessaly|Thessalians]].
