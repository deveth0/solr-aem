&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Matching Mole&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an English [[jazz rock]] [[musical band|band]] associated with the [[Canterbury scene]]. [[Robert Wyatt]] formed the band in October 1971 after he left [[Soft Machine]] and recorded his first solo album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The End of an Ear]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He continued his role on vocals and drums and was joined by [[Dave Sinclair (keyboardist)|David Sinclair]], of [[Caravan (band)|Caravan]], on organ and piano, [[Phil Miller]] on guitar and [[Bill MacCormick]], formerly of [[Quiet Sun (band)|Quiet Sun]], on bass. The name is a [[pun]] on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Machine Molle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the French translation of the name of Wyatt&amp;apos;s previous group [[Soft Machine]].

==Career==
[[Matching Mole (album)|Their first, eponymous album]] was released in April 1972, the bulk of which was composed by Wyatt himself, with the exception of &amp;quot;O Caroline&amp;quot; (a Dave Sinclair composition with lyrics by Wyatt about his recent breakup with girlfriend [[Caroline Coon]]) and Phil Miller&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Part Of The Dance&amp;quot;. For their second album, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Matching Mole&amp;apos;s Little Red Record]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, released in November 1972 and produced by [[Robert Fripp]] of [[King Crimson]], Sinclair was replaced by New Zealand-born keyboard player and composer [[Dave MacRae]] who had already played a guest role on the first album. This album was more of a team effort, with Wyatt concentrating on lyrics and vocal melodies and leaving the composing to his bandmates.

Matching Mole disbanded in late September 1972 immediately upon completion of a European tour supporting [[Soft Machine]], with Sinclair and Miller going on to form the more successful [[Hatfield and the North]]. A new lineup - consisting of Wyatt, MacCormick, ex-Curved Air keyboardist [[Francis Monkman]] and jazz saxophonist [[Gary Windo]] - was due to record a third album in 1973.  This was cancelled when Wyatt fell from a window in June 1973, and was paralysed from the waist down, and therefore unable to continue drumming.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;NME Rock &amp;apos;N&amp;apos; Roll Years&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book
