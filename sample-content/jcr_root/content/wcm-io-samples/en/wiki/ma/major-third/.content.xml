In [[classical music]] from [[Western culture]], a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;third&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[musical interval]] encompassing three [[staff position]]s (see [[Interval (music)#Number|Interval number]] for more details), and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;major third&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Audio|Major third on C.mid|Play}}) is a third spanning four [[semitone]]s. Along with the [[minor third]], the major third is one of two commonly occurring thirds. It is qualified as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;major&amp;apos;&amp;apos; because it is the larger of the two: the major third spans four semitones, the [[minor third]] three. For example, the interval from C to E is a major third, as the note E lies four semitones above C, and there are three staff positions from C to E. [[Diminished third|Diminished]] and [[augmented third]]s span the same number of staff positions, but consist of a different number of semitones (two and five).

The major third may be derived from the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] as the interval between the fourth and fifth harmonics.
The [[major scale]] is so named because of the presence of this interval between its [[tonic (music)|tonic]] and [[mediant]] (1st and 3rd) [[scale degrees]].
The [[major chord]] also takes its name from the presence of this interval built on the chord&amp;apos;s [[root (chord)|root]] (provided that the interval of a [[perfect fifth]] from the root is also present or implied).

A major third in [[just intonation]] corresponds to a pitch ratio of 5:4 ({{Audio|Just major third on C.mid|play}}) (fifth harmonic in relation to the fourth) or 386.31 cents; in [[equal temperament]], a major third is equal to four [[semitone]]s, a ratio of 2&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;1/3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;:1 (about 1.2599) or 400 cents, 13.69 [[cent (music)|cent]]s wider than the 5:4 ratio.  The older concept of a [[ditone]] (two 9:8 major seconds) made a dissonantly wide major third with the ratio 81:64 ({{Audio|Pythagorean major third on C.mid|play}}).

A helpful way to recognize a major third is to hum the first two notes of [[Kumbaya]] or of [[When the Saints Go Marching In]].  A descending major third is heard at the starts of [[Goodnight, Ladies]] and [[Swing Low, Sweet Chariot]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In equal temperament three major thirds in a row are equal to an octave (for example, A{{music|flat}} to C, C to E, and E to G{{music|sharp}}; G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|flat}} represent the same note). This is sometimes called the &amp;quot;[[augmented chord|circle of thirds]]&amp;quot;. In just intonation, however, three 5:4 major thirds are less than an octave. For example, three 5:4 major thirds from C is B{{music|sharp}} (C to E to G{{music|sharp}} to B{{music|sharp}}). The difference between this just-tuned B{{music|sharp}} and C, like that between G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|flat}}, is called a [[diesis]], about 41 cents.

The major third is classed as an [[consonance and dissonance|imperfect consonance]] and is considered one of the most consonant intervals after the [[unison]], [[octave]], [[perfect fifth]], and [[perfect fourth]]. In the [[common practice period]], thirds were considered interesting and dynamic consonances along with their inverses the sixths, but in [[medieval music|medieval times]] they were considered dissonances unusable in a stable final sonority.

A [[diminished fourth]] is [[enharmonic]]ally equivalent to a major third (that is, it spans the same number of semitones). For example, B–D{{music|sharp}} is a major third; but if the same pitches are spelled B and E{{music|flat}}, the interval is instead a diminished fourth. B–E{{music|flat}} occurs in the C [[harmonic minor scale]].

The major third is used in [[guitar tunings]]. For the [[guitar_tunings#Standard|standard tuning]], only the interval between the 3rd and 2nd strings (G to B, respectively) is a major&amp;amp;nbsp;third; each of the intervals between the other pairs of consecutive strings is a  [[perfect&amp;amp;nbsp;fourth]]. In an [[guitar_tunings#Alternative|alternative tuning]],  the [[major-thirds tuning]], each of the intervals are major thirds.
