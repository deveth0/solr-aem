&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;La Magdalena Contreras&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of the 16 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;delegaciones&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (boroughs) into which [[Mexico]]&amp;apos;s [[Mexican Federal District|Federal District]] is divided. It had a 2010 census population of 239,086 inhabitants, and is the third-least populous of [[Mexico City&amp;apos;s boroughs]]. It lies at an elevation of 2,365 m. above sea level.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://mapserver.inegi.org.mx/mgn2k/?s=geo&amp;amp;c=1223 2010 census tables: INEGI]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The 1847 [[Battle of Padierna]] (aka Battle of Contreras) was fought here. Many people believe that is why the borough is named &amp;quot;La Magdalena Contreras.&amp;quot; It is believed to also be a very poor borough. The people there have up to about 18 square feet of green space and only about 55% keep going to school after the age of  15. The reason very few kids go to school after the age of 15 is they usually stay home and help their parents with any household work that is needed. This is a good example of spatial inequality.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;spatial inequality&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Climate ==

The lower elevations up to 2,900 masl have a mild climate with a median temperature around 15.5°C (60°F) and high rainfall averaging 959 mm (37.7 inches) annually.  Higher regions, for instance Los Dinamos National Park, covered with pine-oak forests, between 2,900 and 3,500 meters are cooler and wetter, averaging near 13°C (55°F) and rainfall (which during rare winter wet days might fall as snow) reaches above 1,100 mm (45 in). At even higher elevations (around 3,700 meters) the weather is rather constantly cold, averaging only 8°C (46°F) and the greatest rainfall of the borough.  The following chart explains the climate of Presa Anzaldo in the urbanized region of Magdalena Contreras, the lowest and warmest of it. The chart below is illustrative of the cooler higher portions, in this example at Monte Alegre.
