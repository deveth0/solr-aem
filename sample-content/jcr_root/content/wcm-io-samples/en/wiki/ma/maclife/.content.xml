&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mac|Life&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an American monthly magazine published by [[Future US]]. It focuses on the [[Macintosh]] personal computer and related products, including the [[iPod]] and [[iPhone]]. Between September 1996 and February 2007, the magazine was known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;MacAddict&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ISSN 1088-548X). In Germany, Mac|Life is published by &amp;quot;Falkemedia&amp;quot; from Kiel (ISSN 1860-9988).

==History==
[[Image:MacAddict Jan01.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of the January 2001 issue of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;MacAddict&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Issue #53)]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mac|Life&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of two successor magazines to the defunct &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[CD-ROM Today]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. First published in 1993 by Imagine Publishing (now [[Future US]]), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;CD-ROM Today&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was targeted at both [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Macintosh]] users, and each issue shipped with a [[CD-ROM]] of [[shareware]] and [[game demo|demo]] programs. In August 1996, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;CD-ROM Today&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ceased publication, with two magazines taking its place: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;MacAddict&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for Macintosh users, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;boot&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (now &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Maximum PC]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) for Windows users.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_March_11/ai_18079665 |title=Good News for Macintosh Consumers: Imagine Publishing Announces its second phase in the evolution of CD-ROM Today |accessdate=2008-04-04 |date=1996-03-11 |work=Business Wire}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

As was the case with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;CD-ROM Today&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;MacAddict&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s discs included shareware and demo programs, but also came with other added features, such as staff videos and previews of content inside the magazine&amp;apos;s hard copy. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;MacAddict&amp;apos;&amp;apos; website was updated daily with news relevant to [[Apple Computer|Apple]] products. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;MacAddict&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also had a mascot, a stick-figure named Max. By 1998, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;MacAddict&amp;apos;&amp;apos; surpassed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Macworld]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as the Macintosh magazine with the highest circulation.&amp;lt;Ref&amp;gt;http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MacAddict+Magazine+Surpasses+Macworld+Magazine+in+Consumer+Newsstand...-a053162240&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In February 2007, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;MacAddict&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was relaunched as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;MacLife&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=MacAddict Rep Discusses New Magazine|url=http://www.macobserver.com/article/2006/10/09.8.shtml|author=Brad Cook|date=2006-10-09|accessdate=2006-10-10|publisher=MacObserver}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=MacAddict to rebrand as MacLife|url= http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/10/06/macaddict/index.php|accessdate=2006-10-23|publisher=Macworld|author=Peter Cohen|date=2006-10-06}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The new magazine is physically larger than the old magazine and was focused on the creativity of Mac users, and no longer comes with a CD-ROM.

Current editorial line-up for the magazine and website include: Jon Phillips, editorial director; Robin Dick, art director;  Susie Ochs, senior editor; Nic Vargus, associate editor; and Florence Ion, online editor.

==Reviewing System==
From 1996 to mid-2002, there were four rating icons, which depicted Max. There was &amp;quot;Blech&amp;quot; (the lowest), &amp;quot;Yeah, Whatever&amp;quot; (a mediocre product), &amp;quot;Spiffy&amp;quot; (a solid yet not perfect product), and &amp;quot;Freakin&amp;apos; Awesome&amp;quot; (the highest). From 2002 to 2009, it was replaced by a more conventional five-point system. Then, in 2010, Mac|Life created a 10 point system that included half stars.
