&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Material&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is anything made of [[matter]], constituted of one or more [[Chemical substance|substance]]s. Wood, cement, hydrogen, air, water and any other matter are all examples of materials. Sometimes the term &amp;quot;material&amp;quot; is used more narrowly to refer to substances or components with certain physical properties that are used as inputs to [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] or [[manufacturing]]. In this sense, materials are the parts required to make something else, from [[building]]s and [[Art medium|art]] to [[Airplane|airplanes]] and [[computer]]s.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Material&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is also used to refer to a group of ideas, facts, information or data, that may provide the basis for or are part of some piece of work.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/material&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Raw materials and processing==
A material can be anything: a finished product in its own right or an unprocessed [[raw material]]. Raw materials are first harvested from the source and divided into a form that can be easily transported and stored, then processed to produce semi-finished materials. These can be input into a new cycle of production and [[Finishing (disambiguation)|finishing]] processes to create finished materials, ready for [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], [[construction]], and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].

==Some examples of raw materials==
;Cotton
An example of a raw material is [[cotton]], which is harvested from plants. Cotton can be processed into rope (also considered a raw material), which can then be woven into [[Textile|cloth]], a semi-finished material. Cutting and sewing the fabric turns it into a [[Clothing|garment]], which is a finished product.

;Steel
[[Steel-making]] is another example â€“ raw materials in the form of [[ore]] are mined, refined and processed into [[steel]], a semi-finished material. Steel is then used as an input in many other industries to make finished products.
