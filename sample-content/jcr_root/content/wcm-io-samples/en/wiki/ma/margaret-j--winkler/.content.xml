{{Refimprove|date=September 2012}}

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Margaret J. Winkler, Mrs. Mintz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 22, 1895 â€“ June 21, 1990) was a key figure in [[Animation Before Hollywood: The Silent Period|silent animation history]], having a crucial role to play in the histories of [[Max Fleischer|Max]] and [[Dave Fleischer]], [[Pat Sullivan (film producer)|Pat Sullivan]], [[Otto Messmer]], and [[Walt Disney]]. She was the first woman to produce and distribute animated films. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born Winkler began her career as personal secretary of [[Harry Warner]], one of the founders of [[Warner Brothers]]. Through most of the silent era, Warner Brothers was strictly a film distributor, and Harry Warner was the man who made the deals. In 1917, Warner Brothers began distributing cartoons of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Mutt and Jeff (comic strip)#Animation|Mutt and Jeff]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. Warner was impressed with Winkler&amp;apos;s talents, and when Max and Dave Fleischer, owners of [[Fleischer Studios]], came to him with their series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Out of the Inkwell]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, he gave it to Winkler and encouraged her to form her own distribution company, Winkler Productions, on a state&amp;apos;s rights basis.

In 1922, she signed a contract with [[Pat Sullivan (film producer)|Pat Sullivan Productions]] to produce &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Felix the Cat]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; cartoons.  This act cemented her reputation as the top distributor in the cartoon world.  It was a good thing, because at the end of that same year the Fleischer brothers, flushed with success from Winkler&amp;apos;s work, left her to form their own distribution company, [[Red Seal Pictures]]. However much he helped her business, Sullivan and Winkler were constantly fighting. In September 1923, the renewal of his contract came up, and his unrealistic demands meant for a while that Winkler Pictures might have to survive without its biggest star. She was open to viewing a pilot reel submitted by then neophyte animator [[Walt Disney]], called &amp;quot;[[Alice&amp;apos;s Wonderland]]&amp;quot;, which was the first entry in the &amp;quot;[[Alice Comedies]]&amp;quot; series. Winkler was intrigued with the idea of a live-action girl in a cartoon world, and signed Disney to a year-long contract despite the fact that the studio that made the cartoon was now bankrupt. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In any case, Disney formed a new studio, Disney Brothers, which was the first cartoon studio in [[Hollywood]] and soon to change its name to [[The Walt Disney Company]] on October 16,  1923. Disney was helped by the tutelage of Winkler, who insisted on editing all of the &amp;quot;Alice Comedies&amp;quot; episodes herself. One of her suggestions was the addition of a suspiciously      Felix-like character called Julius. This was apparently the &amp;quot;straw that broke the camel&amp;apos;s back&amp;quot; for Sullivan, who signed with rival distributor [[E. W. Hammons]] of  [[Educational Pictures]] in 1925.

==Marriage==
In 1924, she married [[Charles B. Mintz]], a film distributor who had been working for her since 1922. Soon after she had her first child and retired from the business, turning her company over to her husband. The couple had two children, Katherine and William. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;U.S. Government Census, 1930&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Death==
Margaret W. Mintz died, aged 95, on June 21, 1990, in [[Mamaroneck, New York]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-24/news/mn-1009_1_margaret-winkler-mintz Margaret Winkler obituary], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;L.A. Times&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. June 24, 1990&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
