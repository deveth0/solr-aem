&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ar|ماروس}}) was a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] village 7&amp;amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Safad]] in the [[District of Safad]], that was captured by [[Israel]] during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli war]] during the Israeli military operation [[Operation Hiram]] by the Israeli attacking brigade [[Sheva&amp;apos; Brigade]].

==History==
Kfar Meroth archaeological site 1st century BCE to 12th century CE synagogue and oldest known &amp;apos;&amp;apos;beit midrash&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (study hall) in Israel {{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In 1596, Marus  was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], a village in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[nahiya]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (subdistrict) of [[Jira]] under the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Liwa (Arabic)|liwa&amp;apos;]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;district&amp;quot;) of [[Safad]], with a population of 176. It paid taxes on a number of crops, including [[wheat]], [[barley]], and fruits as well as on goats.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Hütteroth, Wolf-Dieter and Kamal Abdulfattah (1977), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband 5. Erlangen, Germany: Vorstand der Fränkischen Geographischen Gesellschaft. p. 178. Quoted in Khalidi (1992), p. 475&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the [[British mandate of Palestine|British mandate]] period the village was classified  as a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] by the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Palestine Index Gazetteer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and its entire population was [[Muslim]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Khalidi, 1992, p. 475&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1944/45, the village had a population of 80, and it cultivated a total of 903 [[dunum]]s  with  [[cereal]]s, while 108 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Khalidi, 1992, p. 475, 476&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

===1948, and after===
The village  was captured by [[Israel]] during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli war]] during the Israeli military operation [[Operation Hiram]].

According to the Palestinian historian [[Walid Khalidi]], describing the  village land in 1992: &amp;quot;The site contains some olive and fig trees as well as stones from ruined homes. The surrounding land is used for grazing.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Khalidi, 1992, p. 476&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
