&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Malum in se&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (plural &amp;apos;&amp;apos;mala in se&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[list of Latin phrases|Latin phrase]] meaning &amp;apos;&amp;apos;wrong&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;evil in itself&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  The phrase is used to refer to conduct assessed as sinful or inherently wrong by nature, independent of regulations governing the conduct.  It is distinguished from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[malum prohibitum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which is wrong only because it is prohibited.

For example, most human beings believe that murder, rape, and theft are wrong, regardless of whether a law governs such conduct or where the conduct occurs, and is thus recognizably &amp;apos;&amp;apos;malum in se&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In contrast, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;malum prohibitum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; crimes are criminal not because they are inherently bad, but because the act is prohibited by the law of the state.

This concept was used to develop the various [[common law offences]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Canadian Law Dictionary, John A. Yogis, Q.C., Barrons: 2003&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Another way to describe the underlying conceptual difference between &amp;quot;malum in se&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;malum prohibitum&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;iussum quia iustum&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;iustum quia iussum,&amp;quot; namely something that is commanded (iussum) because it is just (iustum) and something that is just (iustum) because it is commanded (iussum).
