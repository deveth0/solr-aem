Taft&amp;apos;s administration, the federal government moved to strengthen its regulatory control over the railroad industry by the passage of the Mann–Elkins Act.

Supported by [[President]] [[William Howard Taft]], the law also expanded on the powers granted to the ICC in the 1906 [[Hepburn Act]]. The ICC was authorized to investigate proposed railroad rate increases and suspend them if warranted. The &amp;quot;long-and-short haul&amp;quot; clause of the original [[Interstate Commerce Act]] (1887) was strengthened to prohibit railroads from charging passengers more for a short distance trip, compared to a longer distance ride, over the same route, unless specifically approved by the ICC.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Sharfman&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;{{rp|217-219}}

The Act also created the short-lived [[United States Commerce Court]] for adjudication of railway disputes.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Sharfman&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;{{rp|216}} The Court presided until 1913, when it was abolished by [[United States Congress|Congress]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Urgent Deficiency Act, [[63rd United States Congress|63rd Congress]], 1st session, ch. 32, {{USStat|38|208}}, October 22, 1913.
