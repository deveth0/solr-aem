&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Madras&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a lightweight cotton [[fabric]] with typically patterned texture and plaid design, used primarily for summer clothing such as pants, shorts, dresses, and jackets. The fabric takes its name from the former name of the city of [[Chennai]], [[India]]. This cloth also was identified by the colloquial name, &amp;quot;Madrasi checks.&amp;quot;

Madras today is available as plaid patterns in regular cotton, [[seersucker]] and as patchwork madras. Patchwork madras is fabric that is derived from cutting several madras plaid fabrics into strips, and sewing them back together as squares of 3 inch sizes, that form a mixed pattern of various plaids crisscrossing. As a fabric, it is notable because the front and back of the fabric are indistinguishable.

One style popular during the 1960s was called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;bleeding Madras&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It used [[dye]]s that were not [[colorfast]] in a typically [[Tartan|plaid]] design, resulting in bleeding and fading colors that yielded a new look to the fabric each time it was laundered.

In contemporary fashion, it is used for men&amp;apos;s shirts, women&amp;apos;s skirts and pants, golf apparel, children&amp;apos;s wear and for accessories.

==In popular culture==
The fabric is mentioned many times in the [[S.E. Hinton]] book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as a favored pattern of shirts and jackets  worn by the Socs. The book is set in the early 1960s, a period when Madras was particularly fashionable amongst [[preps]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.1960sclothing.co.uk/the-1960s/1960s-america/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
