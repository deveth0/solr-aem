The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mannegishi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (singular the same) are a race of [[trickster]] people in [[Cree]] [[folklore]], similar in nature to the [[Memegwesi]] of the [[Ojibwa]]. They are described as semi-humanoid, being [[sexdactylous]] humans with very thin and lanky arms and legs and big heads minus a nose. According to one Cree schema of the mythology, there are two humanoid races, one being the familiar [[human]] species and the other being the &amp;quot;little people&amp;quot;, i.e. Mannegishi. These people are said to live between rocks in the rapids. One of their biggest delights -- a completely non-heroic form of trickster behavior -- is to crawl out of the rocks and capsize the canoes of people canoeing through the rapids, spinning them to their death.

The Mannegishi has attracted interest in recent years due to its possible [[cryptozoology|cryptozoological]] connections. It is believed by some that the [[Dover Demon]] represents a modern sighting of the Mannegishi.
