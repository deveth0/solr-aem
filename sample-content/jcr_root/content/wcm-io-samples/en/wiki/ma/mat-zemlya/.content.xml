&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mat Zemlya&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Matka Ziemia,&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mati Syra Zemlya&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (literally &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Damp Mother Earth&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;),  is the oldest deity in [[Slavic mythology]], her identity later blended into that of [[Mokosh]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[Encyclopedia Mythica by John McCannon]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; She shares characteristics with [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|Indo-Iranian]] Ardvi Sura [[Anahita]] “Humid Mother of the Earth.”

In the early [[Middle Ages]], Mati Syra Zemlya was one of the most important [[deities]] in the Slavic world. Oaths were made binding by touching the Earth and sins were confessed into a hole in the Earth before death. She was worshipped in her natural form and was not given a human personage or likeness. Since the adoption of [[Christianity]] in all Slavic lands, she has been identified with [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], the mother of Jesus.

An example of her importance is seen in this traditional invocation to Matka Ziema, made with a jar of [[hemp oil]]:

East &amp;amp;ndash; &amp;quot;Mother Earth, subdue every evil and unclean being so that he may not cast a spell on us nor do us any harm.&amp;quot; West &amp;amp;ndash; &amp;quot;Mother Earth, engulf the unclean power in thy boiling pits, and in thy burning fires.&amp;quot; South &amp;amp;ndash; &amp;quot;Mother Earth, calm the winds coming from the South and all bad weather. Calm the moving sands and whirlwinds.&amp;quot; North &amp;amp;ndash; &amp;quot;Mother Earth, calm the North winds and clouds, subdue the snowstorms and the cold.&amp;quot; The jar, which held the oil, is buried after each invocation and offering is made at each Quarter. (Slavonic mythology 1977:287)
