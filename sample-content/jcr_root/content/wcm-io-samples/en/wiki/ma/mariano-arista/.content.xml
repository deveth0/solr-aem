&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;José Mariano Martín Buenaventura Ignacio Nepomuceno García de Arista Nuez&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (26 July 1802 – 7 August 1855) was a noted veteran of many of [[Mexico]]&amp;apos;s nineteenth-century wars who served as [[president of Mexico]] from 15 January 1851 to 6 January 1853.

He was born in the state of [[San Luis Potosí]]. Originally an officer in the Spanish Army, Arista later joined the revolutionary army of [[Agustín de Iturbide]]. Later, he served under [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], Mexico&amp;apos;s on-again/off-again dictator during the attempt to put down the 1836 [[Texas Revolution]].

In 1846, Arista was given command of the Army of the North and sent to expel American troops from Mexican territory in Texas. The resulting engagement ignited the bloody [[Mexican-American War]] of 1846–1848. Arista was in command of Mexican forces during the [[Battle of Palo Alto]] and the [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma]].

Personally quite brave, Arista was a dedicated republican – a member of Mexico&amp;apos;s liberal faction, and therefore the natural enemy of his largely conservative general staff. At both the Battles of [[Battle of Palo Alto|Palo Alto]] and [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma|Resaca de la Palma]], Arista was ill served by the political division among his staff.

After Resaca de la Palma, Mexico&amp;apos;s government recalled Arista, and he was removed from command. Later absolved of guilt for the defeats at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma, Arista spent the rest of the war as a functionary, seeing little combat.

In 1851, Arista succeeded [[José Joaquín de Herrera]] as president and sought to bring fiscal stability to the nation. Conservative resistance to Arista&amp;apos;s rule and an eventual revolt by the said conservatives led to his resignation and exile in 1853.

He died on board the English steamer &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tagus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; while traveling from [[Lisbon, Portugal]], to [[France]] on 7 August 1855. In 1880 his remains were returned to Mexico, where the Liberal faction named him a national hero.
