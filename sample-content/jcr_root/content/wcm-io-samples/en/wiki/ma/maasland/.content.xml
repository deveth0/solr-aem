        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Maasland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (population: 6,844) is a town in the western [[Netherlands]], in the province of [[South Holland]]. It lies in the municipality of [[Midden-Delfland]] and covers an area of 24.42&amp;amp;nbsp;km² (of which 0.64&amp;amp;nbsp;km² water).

Maasland was a separate municipality until 2004, when it became part of Midden-Delfland.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Repertorium Nederlandse Gemeenten}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The first signs of a community started back in 925 when the area became part of the county of Graaf Dirk II and a church was built. After severe floodings during the 12th century, the Maasdijk was rebuilt and the town centre has been relocated to where it still is. In 1241 the German Teutonic Knights drew on the territory of Maasland.

In 1450 the &amp;apos;Poldermolen&amp;apos; (translation: Poldermill) was built in Maasland (see picture).

During the war between Spain and the Netherlands a huge area of the Netherlands was flooded which was part of the strategy of Willem van Oranje. In 1574, these floodings affected Maasland, and once again the town was flooded. It took a couple of years before the town was rebuilt and in 1614 part of the town Maasland (which included the Maeslandsluys) gained independency and is known as Maassluis.

Until the new townhall was built in 1874 meetings of the city council meetings were held in the tavern &amp;apos;de Pynas&amp;apos;.
