&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Magdalena of Saxony&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (7 March 1507 – 25 January 1534) was Margravine of Brandenburg, its &amp;quot;Electoral Princess&amp;quot;, the Electoral equivalent of a crown princess.

She was the daughter of [[George, Duke of Saxony|George &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the Bearded&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Duke of Saxony]] and his wife [[Barbara Jagiellon|Barbara]]. Magdalena&amp;apos;s maternal grandparents were [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon]] and his wife queen [[Elisabeth of Austria (1436–1505)|Elisabeth of Austria]], daughter of [[Albert II of Germany]].

She was a granddaughter of the Elisabeth aforementioned,mother of the [[Jagiellonians]], queen of Poland, who had claimed the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]] in 1460s as being the younger daughter of the last Luxembourg heiress [[Elisabeth of Luxembourg, Queen of Bohemia]]. Though by no means an heiress of her grandmother, she was intended to wed the heir of her grandmother&amp;apos;s older sister. Joachim (1505–1571), the future elector of Brandenburg, was the eldest son and heir of their current claimant of Luxembourg, [[Joachim I, Elector of Brandenburg]] (1484–1535), the eldest son and heir of the late [[Margaret of Thuringia]] (1449–1501), Dowager Electress of Brandenburg, herself the eldest daughter and heiress of [[Anna, Duchess of Luxembourg]] and [[William of Saxony, Landgrave of Thuringia]].

Magdalena was thus married, at [[Dresden]], on 6 November 1524, to her second cousin&amp;apos;s son [[Joachim II of Brandenburg|Joachim]] Hector, the future Elector of Brandenburg. Their son was [[John George, Elector of Brandenburg|John George]], another future Elector of Brandenburg. After Magdalena&amp;apos;s death which occurred well before Joachim ascended the electorate, Joachim II Hector married [[Hedwig Jagiellon (1513–1573)|Hedwig Jagiellon]], daughter of King [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I of Poland]].
