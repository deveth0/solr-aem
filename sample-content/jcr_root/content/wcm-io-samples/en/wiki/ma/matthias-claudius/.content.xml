[[File:Portrait claudius.jpg|thumb|right|Matthias Claudius]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Matthias Claudius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (August 15, 1740 – January 21, 1815) was a [[Germany|German]] poet, otherwise known by the penname of “Asmus”.

==Life==

Claudius was born at [[Reinfeld, Holstein|Reinfeld]], near [[Lübeck]], and studied at [[Jena]]. He spent the greater part of his life in the little town of [[Wandsbek (quarter)|Wandsbeck]], where he earned his first literary reputation by editing from 1771 to 1775, a newspaper called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Der Wandsbecker Bothe&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (The Wandsbeck Messenger) (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wandsbeck&amp;apos;&amp;apos; until the year 1879 still written with &amp;quot;ck&amp;quot;. Today only with &amp;quot;k&amp;quot;.), in which he published a large number of prose essays and poems. They were written in pure and simple German, and appealed to the popular taste; in many there was a vein of extravagant humour or even burlesque, while others were full of quiet meditation and solemn sentiment. In his later days, perhaps through the influence of [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock|Klopstock]], with whom he had formed an intimate acquaintance, Claudius became strongly pietistic, and the graver side of his nature showed itself. In 1814 he moved to [[Hamburg]], to the house of his son-in-law, the publisher [[Friedrich Christoph Perthes]], where he died on January 21, 1815.

==Works==

Claudius&amp;apos;s poem &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Death and the Maiden&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was used by composer [[Franz Schubert]] in 1817 for one of his most celebrated [[Death and the Maiden (song)|songs]], which in turn became the basis for the 1824 [[Death and the Maiden Quartet (Schubert)|string quartet]] of the same name.

Claudius&amp;apos;s collected works were published under the title of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Asmus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; omnia sua secum portans, oder Sämtliche Werke des Wandsbecker Boten&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (8 vols., 1775–1812; 13th edition, by C. Redich, 2 vols., 1902). His biography has been written by Wilhelm Herbst (4th ed., 1878). See also M. Schneidereit, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;M. Claudius, seine Weltanschauung und Lebensweisheit&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1898).
