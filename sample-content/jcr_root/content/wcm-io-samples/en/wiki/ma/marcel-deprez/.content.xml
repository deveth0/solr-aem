&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marcel Deprez&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (December 12, 1843 – October 13, 1918) was a [[France|French]] [[electrical engineer]]. He was born in [[Aillant-sur-Milleron]]. He died in [[Vincennes]].

==Biography==
Deprez was born in [[Aillant-sur-Milleron]] in rural France and attended the School of Mines in Paris. He was not able to complete the course but he must have made a good impression as he was employed as a secretary to the Director of the school, [[Charles Combes]].&amp;lt;ref name=walters&amp;gt;[http://www.archivingindustry.com/Indicator/chaptereight.pdf The Engine Indicator], John Walters, Chapter 8, p.8-20&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

At [[Creil]], from 1876 to 1886, Deprez conducted the first experiments to transmit [[electric power|electrical power]] over long distances. At the [[International Exposition of Electricity, Paris]] in 1881, Deprez undertook the task of presenting an [[electricity distribution]] system based on the long-distance transmission of [[direct current]]. The first successful attempt took place in 1882 from [[Miesbach]] to [[Munich]] at the occasion of the Exposition of Electricity in the Glaspalast organised by [[Oskar von Miller]].  There he transmitted 1.5&amp;amp;nbsp;kW at 2kV over a distance of 35 miles.&amp;lt;ref name=arrillaga&amp;gt;{{cite book |page=page 1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I2mdgdflTQUC&amp;amp;pg=PA1|title=High Voltage Direct Current Transmission|isbn=978-0-85296-941-0|year=1998|publisher=Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)|author=Jos Arrillaga|accessdate=2009-01-06}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Deprez conducted experiments in La Chapelle, Grenoble, Vizille, Paris, and Creil.  He eventually attained [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] over thirty-five miles for industrial purposes.  In 1889, [[Rene Thury]] continued his approach of arranging generators in series, eventually developing commercial systems delivering 20 Megawatts at 125kV over 230 kilometers.&amp;lt;ref name=arrillaga/&amp;gt;
