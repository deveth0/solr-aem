[[The Honourable]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mabel Edeline Strickland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (8 January 1899 – 29 November 1988), was an [[England|Anglo]]-[[Malta|Maltese]] journalist, newspaper proprietor and politician.

Strickland was the daughter of [[Gerald Strickland, 1st Baron Strickland|Sir Gerald Strickland]] (later Lord Strickland), [[Prime Minister of Malta]], by Lady Edeline Sackville, eldest daughter of [[Reginald Sackville, 7th Earl De La Warr]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p47079.htm#i470784 thepeerage.com Hon. Mabel Edeline Strickland]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Strickland founded a newspaper group in Malta with her father and her stepmother, Lady Strickland (née Hulton). In 1935 she became editor of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Times of Malta]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;quot;Il Berqa&amp;quot; before taking over as Managing Director of the Group on the death of her father in 1940. The paper never missed an issue throughout the Siege of Malta in World War Two, despite taking direct hits on several occasions. She formed and led the Progressive Constitutional Party during the 1950s and was one of the principal political leaders of the 1950s, participating in the integration talks in 1956-57 as well as opposing independence in 1964. She was elected to the Maltese Parliament again in 1962. She always fought passionately for a free and independent press and to maintain Malta&amp;apos;s ties with Britain and the Commonwealth.

Mabel Strickland was affectionately known in her time as both &amp;quot;Miss Mabel&amp;quot; and also &amp;quot;The Queen of Malta&amp;quot;. She had a huge, formidable personality, and an infectious sense of humour. Described once as &amp;quot;an active volcano&amp;quot;&amp;apos; she was unquestionably a force to be reckoned with.  With an impressive range of contacts, she was equally at ease with Royalty or Statesmen as she was with her employees or the woman/man in the street.

Having never married or had children of her own, her chosen heir was her great nephew Robert Hornyold-Strickland.  Mabel died on 29 November 1988 and is buried in the family crypt in the Cathedral in Mdina. Her tombstone lies near that of her father who was the principal influence in her life.
