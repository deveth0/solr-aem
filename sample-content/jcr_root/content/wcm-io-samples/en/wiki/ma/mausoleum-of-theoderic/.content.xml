The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mausoleum of Theoderic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Italian language|Italian]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mausoleo di Teoderico&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is an ancient monument just outside [[Ravenna]], [[Italy]]. It was built in 520 AD by [[Theoderic the Great]] as his future tomb.

==Description==
The current structure of the mausoleum is divided into two [[Decagon|decagonal]] orders, one above the other; both are made of [[Istria]] stone. Its roof is a single 300–ton [[Istrian stone]], 10 meters in diameter. A niche leads down to a room that was probably a chapel for funeral [[Liturgy|liturgies]]; a stair leads to the upper floor. Located in the centre of the floor is a circular [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] stone grave, in which Theoderic was  buried. His remains were removed during [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule, when the [[mausoleum]] was turned into a [[Christian]]  [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]]. In the late 19th century, silting from a nearby rivulet that had partly submerged the mausoleum was drained and excavated.

It was inscribed with seven other &amp;quot;Early Christian Monuments and Mosaics of Ravenna&amp;quot; buildings as one of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] in 1996. According to the [[ICOMOS]] evaluation, &amp;quot;the significance of the mausoleum lies in its Gothic style and decoration, which owe nothing to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] or Byzantine art, although it makes use of the Roman stone construction technique of [[opus quadratum]], which had been abandoned four centuries before&amp;quot; and in the fact that &amp;quot;it is the only surviving example of a tomb of a king of this period.&amp;quot;

An approximate replica of this tomb was constructed in the USA in 1925 when the Taplin Gorge Dam was constructed north of [[Fergus Falls]], Minnesota. The designer (Vernon Wright who was also the president of the dam&amp;apos;s owner - the [[Otter Tail Power Company]]) based the design of the [[Power station|powerhouse]] on this mausoleum.
