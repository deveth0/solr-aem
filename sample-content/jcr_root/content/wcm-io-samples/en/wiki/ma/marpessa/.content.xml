In [[Greek mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marpessa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-grc|Μάρπησσα|Márpessa}}, ‘the robbed one’) was an [[Aetolia]]n princess, and a granddaughter of [[Ares]]. According to another myth, she was the daughter of [[Evenus (mythology)|Evenus]] and [[Alcippe (Greek mythology)|Alcippe]]. She loved [[Idas]] and was loved by him in return. She was also loved by the god [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]].

When Idas asked to marry Marpessa, Evenus refused his request. Idas went to [[Poseidon]] and begged for the use of a winged [[chariot]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Jeanie Lang]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Book of Myths&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p. 90-99.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Poseidon consented to his use of the chariot, and Idas stole Marpessa away and fled. Her father, after chasing the couple for a long time and realizing he could not catch up to them, killed his horses and then drowned himself in a nearby river, which took his name.

Apollo also pursued them in his own chariot, wanting Marpessa for himself. Eventually [[Zeus]] intervened and commanded Marpessa to choose between her mortal lover and the god.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Jeanie Lang]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Book of Myths&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p. 90-99.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Marpessa chose Idas, reasoning to Apollo that had she chosen the god, she would have eventually grown old and lost his affections:

:&amp;quot;And thou beautiful god, in that far time,
:When in thy setting sweet thou gazest down
:On this grey head, wilt thou remember then
:That once I pleased thee, that I once was young?&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Stephen Phillips]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marpessa (poem)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Marpessa is also the name of an [[Amazons|Amazon]] Queen.

Marpessa and her story are quoted in several ancient sources, among them:

*[[Homer]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Iliad]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 9.556; 8th century B.C.;
*[[Propertius]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Elegies&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1.2; 1st century B.C.;
*[[Plutarch]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Parallel Lives]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 40; 1st-2nd century A.D.;
*Pseudo-Appollodorus, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Library]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1.7.8-9, 1.60; 2nd century A.D.

== Modern use of the name ==
It is thought that the modern and rare Italian female personal name [[Marfisa]] and the variants Marfisia and Marfisio (male version) descend from Marpessa.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} This is probably supported by the history of the evolution of the name itself.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marpessa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as a name, was used to describe a 206,000 ton [[Shell Oil]] company [[supertanker]] ([[VLCC]]). In December 1969, it became the world&amp;apos;s largest oil tanker to sink up to that date. Marpessa had been on its maiden voyage from [[Europoort|Europort]], [[Rotterdam]], when an explosion ripped through the hull and it foundered 50 miles off the west coast of [[Africa]].
