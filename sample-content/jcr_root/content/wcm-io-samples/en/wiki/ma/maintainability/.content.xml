In [[engineering]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;maintainability&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the ease with which a product can be maintained in order to:
* isolate defects or their cause,
* correct defects or their cause,
* repair or replace faulty or worn-out components without having to replace still-working parts,
* prevent unexpected breakdowns,
* maximize a product&amp;apos;s useful life,
* maximize efficiency, reliability, and safety,
* meet new [[requirements]],
* make future maintenance easier, or
* cope with a changed environment.

In some cases, maintainability involves a system of [[continuous improvement]] - learning from the past in order to improve the ability to maintain systems, or improve reliability of systems based on maintenance experience.

In [[telecommunication]] and several other engineering fields, the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;maintainability&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has the following meanings:

* A characteristic of design and installation, expressed as the probability that an item will be retained in or restored to a specified condition within a given period of [[time]], when the [[repair and maintenance|maintenance]] is performed in accordance with prescribed procedures and resources.
* The ease with which maintenance of a [[functional unit]] can be performed in accordance with prescribed requirements.

== Software engineering ==
In [[software engineering]], these activities are known as [[software maintenance]] (cf. [[ISO/IEC 9126]]).

The maintainability index is calculated with certain formulae from [[Lines of code|lines-of-code measures]], [[McCabe Measure|McCabe measures]] and [[Halstead complexity measures]].

The measurement and track maintainability are intended to help reduce or reverse a system&amp;apos;s tendency toward &amp;quot;code entropy&amp;quot; or degraded integrity, and to indicate when it becomes cheaper and/or less risky to rewrite the code than it is to change it.
