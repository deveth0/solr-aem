[[File:Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|220px|thumb|right|&amp;quot;It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;- [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Prince]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]]

In [[cognitive science]] and [[evolutionary psychology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Machiavellian intelligence&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;political intelligence&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;social intelligence&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is the capacity of an entity to be in a successful [[political science|political]] engagement with [[social group]]s. The first introduction of this concept to [[primatology]] came from [[Frans de Waal]]&amp;apos;s book &amp;quot;Chimpanzee Politics&amp;quot; (1982), which described social maneuvering while explicitly quoting [[Machiavelli]]. Also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;machiavellianism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, it is the art of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] in which others are socially manipulated in a way that benefits the user, whether it is to the detriment of the people being used. The user would feel little to no remorse or empathy when their actions harm others.

==History==
The term refers to [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Prince]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1513) and to the hypothesis that the techniques which lead to certain kinds of political [[wikt:success|success]] within large [[social group]]s are also applicable within smaller groups, including the [[family|family-unit]]. The term &amp;quot;everyday politics&amp;quot; was later introduced in reference to these various methods. These arguments are based on research by primatologists such as [[Nicholas Humphrey]] (1975).

Machiavelli&amp;apos;s teachings continue to influence all levels of Western society. Take for example a situation presented by Michael Walzer{{cn|date=May 2013}}: An elementary school needs a new roof. Simple as it may seem, much of Machiavelli&amp;apos;s theories will be put to use. Money from a budget must be allocated by officials, each of them lobbying for what they think is most important. Even then, if money is allocated towards a new roof, a construction contractor must be hired. One must consistently consider, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;What is behind this lower estimate for the construction work? Why does this company want this small contract?&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Many questions must be asked in order to identify deception. In the end, all anyone can ever do is &amp;quot;strive to make an informed decision based on the best evidence, and then act accordingly, even though the best evidence will never guarantee certainty.&amp;quot;

Machiavellian intelligence may be demonstrated by [[behavior]]s including:
*[[blame|Blaming]] and [[forgiveness]];
*[[lie|Lying]] and [[truth|truth-telling]];
*Making and breaking [[alliance]]s;
*Making and breaking [[promise]]s;
*Making and breaking [[wiktionary:rule|rule]]s;
*[[Misleading]] and [[misdirection]].
