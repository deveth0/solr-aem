She was the sister and wife of [[Inti]], daughter of [[Viracocha]] and mother of [[Manco Cápac]] and [[Mama Ocllo]], mythical founders of the [[Inca]] empire and culture. She was the goddess of [[marriage]] and the menstrual cycle, and considered a defender of women. She was also important for the Inca [[calendar]].

Myths surrounding Mama Quilla include that she cried tears of [[silver]] and that [[lunar eclipses]] were caused when she was being attacked by an animal. She was envisaged in the form of a beautiful woman and her temples were served by dedicated priestesses.

===Myths surrounding Mama Quilla===
One myth surrounding the moon was to account for the &amp;quot;[[Moon#Impact_craters|dark spots]]&amp;quot;; it was believed that a [[fox]] fell in love with Mama Quilla because of her beauty, but when he rose into the sky, she squeezed him against her, producing the patches.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;D&amp;apos;A&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; The Incas would fear [[lunar eclipse]]s as they believed that during the eclipse, an animal (possibly a [[mountain lion]],&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Cobo&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; serpent&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Cobo&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Conway&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; or [[Cougar|puma]]&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Conway&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;) was attacking Mama Quilla. Consequently, people would attempt to scare away the animal by throwing weapons, gesturing and making as much noise as possible. They believed that if the animal achieved its aim, then the world would be left in darkness. This tradition continued after the Incas had been converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] by the [[Conquistadors]], which the Spanish used to their advantage. The natives showed the Spanish great respect when they found that they were able to predict when the eclipses would take place.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Cobo&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Mama Quilla was also believed to cry tears of [[silver]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;D&amp;apos;A&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Relations==
Mama Quilla was generally the third deity in the [[Inca_mythology#Deities|Inca pantheon]], after [[Inti]] (god of the sun) and [[Illapa]] (god of thunder),&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Cobo&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; but was viewed as more important than Inti by some coastal communities, including by the [[Chimú culture|Chimú]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;D&amp;apos;A&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Relatives of Mama Quilla include her husband Inti, god of the sun, and her children [[Manco Cápac]], first ruler of the Incas, and [[Mama Ocllo]], his wife.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Conway&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; After the [[Ichma]], nominally of the [[Chimor|Chimú empire]], joined the Inca empire, she also became the mother of their deity [[Pacha Camac]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title= Peru Before the Incas|last= Lanning|first= Edward|year= 1968|publisher= Prentice Hall|isbn= 978-0-13-661595-8}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Mama Quilla&amp;apos;s mother was said to be [[Viracocha]].

==Symbology and temples==
Mama Quilla had her own temple in [[Cuzco]], served by priestesses dedicated to her.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;D&amp;apos;A&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; She was imagined as a human female,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;D&amp;apos;A&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; and images of her included a silver disc covering an entire wall.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Conway&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
