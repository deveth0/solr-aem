&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Max Black&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (24 February 1909 – 27 August 1988) was a British-American philosopher, who was a leading influential figure in [[analytic philosophy]] in the first half of the twentieth century. He made contributions to the [[philosophy of language]], the [[philosophy of mathematics]] and [[philosophy of science|science]], and the [[philosophy of art]], also publishing studies of the work of philosophers such as [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]. His translation (with [[Peter Geach]]) of Frege&amp;apos;s published philosophical writing is a classic text.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Life and career==
Born in [[Baku]], [[Russian Empire]] [now [[Azerbaijan]]] of [[Jewish]] descent, Black grew up in [[London]], where his family had moved in 1912. He studied mathematics at [[Queens&amp;apos; College, Cambridge]] where he developed an interest in the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[G. E. Moore]], and [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] were all at Cambridge at that time, and their influence on Black may have been considerable. He graduated in 1930 and was awarded a fellowship to study at [[Göttingen]] for a year.

From 1931–36, he was mathematics master at the [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle]].

His first book was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Nature of Mathematics&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1933), an exposition of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Principia Mathematica]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and of current developments in the philosophy of mathematics.

Black had made notable contributions to the metaphysics of [[Identity (philosophy)| identity]]. In his &amp;quot;The Identity of Indiscernibles&amp;quot;, Black presents an objection to [[Identity of indiscernibles| Leibniz&amp;apos; Law]] by means of a hypothetical scenario in which he conceives two distinct spheres having exactly the same properties, thereby contradicting Leibniz&amp;apos; second principle in his formulation of &amp;quot;The Identity of Indescernibles&amp;quot;. By virtue of there being two objects, albeit with identical properties, the existence of two objects, even in a void, denies their identicality.

He lectured in mathematics at the [[Institute of Education]] in London from 1936 to 1940. In 1940 he moved to the [[United States]] and joined Philosophy Department at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. In 1946 he accepted a professorship in philosophy at [[Cornell University]]. In 1948, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1963.&amp;lt;ref name=AAAS&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=[[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Black died in [[Ithaca, New York]] age 79. His younger brother was the architect Sir [[Misha Black]].
