&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Maurice André&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (May 21, 1933{{spaced ndash}}February 25, 2012) was a French [[trumpeter]], active in the [[European classical music|classical music]] field.

==Biography==
André was born in [[Alès]] in the [[Cévennes]], into a mining family. His father was an amateur musician. André studied trumpet with a friend of his father&amp;apos;s, who suggested that André be sent to the [[music school|conservatory]]. In order to gain free admission to the conservatory, he joined a [[military band]]. After only six months at the conservatory, he won his first prize.

At the conservatory, André&amp;apos;s professor beat him out of frustration and told him to return when he could excel in his playing. A few weeks later, he returned to play all fourteen [[Étude|etudes]] found in the back of the [[Jean-Baptiste Arban|Arban]]&amp;apos;s [[Arban method|book]] without a single mistake.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal | author=Steven Chenette | title=&amp;quot;It&amp;apos;s My Greatest Joy&amp;quot; : An Interview with Maurice Andre | journal=International Trumpet Guild Journal| year=2001 | volume=30 | pages=08–19}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Maurice André won the [[Geneva International Music Competition]] in 1955 and the [[ARD International Music Competition]] in [[Munich]] in 1963.  He was made an honorary member of the Delta chapter of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]] at Ithaca College in New York in 1970.

André rose to international prominence in the 1960s and 1970s with a large series of recordings of [[Baroque]] works on [[piccolo trumpet]] for [[Erato Records|Erato]] and other labels. Not content to limit himself to the standard Baroque trumpet repertoire, André also performed many [[transcription (music)|transcriptions]] of works for oboe, flute, and even voice and string instruments.  These recordings were (and remain) very popular, and were a strong component of the rebirth of interest in Baroque music in the 1960s. André had over 300 [[Sound recording|audio]] recordings to his name, from the mid-1950s to his death.

He had three children: Lionel (1959-1988),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trumpetguild.org/pdf/2012journal/AndreLaplaceFr.pdf | title =  Obituary by Michel Laplace| accessdate = 2013-05-09}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; trumpeter and music teacher, Nicolas, who plays the trumpet; and Béatrice, who plays the oboe. All three performed with their father in concert. He also made several recordings with his brother Raymond (b. 1941).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url = http://abel.hive.no/trompet/andre/raymond/ | title = Raymond André | accessdate = 2013-05-09}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

One of André&amp;apos;s students, [[Guy Touvron]] wrote a biography on him entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Maurice André: Une trompette pour la renommée&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Maurice André: A Trumpet for Fame), which was published in 2003.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=q57185|pure_url=yes}} | title = Guy Touvron | work = [[Allmusic]] | last = Cummings | first = Robert  | accessdate = 2010-12-15}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

André spent the last few years of his life in retirement in the southern part of France. He died at the age of 78 in a hospital in [[Bayonne]] on February 25, 2012.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17173246 |title=Trumpet player Maurice Andre dies aged 78 |author=BBC News |date=26 February 2012 |accessdate=26 February 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He is buried in the cemetery of the village of [[Saint-André-Capcèze]] (in the [[Lozère]]).
