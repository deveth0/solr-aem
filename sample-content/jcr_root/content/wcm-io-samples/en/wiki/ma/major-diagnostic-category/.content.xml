        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Major Diagnostic Categories&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (MDC) are formed by dividing all possible principal diagnoses (from [[ICD]]-9-CM) into 25 mutually exclusive diagnosis areas. MDC codes, like [[Diagnosis-related group|DRG]] codes, are primarily a claims and administrative data element unique to the [[United States]] medical care reimbursement system. DRG codes also are mapped, or grouped, into MDC codes.

The diagnoses in each MDC correspond to a single organ system or [[etiology]] and, in general, are associated with a particular medical specialty. MDC 1 to MDC 23 are grouped according to principal diagnoses. Patients are assigned to MDC 24 (Multiple Significant [[Physical trauma|Trauma]]) with at least two significant trauma diagnosis codes (either as principal or secondaries) from different body site categories. Patients assigned to MDC 25 ([[HIV]] Infections) must have a principal diagnosis of an HIV Infection or a principal diagnosis of a significant HIV related condition and a secondary diagnosis of an HIV Infection.

MDC 0, unlike the others, can be reached from a number of diagnosis/procedure situations, all related to transplants. This is due to the expense involved for the transplants so designated and because these transplants can be needed for a number of reasons which do not all come from one diagnosis domain.  DRGs which reach MDC 0 are assigned to the MDC for the principal diagnosis instead of to the MDC associated with the designated DRG.
