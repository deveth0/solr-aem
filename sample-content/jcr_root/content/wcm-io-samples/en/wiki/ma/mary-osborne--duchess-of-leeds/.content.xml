&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mary Osborne, Duchess of Leeds&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1723 - 3 August 1764) (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;nÃ©e&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Lady Mary Godolphin), daughter of [[Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough]] and [[Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin]]. She was a granddaughter of the powerful government trio during the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]: the famous general and politician, [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|John Churchill]], 1st [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|Duke of Marlborough]], and his wife [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough]], through her mother; and [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Sidney Godolphin]], 1st [[Earl of Godolphin]] through her father.

Lady Mary was considered to be the illegitimate child of the famous [[playwright]] [[William Congreve]], who was having a long-term relationship with Henrietta, Duchess of Marlborough. She was, however, recognised by Francis as his own daughter, and was raised by him with the other Godolphin children. Despite this, gossip spread rapidly about Mary&amp;apos;s parentage, and her grandmother [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah, Dowager Duchess of Marlborough]] did not recognise her until 1740, when the two reconciled their differences. It was at this time that Sarah arranged her marriage to [[Thomas Osborne, 4th Duke of Leeds]]; they were married on 26 June 1740. They had one child, [[Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds|Francis Godolphin Osborne]] (styled Marquess of Carmarthen, later 5th [[Duke of Leeds]] and [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]]), who was born on 29 January 1751.

Mary died in 1764, aged 41.
