        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Martha Mitchell effect&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the process by which a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other [[mental health]] clinician mistakes the patient&amp;apos;s perception of real events as [[delusional]] and misdiagnoses accordingly.

==Description==
According to Bell et al., &amp;quot;Sometimes, improbable reports are erroneously assumed to be symptoms of mental illness&amp;quot;, due to a &amp;quot;failure or inability to verify whether the events have actually taken place, no matter how improbable intuitively they might appear to the busy clinician&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=Bell2003&amp;gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bell, V., Halligan, P. W., Ellis, H. D.|date=August 2003|title=Beliefs About Delusions|journal=The Psychologist|volume=16|issue=8|pages=418â€“422|id=JI 0.325|url=http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm?volumeID=16&amp;amp;editionID=97&amp;amp;ArticleID=588}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; They note that typical examples of such situations, may include:
* Pursuit by [[organized crime|organized criminals]]
* [[Surveillance]] by law enforcement officers
* Infidelity by a spouse
* Physical issues

Quoting psychotherapist [[Joseph Berke]], the authors note that &amp;quot;even [[Paranoia|paranoid]]s have enemies&amp;quot;. Any patient, they explain, can be misdiagnosed by clinicians, especially patients with a history of [[paranoid delusion]]s.

==Origin==
Psychologist Brendan Maher named the effect after [[Martha Beall Mitchell]].&amp;lt;ref name=Maher1988&amp;gt;Maher, Brendan A. (1988) &amp;quot;Anomalous Experience and Delusional Thinking: The Logic of Explanations&amp;quot;. In T. Oltmanns and B. Maher (eds) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Delusional Beliefs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. New York: Wiley Interscience&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Mrs. Mitchell was the wife of [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]], [[United States Attorney General|Attorney-General]] in the [[Nixon administration]]. When she alleged that [[White House]] officials were engaged in illegal activities, her claims were attributed to mental illness. Ultimately, however, the facts of the [[Watergate scandal]] vindicated her and garnered the label, &amp;quot;The [[Cassandra (metaphor)|Cassandra]] of Watergate&amp;quot;. However, many of her allegations remain unproven, such as her claim that she had been drugged and put under guard during a visit to California, after her husband had been summoned back to [[Washington, D.C.]], in order to prevent her from leaving the hotel or making phone calls to the news media.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Reeves, Richard &amp;apos;&amp;apos;President Nixon: Alone in the White House&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p. 511.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
