        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;MATH-MATIC&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the marketing name for the AT-3 [[compiler]]. Early [[programming language]] for [[UNIVAC I]] and [[UNIVAC II]]. Intended as an improvement over [[FORTRAN]]. Created by a group led by [[Charles Katz]] in 1957.

Sperry Rand released a commercial compiler for its UNIVAC. Developed by [[Grace Hopper]] and others as a refinement of her earlier innovation, the A-0 compiler, the new version was called MATH-MATIC. Earlier work on the [[A-0_System | A-0]] through [[A-2 (programming language)|A-2]] compilers led to the development of the first English-language business data processing compiler, B-0 (FLOW-MATIC), also completed in 1957. [[FLOW-MATIC]] served as a model on which to build with input from other sources and was the main inspiration for [[COBOL]].
