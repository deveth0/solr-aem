The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Macquarie Dictionary&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[dictionary]] of [[Australian English]]. It also pays considerable attention to [[New Zealand English]]. Originally it was a publishing project of Jacaranda Press, a Brisbane educational publisher, for which an editorial committee was formed, largely from the Linguistics department of [[Macquarie University]] in [[Sydney]], Australia. It is published by Macquarie Dictionary Publishers Pty Ltd, a company specifically established for the task, currently owned by [[Macmillan Publishers]]. In October 2006 it moved away from [[Macquarie University]] to the [[University of Sydney]] where it is located in Fisher Library. It is notable for its extensive inclusion of [[encyclopaedia|encyclopaedic]] content: a great many [[proper name]]s, particularly of Australian people and places, are included.

==History==
The original version of the Macquarie Dictionary was based on Hamlyn&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Encyclopedic World Dictionary]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of 1971, which in turn was based on [[Random House]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[American College Dictionary]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of 1947, which was based on the 1927 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Century Dictionary|New Century Dictionary]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was based on [[The Imperial Dictionary of the English Language]], which itself was based on Noah Webster&amp;apos;s American Dictionary of the English Language second edition of 1841.

Since its first publication in 1981, its usage has grown so that over time, it has come to rival longer-established dictionaries from elsewhere in the English speaking world as a standard authority on the English language within Australia.

The second edition was published in 1991 and it introduced encyclopaedic content to many entries. The third edition, published in 1997, made use of an inhouse corpus of Australian writing, Ozcorp, to add a large number of examples of Australian usage, to give some of the flavour of an historical dictionary. This edition also gave a good coverage of English in Asia. The fourth edition, published in 2005, increases the number of citations, includes etymologies for many phrases and pays particular attention to Australian regionalisms. The fifth edition was published on October 2009 and places particular emphasis on words relating to the environment and [[climate change]].

==Spelling==
The dictionary records standard Australian English spelling, which is closer to [[British English|British]] and [[Canadian English|Canadian]] spelling than [[American English|American]] spelling, with spellings like &amp;apos;&amp;apos;colour&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;centre&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;defence&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;practice/practise&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (noun/verb). It gives &amp;apos;&amp;apos;-ise&amp;apos;&amp;apos; spellings first, listing &amp;apos;&amp;apos;-ize&amp;apos;&amp;apos; spellings as acceptable variants, unlike the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and some other dictionaries of British English, which continue to prefer &amp;apos;&amp;apos;-ize&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;-ise&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in spite of the opposite tendency amongst the British general public (see [[Oxford spelling]]).

==Versions==
A number of smaller versions are available, including a pocket edition, as well as companion volumes such as a [[thesaurus]]. An online subscription-based version is also available. The latest edition of the main complete version of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Macquarie Dictionary&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the fifth, which was published in 2009. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Macquarie Australian Slang Dictionary&amp;apos;&amp;apos; published in 2004 is an up-to-date record of Australian slang. A range of dictionaries from the complete to a small dictionary is available as an [[iPhone]] or Android application, from [[mobile phone]]s, and as an [[e-book]] to online dictionary subscribers.
