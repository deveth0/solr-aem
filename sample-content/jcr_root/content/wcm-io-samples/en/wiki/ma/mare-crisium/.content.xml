&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mare Crisium&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sea of Crises&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;) is a [[lunar mare]] located in the [[Moon]]&amp;apos;s Crisium basin, just northeast of [[Mare Tranquillitatis]]. The basin is of the [[Lunar geologic timescale|Pre-Imbrian]] period, 4.55 to 3.85 billion years ago.

==Characteristics==
Mare Crisium is {{convert|555|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter,&amp;lt;ref name=USGS/&amp;gt; and 176,000&amp;amp;nbsp;km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; in area. It has a very flat floor, with a ring of wrinkled ridges toward its outer boundaries. Ghost craters (craters that have largely been buried under deposits of other material), are located to the south.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Autostar Suite Astronomer Edition&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. CD-ROM. Meade, April 2006.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The mare has many notable features in and around it. The cape-like feature protruding into the southeast of the mare is [[Promontorium Agarum]]. On the western rim of the mare is the [[Palimpsest#Extended usages|palimpsest]] [[Yerkes (crater)|Yerkes]]. The [[Impact crater|crater]] [[Picard (crater)|Picard]] is located just to the east of Yerkes, and northwest of Picard is the crater [[Peirce (crater)|Peirce]]. [[Mare Anguis]] can be seen northeast of Mare Crisium.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |

Mare Serenitatis is an example of a [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mascon]], an anomalous gravitational region on the moon.

==Names==

Like most of the other maria on the Moon, Mare Crisium was named by [[Giovanni Riccioli]], whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mapping and Naming the Moon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.61.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

By the 17th century, Mare Crisium had acquired the name &amp;apos;Caspian Sea&amp;apos;, being labelled as such by [[Thomas Harriot]], [[Pierre Gassendi]] and [[Michael Van Langren]]. Ewen A. Whitaker speculates that it received this name because it occupies roughly the same position on the Moon&amp;apos;s face as does the [[Caspian Sea]] on Earth, with respect to [[T and O map|maps of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mapping and Naming the Moon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.7.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The English astronomer [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]&amp;apos;s map of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;c&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.1600 calls it &amp;apos;Brittania&amp;apos; after [[Great Britain|Britain]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mapping and Naming the Moon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.7.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Observation and exploration==
Mare Crisium is just visible from Earth with the naked eye as a small dark spot on the edge of the Moon&amp;apos;s face.

It is the site of the crash-landing of Soviet [[Luna 15]] probe in 1969. A soil sample from Mare Crisium was successfully brought to Earth on 22 August 1976 by the Soviet lunar mission [[Luna 24]].

==In popular culture==
*In [[Robert A. Heinlein]]&amp;apos;s novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Mare Crisium is the site of a lunar colony named Luna City.
*&amp;quot;[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]&amp;quot;, the [[short story]] from which [[Arthur C. Clarke]] developed the film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; with [[Stanley Kubrick]], takes place on the Mare Crisium.
* The Brazilian [[death metal]] band [[Krisiun]] supposedly based their name on the crater.{{fact|date=April 2012}}
* In the game &amp;quot;Mass Effect&amp;quot; (2007), the assignment UNC: Rogue VI, operational zone is established in the southern portion of Mare Crisium.
