&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Maieutics&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPAc-en|m|eɪ|ˈ|juː|t|ɨ|k|s}} or {{IPAc-en|m|aɪ|ˈ|juː|t|ɨ|k|s}}) is a [[pedagogy|pedagogical method]] based on the idea that the [[truth]] is latent in the [[mind]] of every [[human being]] due to innate reason but has to be &amp;quot;given birth&amp;quot; by answering intelligently proposed questions (or problems).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Etymology==
The word is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] noun μαιευτική (τέχνη) from μαιευτικός, &amp;quot;[[obstetric]].&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;maieutic,&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Possible origin ==
The idea is reminiscent of the 4th century BC philosopher [[Plato]]. In the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; dialogues, Plato discusses the [[Socratic method]], a form of inquiry and debate between individuals with opposing viewpoints based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to illuminate ideas. It is a [[dialectic]]al method, often involving an oppositional discussion in which the defense of one point of view is pitted against the defense of another; one interlocutor may lead another to contradict himself in some way, strengthening the inquirer&amp;apos;s own point. As to maieutics, it is based on Plato&amp;apos;s [[theory of recollection]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;anamnesis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), so that it holds that knowledge is latent in the conscious mind, awaiting discovery. This discovery is sought through dialectic and in contrast to Plato&amp;apos;s theory, through [[inductive reasoning]] rather than [[deductive reasoning|deductive]].

In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theaetetus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the basic question is &amp;quot;What is knowledge?&amp;quot;. Theaetetus is a young student of [[mathematics]] who proposed three definitions that are refuted by Socrates, according to whom, knowledge cannot be defined as a perception, nor as a true opinion, nor as an explanation besides a true opinion. Socrates debates these arguments from a critical point of view by posing more questions, but never poses a conclusion on the matter of [[knowledge]] itself.

=== As presented by Plato ===
{{main|Anamnesis (philosophy)|Platonic epistemology}}
In [[philosophy]], maieutic concepts historically have their origin in Plato&amp;apos;s dialogues of Socrates.

In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Symposium (Plato)|The Symposium]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Socrates repeats the words of the priestess or wise woman [[Diotima of Mantinea]] who suggested that the [[soul]] is pregnant and wants to give birth, but the delivery requires assistance. Thus according to Plato, the role of the philosopher is to assist in this delivery, as would a [[midwifery|midwife]]. From this dialogue comes the word &amp;quot;maieutics&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;spiritual midwife.&amp;quot;

In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Theaetetus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Socrates is presented as a &amp;quot;spiritual midwife&amp;quot; and in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Meno]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, by posing questions to a slave who never learned geometry, Socrates leads him to “remember” how a square is doubled.

=== Orphism ===
Maieutics is an evolution of the technical methods of [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} They were based on the idea of reminiscence and the practice of [[Catharsis]] especially developed by [[Pythagoras]].

Maieutics consists in the belief that there is somehow a knowledge that is stored in the mind by [[tradition]] and the [[experience]] of past generations. Therefore, maieutics invites the individual to discover the truth that is latent in a person.
