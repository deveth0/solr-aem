&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Martín Perfecto de Cos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1800–1854) was a 19th-century [[Mexico|Mexican]] general.  He was married to Lucinda López de Santa Anna, sister of [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]].

==Military career during the Texas Revolution==

Cos was appointed commander of military forces in Texas in July 1835 and was sent there to disarm any rebellious citizens. He arrived in Texas on September 21, 1835 with 300 soldiers. Cos proceeded to the town of [[Goliad, Texas|Goliad]] on October 1, then moved on to [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio de Béxar]]. Cos ordered the arrest of [[William B. Travis]] and any other rebel leaders. Once in San Antonio ([[Siege of Béxar]]), Cos was assailed by Texan forces under the leadership of [[Stephen F. Austin]]. The town was put under siege by the Texan army. After a 56-day siege of the town and Alamo mission, on December 9, Cos surrendered the town of [[San Antonio]] and weapons to the Texans then proceeded to leave Texas. Cos and his men were allowed their muskets for protection and one four-pound [[cannon]]. Mexican losses during the siege were about 150. On his way south, Cos met up with [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]]&amp;apos;s forces at [[Laredo, TX|Laredo]] marching north to put down the rebellion.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Claudia Hazlewood, &amp;quot;COS, MARTIN PERFECTO DE,&amp;quot; Handbook of Texas Online [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fco76], accessed January 23, 2012. Published by the Texas State Historical Association.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Cos returned to San Antonio and led a column of 300 soldiers against the northwest corner of the [[Alamo]] on March 6, 1836. Eventually Cos&amp;apos; soldiers overran the Alamo&amp;apos;s north wall.

On April 21, 1836, Cos arrived with over five hundred reinforcements for Santa Anna shortly before the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. He was taken prisoner on April 24, after his battalion was smashed and routed by a combined attack by Texas volunteers under Colonels [[Sidney Sherman]] and [[Edward Burleson]].

==Activity during the Mexican-American War==
Cos was in charge of the garrison at [[Tuxpan]], but did not play a significant role in the fighting with the [[United States Army]].
