        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Matthew of Westminster&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, long regarded as the author of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Flores Historiarum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Matthew of Westminster|volume=15}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; is now thought never to have existed.

The error was first discovered in 1826 by [[Francis Turner Palgrave]], who said that Matthew was &amp;quot;a phantom who never existed,&amp;quot; and later the truth of this statement was completely proved by [[Henry Richards Luard]]. The name appears to have been taken from that of [[Matthew Paris]], from whose &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chronica majora&amp;apos;&amp;apos; the earlier part of the work was mainly copied, and from [[Westminster Abbey]], where the work was partially written.
