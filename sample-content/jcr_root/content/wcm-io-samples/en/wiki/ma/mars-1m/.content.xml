&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mars 1M&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a series of two [[unmanned spacecraft]] which were used in the first [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] missions to explore [[Mars]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;EA&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/mars1m.htm|title=Mars 1M|last=Wade|first=Mark|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=26 August 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; They were the earliest missions of the [[Mars program]]. The Western media dubbed the spacecraft &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marsnik&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;, a [[portmanteau]] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mars&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sputnik]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mars 1M No.1&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, known in the west as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marsnik 1&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mars 1960A&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Korabl 4&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was destroyed in a launch failure on October 10, 1960. In 1962, [[NASA Administrator]] [[James E. Webb]] informed the [[United States Congress]] that NASA believed the mission was an attempt at a [[Mars flyby]] probe. Some Soviet scientists{{Who|date=August 2010}} involved with the program at that time claim no knowledge of this mission, stating that only the second launch was an intended Mars mission. However, [[V.G. Perminov]], the leading designer of planetary spacecraft at the [[Lavochkin design bureau]], states that this mission was indeed intended for Mars and was identical to the later mission.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mars 1M No.2&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, known in the west as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marsnik 2&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Korabl 5&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mars 1960B&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was launched on October 14, 1960.

Both Mars 1M spacecraft were launched by [[Molniya (rocket)|Molniya]] rockets. The unproven third stage malfunctioned on both flights as cavitation in the fuel lines prevented the engines from developing adequate thrust, and, as a result, neither spacecraft achieved its initial [[geocentric orbit|geocentric]] parking orbit. Mars 1M No.2 reached an altitude of 120&amp;amp;nbsp;km before reentry.

Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] had planned to bring models of the Mars probes for showcasing at his visit to the UN that month, but as both launches failed, they remained packed.

==Mission profile==

The objectives of the mission were to investigate interplanetary space between Earth and Mars, to study Mars and return surface images from a flyby trajectory, and to study the effects of extended spaceflight on onboard instruments and provide radio communications from long distances.

==Spacecraft and subsystems==
NASA describes the spacecraft as:
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;nearly identical to the [[Venera 1]] design, a cylindrical body about 2 meters high with two [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]] wings, a 2.33 meter high-gain net antenna, and a long antenna arm, and had a mass of about 650 kg. It carried a 10 kg science payload consisting of a [[magnetometer]] on a boom, [[cosmic ray]] counter, [[plasma-ion trap]], a [[radiometer]], a [[micrometeorite]] detector, and a [[spectroreflectometer]] to study the CH band, a possible indicator of [[life]] on Mars. These instruments were mounted on the outside of the spacecraft. A [[photo-television camera]] was held in a sealed module in the spacecraft and could take pictures through a viewport when a sensor indicated the Sun-illuminated martian surface was in view.

Attitude was controlled by a Sun-star sensor with attitude correction performed by a [[unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine|dimethylhydrazine]]/[[nitric acid]] [[bipropellant rocket]] engine. The spacecraft orientation was to be maintained so that the solar panels faced the Sun throughout the flight. Power was provided by the two-square meter solar panels which charged [[Silver-oxide battery|silver-zinc batteries]]. Radio communications were made using a decimeter band transmitter via the high gain antenna for spacecraft commands and telemetry. Radio bearing was used to maintain the antennas&amp;apos; orientation to Earth. Images were to be transferred using an 8-cm wavelength transmitter through the high-gain antenna. A fourth stage was added to the booster, the [[Molniya]] or 8K78, the new launcher was designated SL-6/A-2-e.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url = http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=MARSNK2 | title = Marsnik 2 | publisher = NASA | accessdate = 2009-06-11}} (public domain)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
