&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mazarine Marie Pingeot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born December 18, 1974 in [[Avignon]], [[Vaucluse]]), who changed her name to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mazarine Marie Pingeot-Mitterrand&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 2005, is a writer, journalist and professor.

==Life==

Pingeot is the daughter of former [[President of France|French president]] [[François Mitterrand]] and his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] [[Anne Pingeot]]. She is said to be named after the [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]], the oldest library in [[France]], because of her parents&amp;apos; love for books. The existence of this daughter of president Mitterrand was long hidden from the press.  Ensuring confidentiality about it was one of the motivations behind some of the illegal wiretapping that Mitterrand ordered under the guise of fighting [[terrorism]].

She was a student first at the elite [[lycée Henri-IV]] in Paris and then at the [[École Normale Supérieure Lettres et Sciences Humaines|École Normale Supérieure de Fontenay-Saint-Cloud]] (now named the [[École Normale Supérieure Lettres et Sciences Humaines]]), a highly prestigious school. In 1997 she passed the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[agrégation]] de philosophie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and then started to write her Ph.D. thesis on the philosopher [[Spinoza]], working as an assistant at the [[Université de Provence Aix-Marseille I]].

She is also a journalist (writing for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[ELLE]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; magazine between 1999 and 2001) and a television anchor (on a French cable television channel, [[Paris Première]]).

==Works==
In 1998, she published her first novel, titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Premier Roman&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;First Novel&amp;quot;), which was not highly praised by critics but was translated into many languages, including English.  In 2000 she published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zeyn or the Reconquest&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, for which Charles Bremner of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Times]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; wrote &amp;quot;If there was a prize for braving the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ridicule&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of critics, it would go to Mazarine Pingeot&amp;quot; (May 8, 2000). In 2003, she published a series of literary comments, &amp;quot;They told me who I was&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;they&amp;quot; being the books). In February 2005, she published her fourth book, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Not a Word&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a diary about her childhood life as a national secret. In 2007 she published her fifth book, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Le Cimetière des poupées&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (The Cemetery of the Dolls), a novel about a woman who kills her baby and puts it in a freezer.

==Family==
A son, Ascot, was born on July 11, 2005, to Mazarine Pingeot and her companion, film producer Mohamed Ulad-Mohand. Their second child, a daughter named Tara, was born on October 5, 2007.
