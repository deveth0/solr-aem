Brémont died in her sleep at a retirement home in Candé. She was considered the world&amp;apos;s oldest person since the death of [[Eva Morris]] of Britain in November, just four days before the latter&amp;apos;s 115th birthday.}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

This means she was the oldest living person at the turn of the century, and the new [[millennium]], and therefore the person with the earliest birthdate that lived into the 21st century. Brémont was the first 114- as well as 115-year-old to live in three different centuries. Her record as the oldest person to have lived in three centuries has since been surpassed by several people, first in 2002 by [[Maude Farris-Luse]]. Brémont was the second Frenchwoman to hold the title of the oldest living person, after [[longevity]] world record holder [[Jeanne Calment]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|author=AlterNet / By Mad Dog |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/11087/ |title=MAD DOG: Bottling the Fountain of Youth |publisher=Alternet.org |date=24 June 2001 |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Biography==
Brémont was born as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marie Marthe Augustine Mesange&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Noëllet]],&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;AP-wire&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; and her first husband, railroad worker Constant Lemaitre, was killed in [[World War I|the First World War]]. She married again to a taxi driver, Florentin Brémont, who died in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Over the course of her life, she worked in a [[pharmaceutical]] factory, as a nanny and as a [[seamstress]]. At 103, she was hit by a car and broke her arm as a result.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|author=8 June 2001 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/08/local/me-8038 |title=Marie Bremont, 115; Believed to Be Oldest Person in the World - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=8 June 2001 |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; She died at her retirement home at age [[list of the verified oldest people|115 years 42 days]] in [[Candé]], [[Maine-et-Loire]], having had no children, and was the last documented surviving person born in 1886. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}
