&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marooning&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the intentional leaving of someone in a remote area, such as an uninhabited island. The word first appears in writing in approximately 1709,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} and is derived from the term [[maroon (people)|maroon]], a word for a fugitive slave, which could be a corruption of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;cimarrón&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, meaning a household animal (or slave) who has run &amp;quot;wild&amp;quot;.

The practice was a penalty for crewmen, or for captains at the hands of a crew. Generally, a marooned man was set on a deserted island, often no more than a [[shoal|sand bar]] at [[tide|low tide]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite book|author=Kraske, Robert|date=2005|title=Marooned: The Strange But True Adventures of Alexander Selkirk|publisher= Clarion Books|isbn=0-618-56843-3}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He would be given some food, a container of water, and a loaded pistol so he could commit [[suicide]] if he desired.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite book|author=Hickox, Rex|title=All you wanted to know about 18th century Royal Navy|pages= 121 |publisher=Lulu.com|date=2007|isbn=978-1-4116-3057-4}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The outcome of marooning was usually fatal, but [[William Greenaway]] and some men loyal to him survived being marooned, as did pirate captain [[Edward England]].

The chief practitioners of marooning were 17th and 18th century [[piracy|pirates]], to such a degree that they were frequently referred to as &amp;quot;marooners.&amp;quot; The [[Pirate code|pirate articles]] of captains [[Bartholomew Roberts]] and [[John Phillips (pirate)|John Phillips]] specify marooning as a punishment for cheating one&amp;apos;s fellow pirates or other offenses. In this context, to be marooned is euphemistically to be &amp;quot;made governor of an island&amp;quot;.

During the late 18th century in the American South, &amp;quot;marooning&amp;quot; took on a humorous additional meaning describing an extended camping-out picnic over a period of several days (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oxford English Dictionary&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

The most famous literary reference to marooning probably occurs in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Treasure Island]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in which [[Ben Gunn (Treasure Island)|Ben Gunn]] is left marooned on the island for three years.

Another famous marooning, only partly for punishment, was leaving the sailor [[Alexander Selkirk]] on [[Robinson Crusoe Island|Juan Fernández Island]] off the coast of [[Chile]], in the Pacific Ocean. Selkirk, a sailor with the [[William Dampier|Dampier]] expedition, was worried about the unseaworthy condition of his ship, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Cinque Ports (1703 ship)|Cinque Ports]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and had argued with the captain until he left him ashore on the island where they had briefly stopped for water and food supplies. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cinque Ports&amp;apos;&amp;apos; later sank with the loss of most of her crew. Selkirk was not rescued until four years later, by [[Woodes Rogers]]. Selkirk&amp;apos;s travails provided the inspiration for [[Daniel Defoe]]&amp;apos;s novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Robinson Crusoe]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Today, one of the islands on the Chilean coast is named [[Alejandro Selkirk Island]] and another one [[Robinson Crusoe Island]].
