&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mare Humorum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sea of Moisture&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;) is a [[lunar mare]]. The [[impact basin]] it is located in is 825 kilometers across.

==Geology==
It was not sampled by the Apollo program, so a precise age has not been determined. However, geological mapping indicates that it is intermediate in age between the [[mare Imbrium|Imbrium]] and [[Mare Nectaris|Nectaris]] Basins, suggesting an age of about 3.9 billion years. Humorum Basin is filled with a thick layer of mare [[basalt]], believed to exceed 3 kilometers in thickness at the center of the basin.

On the north edge of Mare Humorum is the large [[Impact crater|crater]] [[Gassendi (crater)|Gassendi]], which was considered as a possible landing site for [[Apollo 17]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Names==
Like most of the other maria on the Moon, Mare Humorum was named by [[Giovanni Riccioli]], whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mapping and Naming the Moon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.61.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Previously, the 17th century astronomer [[Pierre Gassendi]] had named it Anticaspia (&amp;apos;opposite to the Caspian&amp;apos;, referring to [[Mare Crisium]], which he had named after the [[Caspian Sea]]),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mapping and Naming the Moon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.33&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and [[Michael Van Langren]] had labelled it the Mare Venetum (&amp;quot;[[Venice|Venetian]] Sea&amp;quot;) in his 1645 map.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mapping and Naming the Moon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.41, 198.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Johannes Hevelius]] called it Sinus Sirbonis (&amp;quot;Bay of Serbonis&amp;quot;, after the lake of [[Serbonis]], now [[Lake Bardawil]], in [[Egypt]]) in his 1647 map.
