==Districts of Manor Castle ward==
===Manor===
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Manor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{gbmapping|SK387862}}) is a large [[low-rise]] [[housing estate]] in eastern [[Sheffield, England|Sheffield]], [[England]].  It is divided into &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Manor Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Upper&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lower Manor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Manor Top&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Until the 1930s, the area was mostly rural, with housing only along the main roads.  In the [[Victorian period]] The estate was started during the 1930s as a [[Garden city movement|garden city]] type development, to alleviate overcrowding in central Sheffield.  However, unlike true garden cities, places of work were not included in the scheme. Though nearby Darnall and Attercliffe had some industry.

Manor is named for [[Sheffield Manor]], that is adjacent to Manor Park.  Manor Top is now served by the [[Sheffield Supertram]].  Large areas of the estate were demolished, and in some cases rebuilt with private funding, from the late 1990s onwards.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wybourn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{gbmapping|SK373871}}) is a [[council estate]], built in the 1920s, lying north of Manor Park and east of [[Park Hill]].  In the north west of the district lies [[Hyde Park, South Yorkshire|Hyde Park]], originally a larger version of Park Hill, but since reduced in scale with the demolition of some blocks and the recladding and alteration of circulation elsewhere.
