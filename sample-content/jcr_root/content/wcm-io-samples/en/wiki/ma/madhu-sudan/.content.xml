{{Refimprove|article|date=January 2008}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Madhu Sudan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born September 12, 1966) is an [[Indian American|Indian-American]] [[computer scientist]]. He was [[professor]] of [[computer science]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and a member of [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] until 2009.

==Career==
He received his bachelor&amp;apos;s degree in computer science from [[IIT Delhi]] in 1987 and his doctoral degree in computer science at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1992.  He was a research staff member at the [[IBM]] [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]] in [[Yorktown Heights, New York]] from 1992 to 1997 and moved to MIT after that. Since June 2009, he&amp;apos;s been at [[Microsoft Research]] New England as a permanent researcher.

==Research Contribution and Awards==
He was awarded the Rolf [[Nevanlinna Prize]] at the 24th [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 2002. The prize recognizes outstanding work in the [[mathematics|mathematical]] aspects of computer science. Sudan was honored for his work in advancing the theory of [[probabilistically checkable proof]]s&amp;amp;mdash;a way to recast a mathematical proof in computer language for additional checks on its validity&amp;amp;mdash;and developing [[error-correcting code]]s. For the same work, he received the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]&amp;apos;s Distinguished Doctoral Dissertation Award in 1993 and the [[Gödel Prize]] in 2001. He is a Fellow of the ACM (2008).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://people.csail.mit.edu/madhu/bio.txt Biography]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Sudan has made important contributions to several areas of theoretical computer science, including probabilistically checkable proofs, non-approximability of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems, and error-correcting codes.
