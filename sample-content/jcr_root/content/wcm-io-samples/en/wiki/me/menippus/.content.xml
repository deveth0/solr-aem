&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Menippus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-el|Μένιππος}}; 3rd century BC) of [[Gadara]], was a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] and [[satirist]]. His works, which are all lost, were an important influence on [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] and [[Lucian]]. The [[Menippean satire]] genre is named after him.

==Life==
Little is known about the life of Menippus. He was a native of [[Gadara]] in [[Coele-Syria]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Stephanus Byz.; Strabo, xvi.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The ancient sources agree that he was a [[Slavery in Ancient Greece|slave]]. He was in the service of a citizen of [[Pontus]], but in some way obtained his freedom and lived at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]. [[Diogenes Laërtius]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 99, 100&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; relates a dubious story that he amassed a fortune as a [[usury|money-lender]], lost it, and committed [[suicide]] through grief.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;The tradition that he was a moneylender and speculator in marine insurance is probably apocryphal, resting as it does on the always dubious authority of [[Hermippus of Smyrna|Hermippus]].&amp;quot; Donald Dudley, (1937) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A History of Cynicism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, page 70&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Lucian]] ranks Menippus with [[Antisthenes]], [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]], and [[Crates of Thebes|Crates]] as the most notable of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]].

==Writings==
His works (written in a mixture of [[prose]] and [[poetry|verse]]) are all lost. He discussed serious subjects in a spirit of ridicule, and especially delighted in attacking the [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] and [[Stoicism|Stoics]]. [[Strabo]] and [[Stephanus of Byzantium|Stephanus]] call him the &amp;quot;earnest-jester&amp;quot; ({{lang-el|σπουδογελοίος}}, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Spoudaiogeloion|spoudogeloios]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). His writings exercised considerable influence upon later literature, and the [[Menippean satire]] genre is named after him. Although the writings of Menippus no longer survive, there are some fragments of [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Saturae Menippeae&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which were written in imitation of Menippus.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Cicero, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Academica&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, i. 2, 8; Aulus Gellius, ii. 18; Macrobius, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sat.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; i. 11&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; One of the dialogues attributed to [[Lucian]], his avowed imitator, who frequently mentions him, is called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Menippus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but since the sub-title (&amp;quot;The Oracle of the Dead&amp;quot;) resembles that of a work ascribed to Menippus by Diogenes Laërtius, it has been suggested that it is imitated from his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Necromancy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Diogenes Laërtius says the following works were written by Menippus:&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 101&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
* Νέκυια - &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Necromancy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
* Διαθῆκαι - &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wills&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
* Ἐπιστολαὶ κεκομψευμέναι ἀπὸ τῶν θεῶν προσώπου - &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Letters artificially composed as if by the Gods&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
* Πρὸς τοὺς φυσικοὺς καὶ μαθηματικοὺς καὶ γραμματικοὺς - &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Replies to the Natural Philosophers, and Mathematicians, and Grammarians&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
* Γονὰς Ἐπικούρου - &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Birth of Epicurus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
* Τὰς θρησκευομένας ὑπ&amp;apos; αὐτῶν εἰκάδας - &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The School&amp;apos;s reverence of the twentieth day&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (celebrated in the Epicurean school)

In addition, [[Athenaeus]] mentions works called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Symposium&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Athenaeus, 14.629F&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arcesilaus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Athenaeus, 14.664E&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and Diogenes Laërtius mentions a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sale of Diogenes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-el|Διογένους Πράσει}})&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 29.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; written by Menippus which seems to be the main source of the story that [[Diogenes of Sinope]] was captured by pirates and sold into slavery.
