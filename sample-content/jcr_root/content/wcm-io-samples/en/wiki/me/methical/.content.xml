&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Methical&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an online alias of an unknown [[MMORPG]] player. He created his name in homage to the rapper [[Method Man]] Methical may be one of the most famous success stories within the [[virtual economies]] of  MMORPG landscapes. After earning a supposed $100,000, he and two friends became infamous after Methical posted a detailed step by step account of exactly how he found a working [[duping (gaming)|dupe]] in [[Everquest 2]]. The story &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://plaguelands.com/?page_id=172 |title=The Best Search Links on the Net |publisher=plaguelands.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-21}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; became one of the most popular culture reads for the MMORPG communities. The identity of Methical is not known, yet there has been much response from [[Sony Online Entertainment]] as well as several news sources discussing the ramifications of this type of action on [[virtual economies]]. There is some doubt that Methical&amp;apos;s account of events is accurate, but it has been confirmed by Sony that basic facts are true. One man basically had a counterfeit money machine within EverQuest 2 and used it to spread currency on every server for what could be a large financial gain. The duping occurred early within the first months of Everquest 2 going live, and Methical was banned within a couple months, netting him a huge profit before he was removed from the game.
