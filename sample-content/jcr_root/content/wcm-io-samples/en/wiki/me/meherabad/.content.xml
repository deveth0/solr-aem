&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Meherabad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (meher flourishing: &amp;quot;abad&amp;quot; meaning a prosperous settlement, or a flourishing colony) was originally an [[ashram]] established by [[Meher Baba]] near Arangaon Village, [[India]] in 1923 about {{convert|9|km|0}} south of [[Ahmednagar]]. It is now the site of [[Samadhi of Meher Baba|Meher Baba&amp;apos;s samadhi]] (tomb-shrine) as well as facilities and accommodations for [[pilgrim]]s. A large number of buildings mostly associated with the earlier decades of Babaâ€™s work, the graves of disciples, and a range of pilgrim accommodation and charitable establishments are also there. Many Baba lovers work or live in the vicinity.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Avatar Meher Baba, His Life, His Message and His Followers,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Copyright 1996 Ray Kerkhove, Peter Milne and Ray Kerkhove, &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The samadhi structure itself is located at  {{coord|19|01|52.05|N|74|42|50.90|E}}.

Meherabad is a popular place of [[pilgrimage]] for both Eastern and Western followers of Meher Baba with reported numbers of around 30,000 annual pilgrims at [[Amartithi]] (the celebration of his death, January 31).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.ambppct.org/events/events.php Avatar Meher Baba Trust - Calendar of Events]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The [[Meher Pilgrim Center]] and Meher Pilgrim Retreat located there are open to the public. There is also a [[free dispensary]] and school.

Established in May 1923, Meherabad was the first permanent residence of Meher Baba and his disciples in [[Ahmednagar district]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by Bhau Kalchuri, Manifestation, Inc. 1986. p. 519&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 1944 Meher Baba moved his residence north to [[Meherazad]] located {{convert|24|km|0}} away on the other side of Ahmedagar.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Meher Baba&amp;apos;s Last Sahavas, pp. 15-16
