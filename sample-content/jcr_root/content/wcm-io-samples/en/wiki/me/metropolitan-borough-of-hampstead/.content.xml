The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Metropolitan boroughs of the County of London|Metropolitan borough]] of the [[County of London]] from 1900 to 1965, when it was amalgamated with the [[Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras]] and the [[Metropolitan Borough of Holborn]] to form the [[London Borough of Camden]].

It included [[Primrose Hill]], [[Hampstead]], [[Belsize Park]], [[West Hampstead]], [[South Hampstead]], much of [[Hampstead Heath]] and part of [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]]. Some street signs still bear the &amp;apos;Borough of Hampstead&amp;apos; name.

==Coat of arms==
The arms were granted in 1931, and are based on a device used by the Hampstead Vestry without authority, and adopted by the Council on its formation in 1900.

The mitre stands for the [[Westminster Abbey]], to which the Manor of Hampstead was granted by [[Ethelred the Unready]] in 986, and remained in its possession until 1539. The fleurs-de-lys and stag&amp;apos;s head are from the arms of the Hickes family, one of whom, Viscount Camden, purchased the Manor. On his death in 1629 it passed to the Noel family from whose arms are taken the fretty chief. The Manor was sold to Sir William Langthorne in 1707, who is represented by the white cross and red fleurs-de-lys from his arms.

The holly is from the seal of the old Hampstead Vestry, which grows profusely in the area.

==Population and area==
The metropolitan borough was conterminous with the [[Vestry]] authority, when it was formed in 1900. Statistics compiled by the [[London County Council]], in 1901 to show the population growth in London, over the preceding century.

Hampstead had an area of {{convert|2265|acre|km2|1}} in 1901. The populations recorded in National Censuses were:
