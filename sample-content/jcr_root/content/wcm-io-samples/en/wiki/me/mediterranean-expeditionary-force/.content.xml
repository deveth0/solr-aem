The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mediterranean [[Expeditionary warfare|Expeditionary Force]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (MEF) was part of the [[British Army during World War I]], that commanded all Allied forces at [[Gallipoli (battle)|Gallipoli]] and [[British Salonika Army|Salonika]].  This included the initial naval operation to force the straits of the [[Dardanelles]].  Its headquarters was formed in March 1915.  The MEF was originally commanded by General [[Sir Ian Hamilton]] until he was dismissed due to the failure of the [[29th Division (United Kingdom)|29th Division]] at Gallipoli.  Command briefly passed to General [[William Birdwood]], commander of the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (army corps)|Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]], but for the duration of the Gallipoli campaign it was General Sir [[Charles Carmichael Monro|Charles Monro]] who led the MEF.

While the Gallipoli theatre was the only active [[Mediterranean]] theatre, the MEF was used to refer to the forces at Gallipoli.  With the opening of the Salonika front in October 1915, the forces at Gallipoli were referred to as the [[British Dardanelles Army|Dardanelles Army]] and the Salonika contingent became the [[British Salonika Army|Salonika Army]] on the [[Macedonian front (World War I)]].

Once Salonika became the sole Mediterranean theatre the MEF was commanded by General [[Archibald Murray]] who was based in [[Egypt]] and whose command also involved defence of the [[Suez Canal]] from [[Turkey|Turkish]] attacks.  As the importance of the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] front grew, a separate headquarters called the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] was formed (in March 1916).

Supposedly when the British [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]], was preparing the Mediterranean expedition he intended to name the headquarters the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Constantinople]] Expeditionary Force&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; but Hamilton suggested this might be a bit of a giveaway.
