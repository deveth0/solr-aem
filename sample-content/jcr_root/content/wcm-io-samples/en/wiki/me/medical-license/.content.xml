        text="&lt;p&gt;In most countries, only persons with a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;medical license&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; bestowed either by a specified government-approved [[professional association]] or a [[government agency]] are authorized to practice [[medicine]].  Licenses are not granted automatically to all people with [[medical school|medical degree]]s.  A medical school graduate must receive a license to practice medicine before he or she can be called a [[physician]] in a legal sense, a process that usually entails testing or examinations by a medical board.  The medical license is the documentation of authority to practice [[medicine]] within a certain locality.

==United States==

In the [[United States]], medical licenses are usually granted by individual states. Only those with medical degrees from schools listed in the [[Avicenna Directories#AVICENNA Directory for medicine|AVICENNA Directory for medicine]] or the [[FAIMER]] [[International Medical Education Directory]] are permitted to apply for medical licensure.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfmg.org/2009ib/ibcert.html#img_define |title=ECFMG 2009 Information Booklet - ECFMG Certification |publisher=Ecfmg.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-08}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The federal government does not grant licenses. A physician practicing in a federal facility may have a license from any state, not just the one they are residing in. The practice of &amp;quot;tele-medicine&amp;quot; has made it common for doctors to consult or interpret images and information from a distant location. Most states have special licensure for this.

The licensure process for most physicians takes between 3 to 6 months due to the extensive background checks, educational, training, and historical primary source verifications which are required.

==UK==
Medical license is US-centric terminology. In the UK and in other countries the analogous instrument is called registration; i.e. being on the register or being/getting struck off (of the register). See [[General Medical Council]] for UK practices and links to practices in other countries.
