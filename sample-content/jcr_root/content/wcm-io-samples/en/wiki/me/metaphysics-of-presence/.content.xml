The concept of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;metaphysics of presence&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an important consideration within the area of [[deconstruction]]. The deconstructive [[Interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]] holds that the entire [[history of philosophy|history]] of Western [[philosophy]] and its language and traditions has emphasized the desire for [[immediate]] access to meaning, and thus built a [[metaphysics]] or [[ontotheology]] around the privileging of presence over absence.

In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Being and Time]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Martin Heidegger]] argues that the concept of time prevalent in all Western thought has largely remained unchanged since the definition offered by [[Aristotle]] in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He says &amp;quot;Aristotle&amp;apos;s essay on time is the first detailed Interpretation of this phenomenon [time] which has come down to us. Every subsequent account of time, including [[Henri Bergson|Bergson&amp;apos;s]], has been essentially determined by it.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Being and Time&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, §6, 26&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Aristotle defined time as &amp;quot;the number of movement in respect of before and after&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Physics&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Book IV, part 11&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; By defining time in this way Aristotle is privileging what is [[present-at-hand]], namely the &amp;apos;presence&amp;apos; of time. Heidegger argues in response that &amp;quot;Entities are grasped in their Being as &amp;apos;presence&amp;apos;; this means that they are understood with regard to a definite mode of time - the &amp;apos;Present&amp;apos;&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Being and Time&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, §6, 26&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Central to Heidegger&amp;apos;s own philosophical project is the attempt to gain a more authentic understanding of time. Heidegger considers time to be the unity of three ecstases, the past, the present and the future.

Deconstructive thinkers, like [[Jacques Derrida]], describe their task as the questioning or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;deconstruction&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of this metaphysical tendency in philosophy. This argument is largely based on the earlier work of [[Martin Heidegger]], who in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Being and Time]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; claimed the parasitic nature of the theoretical attitude of pure presence upon a more originary involvement with the world in concepts such as the [[ready-to-hand]] and [[being-with]]. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is a more distant, but clear, influence as well.

The presence to which Heidegger refers is both a presence as in a &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; and also a presence as in an eternal, always present, as one might associate with god or the &amp;quot;eternal&amp;quot; [[Physical law|laws of science]]. This [[hypostatized]] (underlying) belief in presence is undermined by novel [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] ideas — such that presence itself does not subsist, but comes about primordially through the action of our futural projection, our realization of finitude and the reception or rejection of the traditions of our time.
