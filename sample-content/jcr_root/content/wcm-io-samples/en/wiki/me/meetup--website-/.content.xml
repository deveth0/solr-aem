&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Meetup&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an online [[social networking]] portal that facilitates offline group meetings in various localities around the world.  Meetup allows members to find and join groups unified by a common interest, such as politics, books, games, movies, health, pets, careers or hobbies. Users enter their ZIP code or their city and the topic they want to meet about, and the website helps them arrange a place and time to meet. Topic listings are also available for users who only enter a location.  Meetup receives revenue by charging Organizer Dues to administrators of groups,  currently at $12 to $19 per month depending on the payment plan.

Following the [[September 11 attacks]], the site&amp;apos;s co-founder [[Scott Heiferman]] publicly stated that the manner in which people in [[New York City]] came together in the aftermath of that traumatic event inspired him to use the Internet to make it easier for people to connect with strangers in their community.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Celia Sankar, &amp;quot;[http://celiasankar.com/blog/2011/11/16/meetup-ceo-talks-about-doing-what-you-love/ Meetup CEO talks about doing what you love],&amp;quot; November 16, 2011.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Meetup, Inc. is based in [[New York City]].

==Statistics==
As of April 2013, the company claimed to have 13.4 million members in 196 countries and 125,247 groups,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meetup.com/about/ |title=About |publisher=Meetup |date= |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; although these figures may include inactive members and groups.
