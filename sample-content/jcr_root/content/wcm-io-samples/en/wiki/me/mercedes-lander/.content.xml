&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mercedes Sherida Lander&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born January 25, 1984) is the [[drummer]] and [[backing vocalist]] for the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[alternative metal]] group [[Kittie]]. Her sister, [[Morgan Lander]], also sings and plays guitar for Kittie. Other than Morgan she is the only other original member of Kittie.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p380977/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Kittie|last=Blanford|first=Roxanne |publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

She was also the leading vocals for a small Canadian project band called Night of the Demons. They were considered hardcore and focused on horror themed lyrics. They have only released one [[extended play|E.P.]] to date.  In 2011 Mercedes joined the all girl power pop band [[The Alcohollys]] which also includes the likes of [[Tanya Candler]], the original [[Kittie]] bass player. They are slated to put out an EP in early 2013.

Mercedes is famed for her heavy drumming style and extensive tattoos.
