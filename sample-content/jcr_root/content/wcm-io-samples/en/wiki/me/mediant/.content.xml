In [[music]], the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;mediant&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Latin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: to be in the middle&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mediant &amp;quot;Mediant&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Merriam-Webster.com&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) is the third [[degree (music)|scale degree]] of the [[diatonic scale]], being the [[note (music)|note]] halfway between the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] and the [[dominant (music)|dominant]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Benward &amp;amp; Saker (2003), p.32.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Similarly, the [[submediant]] is halfway between the tonic and [[subdominant]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Benward &amp;amp; Saker (2003), p.33.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The fifth note is almost always a perfect fifth, while the third note can equally be a minor or major third.

In [[Roman numeral analysis]], the mediant chord can take several forms. In [[major scale]]s, the mediant chord is minor and is noted with the [[Roman numeral]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;iii&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In a [[natural minor scale]], the mediant occurs as a [[major chord]], noted with the [[Roman numeral]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;III&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In [[harmonic minor]] scales and ascending [[melodic minor]] scales, the seventh scale degree is raised by a half-step from a [[subtonic]] to a [[leading tone]], creating an [[augmented chord|augmented mediant chord]], noted with the [[Roman numeral]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;({{music|b}})III&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

For example, in the C [[major scale]] (white keys on a piano, starting on C), the mediant is the note E; and the mediant [[chord (music)|chord]] is E-minor consisting of the notes E, G, and B.  Therefore, Em is the iii chord in the C major scale.  Also, in the A natural [[minor scale]] (same white keys, but now starting on A), the mediant is the note C; and the mediant chord is C (or C-major) consisting of the notes C, E, and G.  Therefore, C is the III chord in the A (natural) minor scale. However, if the harmonic minor scale is used, G would be raised to G{{music|#}}, changing the C chord to Caug, consisting of the notes C, E, and G{{music|#}}. Therefore, Caug is the III&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; chord in the A harmonic minor scale.

&amp;quot;Mediant&amp;quot; also refers to a relationship of musical [[key (music)|keys]]. For example, relative to the key of A (natural) minor, the key of C major is the mediant, and often serves as a mid-way point between I and V (hence the name). [[Tonicization]] or [[Modulation (music)|modulation]] to the mediant is quite common in pieces written in the minor mode, and usually serves as the second theme group in [[sonata form]]s, since it is very easy to tonicize III in minor (no need to alternate notes). Tonicization of III in major is quite rare in classical harmony, compared with, say, modulation to the [[dominant (music)|V]] in major, but mediant tonicization in major is an important feature of late [[romantic music]].

In German theory derived from [[Hugo Riemann]] the mediant in major is considered the [[dominant parallel]], Dp, and in minor the [[tonic parallel]], tP.
