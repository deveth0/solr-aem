&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;CSS &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Scorpion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Squib class torpedo boat|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Squib&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-class torpedo boat]] procured late in 1864 by the [[Confederate States Navy]] and armed with a [[spar torpedo]] fitted to her stem. She performed picket duty in the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] under command of Lieutenant E. Lakin, CSN.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;hazegray&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

On January 23 to January 25, 1865, torpedo boats
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Scorpion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, {{Ship|CSS|Hornet||2}} and {{Ship|CSS|Wasp||2}}, under the overall command of Lieutenant [[Charles Read (naval officer)|Charles W. Read]], CSN, joined Flag Officer J.K. Mitchell&amp;apos;s [[James River Squadron]] in the abortive attack on General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]&amp;apos;s main supply base at [[City Point, Virginia]]. Attempting to rejoin her consort, the ironclad {{Ship|CSS|Richmond}}, ran aground above Trent&amp;apos;s Reach, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Scorpion&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ended up fast ashore also and was severely damaged by the magazine explosion which destroyed nearby gunboat {{Ship|CSS|Drewry}}, on January 24.  Abandoned, she fell into Federal hands.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;hazegray&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
