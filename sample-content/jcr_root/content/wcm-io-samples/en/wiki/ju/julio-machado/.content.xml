{{spanish name|Machado|Rondón}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Julio Segundo Machado Rondón&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (December 1, 1965 in [[San Carlos del Zulia]], [[Venezuela]]) is a former [[Major League Baseball]] right-handed [[relief pitcher]] who played for the [[New York Mets]] (1989–90) and [[Milwaukee Brewers]] (1990–91).

Machado started his career with the Mets. In the {{By|1990}} season, he went to the Brewers in a four-player deal, along with [[pitcher]] [[Kevin Brown (left-handed pitcher)|Kevin Brown]], in exchange for [[catcher]] [[Charlie O&amp;apos;Brien]] and a [[minor league baseball|minor league]] player.

Machado had a decent [[fastball]], good control and willingness to challenge hitters. He also pitched a better-than-average [[curveball]] and a [[slider]]. Machado was certainly good enough to pitch for a few more years. However, he is a footnote in the ledger of baseball history. Spending the 1991 off-season in his homeland, Machado was arrested for murder being accused of shooting a woman following an auto accident. He was convicted and, following appeals, Machado was sentenced to 12 years in 1996.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fO4bAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=AFMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=2686,4153158&amp;amp;dq=julio+machado+murder&amp;amp;hl=en | title=Ex-pitcher sentenced | publisher = The Dispatch | date=1996-08-16}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In a three-year career, Machado posted a 7–5 record with 151 [[strikeout]]s and a 3.12 [[earned run average|ERA]] in 147 [[innings pitched|innings]].

Machado went on to play in the Venezuelan winter league and currently coaches in that league.
