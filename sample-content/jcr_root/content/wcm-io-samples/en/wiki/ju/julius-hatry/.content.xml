&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Julius Hatry&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (December 30, 1906 - November 7, 2000) was a [[Germany|German]] [[aircraft]] [[designer]] and builder. He is remembered for his contributions to [[sailplane]] development in the early twentieth century and for building the world&amp;apos;s first purpose-built rocket plane, the [[Opel RAK.1]].

Hatry was born in [[Mannheim]] and developed an early interest in aviation, joining the Mannheim flying club in 1922. With the club, he became a frequent visitor to the annual [[gliding]] competitions held at the [[Wasserkuppe]] during the 1920s. Between 1927 and 1928 he assisted in the construction of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Kakadu (sailplane)|Kakadu]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (then the largest sailplane ever built) with the [[Munich]] [[Akafleig]] (student flying) group.

References from [[Alexander Lippisch]] and [[Oskar Ursinus]] helped him gain his first design contract, for a [[motor glider]] which never actually flew due to problems with its powerplant. His association with Lippisch also allowed him to participate in the 1928 rocketry experiments carried out for [[Fritz von Opel]]. This led to von Opel commissioning him to build him a rocket plane for a public demonstration the following year.

He worked in civil engineering as [[Germany]] was rebuilt after the devastation of [[World War II]].

From 1982 until his death, he was active in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Luft- und Raumfahrt]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (German Society for Air and Spaceflight - DGLR), an aerospace research and advocacy group.
