&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Juan Carlos Zabala&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; -aka: &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;El [[Ñandú]]  Criollo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;-  (October 11, 1911 &amp;amp;ndash; January 24, 1983) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Athletics (sport)|athlete]], winner of the [[Marathon (sport)|marathon race]] at the [[1932 Summer Olympics]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Rosario]], Juan Carlos Zabala played [[Football (soccer)|football]] and [[basketball]] and did some [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], before he met his future coach [[Alexander Stirling]] in 1927.

Zabala ran his first marathon at the end of October, 1931. Ten days later he ran a new [[world record]] in 30&amp;amp;nbsp;km (1:42:30.4). Later, before the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], Zabala would run a new world record in 20&amp;amp;nbsp;km (1:04:00.2).

Zabala&amp;apos;s high peak was the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[Olympic Games|Olympics]]. Zabala ran in the leading group almost the entire distance. With just four kilometres to run, he broke free to finish 20 seconds ahead of [[Sam Ferris]] from Great Britain. Zabala also participated at the [[Berlin]] Olympics, gaining sixth place at the 10,000 m, but couldn&amp;apos;t defend his Olympic Champion title at the marathon race. Zabala got the lead from the start, but abandoned the race after 33&amp;amp;nbsp;km when the main group caught him.

Juan Carlos Zabala died in [[Buenos Aires]], aged 71.
