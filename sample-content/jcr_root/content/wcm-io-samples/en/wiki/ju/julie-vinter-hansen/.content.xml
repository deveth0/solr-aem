        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Julie Marie Vinter Hansen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (20 July 1890 – 27 July 1960) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[astronomer]].

Vinter Hansen was born in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]].  While studying at the [[University of Copenhagen]], she was appointed a computer at the University&amp;apos;s observatory in 1915.  In the pre-electronic era, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;computers&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were humans that worked doing hand calculations at the direction of astronomers.  She was the first woman to hold an appointment at the University.  She was later appointed observatory assistant and, in 1922, observer.  She was a very energetic worker, who, along with her normal work of observing and performing mathematical reductions of observations took on the task of editing the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nordisk Astronomisk Tidsskrift&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Nordic Astronomy Review).  She later became Director of the [[International Astronomical Union]]&amp;apos;s telegram bureau and Editor of its Circulars.

By 1939, Vinter Hansen was the First Astronomer at the Observatory of the University of Copenhagen, widely known for her accurate computation of orbits of [[minor planets]] and [[comet]]s.  In that year, she received the [[Tagea Brandt Rejselegat]] (travel award), and with the award money undertook a tour through the United States to Japan and back.  On her return trip in 1940, the outbreak of [[World War II]] restricted her homeward journey.  She was awarded a [[Martin Kellogg Fellowship]] at the [[University of California]] which allowed her to work for a time in the United States.  Also in 1940 she was awarded the [[Annie J. Cannon Award in Astronomy]].

Vinter Hansen was appointed to a knight in the [[Order of the Dannebrog]] in 1956&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/597/bio/1527/origin/170/ |title=Julie Vinter Hansen (1890 - 1960)
