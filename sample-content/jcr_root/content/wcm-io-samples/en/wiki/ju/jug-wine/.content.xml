&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jug wine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a term in the United States for inexpensive [[table wine]] (or &amp;quot;bulk wine&amp;quot;) typically bottled in a glass [[Jug (container)|jug]].

Historically, jug wines were labeled [[semi-generic]]ally, often sold to third parties to be relabeled, or sold directly from the [[winery]]&amp;apos;s [[tasting room]] to customers who would often bring their own bottles.&amp;lt;ref name=chron&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/03/WIUK11F2OD.DTL#|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|title=A jug full of tradition:Wine Country vintners serve up wines straight from the barrel|author=Tara Duggan|date=2008-07-04}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  For a period following Prohibition, jug wines were the only domestic wine available for most Americans.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/dining/chi-uncork_jug_7nov07,0,7929197.column|publisher=Chicago Tribune|title=Jug-heads:Retro charm of big bottles still appeal to some|author=Bill Daley|date=2007-11-07}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Beginning in the 1960s, when Americans began to consume more premium wine, jug wine took on a reputation for being &amp;quot;extreme value&amp;quot; (bargain-priced premium wine).&amp;lt;ref name=chron/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Julia Flynn Siler: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The House of Mondavi: The Rise and Fall of an American Wine Dynasty&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, page 310.
