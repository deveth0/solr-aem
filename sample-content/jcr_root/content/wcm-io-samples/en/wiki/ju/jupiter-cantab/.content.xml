        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jupiter Cantab Limited&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Cambridge]] based [[home computer]] company. Its main product was the 1983 [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] based [[Jupiter Ace]].

The company was founded in 1982 by two ex-[[Sinclair Research]] staffers, [[Richard Altwasser]] and [[Steve Vickers (academia)|Steven Vickers]]. Their machine was, externally, remarkably similar to the [[ZX Spectrum]], with a copycat rubber keyboard. It also used the same [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor. However, the Ace&amp;apos;s video output was limited to  monochrome, unlike the Spectrum&amp;apos;s 8 colour capability.

The Â£90 Ace was a flop in both the UK and US markets: the Forth language, although considered powerful, was not as popular or accessible as the already well-established BASIC language featured in competing microcomputers. In the US it was sold as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ace 4000&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The company went bankrupt in November 1983 and its assets were sold to [[Boldfield Computing|Boldfield Computing Ltd]] in 1984. The remaining hardware was sold-off into 1985.
