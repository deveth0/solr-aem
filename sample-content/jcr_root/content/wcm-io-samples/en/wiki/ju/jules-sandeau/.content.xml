&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Leonard Sylvain Julien (Jules) Sandeau&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 19, 1811 – April 24, 1883) was a [[France|French]] [[novelist]].

Sandeau was born at [[Aubusson, Creuse|Aubusson]] ([[Creuse]]), and was sent to [[Paris]] to study [[law]], but spent much of his time in unruly behaviour with other students. He met [[George Sand]], then Madame Dudevant, at Le Coudray in the house of a friend, and when she came to Paris in 1831 they had a relationship. The intimacy did not last long, but it produced &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rose et Blanche&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1831), a novel written together under the pseudonym J. Sand, from which George Sand took her famous [[pseudonym]].

Sandeau continued to produce novels and plays for nearly fifty years. His major works are:
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marianna&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1839), in which he draws a portrait of George Sand
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Le Docteur Herbeau&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1841)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Catherine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1845)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mademoiselle de la Seiglière&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1848), a successful picture of society under [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]], dramatized in 1851
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Madeleine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1848)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;La Chasse au roman&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1849)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sacs et parchemins&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1851)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;La Maison de Penarvan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1858)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;La Roche aux mouettes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1871)

The famous play, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Le Gendre de M. Poirier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is one of several which he wrote in collaboration with [[Émile Augier]]—the novelist usually contributing the story and the dramatist the theatrical form. Sandeau&amp;apos;s novels were less popular than his plays.

Sandeau had been made conservateur of the Mazarin library in 1853, elected to the [[Académie française]] in 1858, and appointed librarian of St Cloud in 1859. At the suppression of this latter office, after the fall of the [[Second French Empire]], he was pensioned.

Jules Sandeau died in Paris in 1883 and was buried in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]].
