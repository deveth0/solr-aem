        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Juilliard String Quartet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[classical music]] [[string quartet]] founded in 1946 at the [[Juilliard School]] in New York.  The original members were violinists [[Robert Mann]] and Robert Koff, violist [[Raphael Hillyer]], and cellist [[Arthur Winograd]]; Current members are Joseph Lin and Ronald Copes violinists, violist Samuel Rhodes, and cellist [[Joel Krosnick]].  In 2010 Nick Eanet resigned from the Quartet because of health issues and was replaced by [[Joseph Lin]] in 2011. Former second violinist, later first after Mann&amp;apos;s retirement, Joel Smirnoff left the quartet after its 2008-2009 season to become president of the [[Cleveland Institute of Music]]. Since the Quartet&amp;apos;s inception in 1946, it has been the quartet-in-residence at the Juilliard School.  It has received numerous awards, including four [[Grammy Awards|Grammys]] and membership in the National Academy Recording Arts and Sciences’ Hall of Fame. In February 2011, the Juilliard Quartet received the NARAS Lifetime Achievement Award for its outstanding contributions to recorded classical music.

The quartet plays a wide range of classical music, and has recorded works by composers such as [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], and [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], while also promoting more contemporary composers such as [[Elliott Carter]], [[Ralph Shapey]], and [[Milton Babbitt]].  It has performed with other noted musicians such as [[Aaron Copland]], [[Yo-Yo Ma]], and [[Maurizio Pollini]] and also (in its earlier days) with the famous scientist [[Albert Einstein#Love_of_music|Albert Einstein]]. They have participated on the soundtrack of [[Immortal Beloved (film)|Immortal Beloved]] movie.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{imdb title|0110116|Immortal Beloved}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The quartet began recording with [[Sony Classical]] (formerly [[Columbia Records]] and [[CBS Masterworks]]) in 1949, and the group&amp;apos;s discography currently numbers over 100 items, including repertoire well-traveled and unfamiliar. In 1950 the quartet made the first of at least three appearances at the [[Peabody Mason Concerts]] in Boston.  At that performance they made a world performance premiere of Martin Boykan&amp;apos;s String Quartet of 1949.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boston Herald&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 13-Apr-1950, Rudolph Elie, &amp;quot;Juilliard Quartet&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Their early 1950s recordings of the six Bartok string quartets on the Columbia Records label and various works recorded for the RCA Living Stereo label (c. 1958-1962) are particularly acclaimed.
