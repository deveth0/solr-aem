[[Image:Jules Lemaître - Project Gutenberg eText 17662.jpg|thumb|Jules Lemaître, pictured towards the end of his life.]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;François Élie Jules Lemaître&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (27 April 1853 – 4 August 1914) was a [[France|French]] [[critic]] and [[dramatist]].

Lemaître was born in [[Vennecy]], [[Loiret]].  He became a professor at the [[University of Grenoble]] in 1883, but was already well known for his [[literary criticism]], and in 1884 he resigned his position to devote his time to literature. He succeeded [[Jean-Jacques Weiss]] as drama critic of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Journal des Débats]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and subsequently filled the same office on the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. His literary studies were collected under the title of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Les Contemporains&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (7 series, 1886-1899), and his dramatic feuilletons as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;impressions de théàtre&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (10 series, 1888-1898).

His sketches of modern authors show great insight and unexpected judgment as well as gaiety and originality of expression. He published two volumes of [[poetry]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Les Médaillons&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1880) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Petites orientales&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1883); also some volumes of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;contes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, among them &amp;apos;&amp;apos;En marge des vieux livres&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1905). His plays are:
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Révoltée&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1889)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Le député Leveau&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Le Mariage blanc&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1891)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Les Rois&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1893)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Le Pardon&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;L&amp;apos;Age difficile&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1895)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;La Massière&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1905)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bertnade&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1906)

He was admitted to the [[French Academy]] on 16 January 1896. His political views were defined in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;La Campagne nationaliste&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1902), lectures delivered in the provinces by him and by [[Jacques Marie Eugène Godefroy Cavaignac|Godefroy Cavaignac]]. He conducted a nationalist campaign in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Écho de Paris]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and was for some time president of the [[Ligue de la Patrie Française]], but resigned in 1904, and dedicated the rest of his life to writing.  He died in [[Tavers]], aged 61.
