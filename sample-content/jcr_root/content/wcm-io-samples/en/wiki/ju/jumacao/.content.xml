&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jumacao&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; a.k.a. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jumaca&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;c&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. 1480s) was the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] [[Cacique]] (Chief) of the area in [[Puerto Rico]] named after him (now spelled [[Humacao, Puerto Rico|Humacao]]).

==Before and after the arrival of the Conquistadors==
The Tainos, who lived in Puerto Rico long before the arrival of the [[Spaniards]], were an organized and peaceful people.  The only problems they had were occasionally with the [[cannibals]] of the [[Carib people|Carib]] tribes.  The Cacique was the head of the tribe and the governor of his region. They reported to the &amp;quot;Supreme Cacique&amp;quot;, who during Jumacao&amp;apos;s time was the Cacique [[Agüeybaná (The Great Sun)|Agueybana]].  When the Spaniards arrived, Agueybana received [[Juan Ponce de Leon]] with open arms. This extended friendship was soon to end because the [[Conquistadores]] started to enslave the Tainos and to destroy their way of life.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;AA&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;El agua del paraíso (Spanish Edition)&amp;quot;; by: Benito Pastoriza Iyodo; Publisher: Xlibris (April 21, 2008); ISBN 1-4363-2567-6; ISBN 978-1-4363-2567-7&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Taino revolt==
[[Image:Jumacao.JPG|150px|left|thumb|Statue of Cacique Jumacao]]
According to the &amp;quot;Chronicles of the Indias&amp;quot;, which are kept in [[Seville, Spain]], in February 1511, Agueybana&amp;apos;s brother Güeybaná, better known as [[Agüeybaná II]] (The Brave), Urayoan, the Cacique of [[Añasco, Puerto Rico|Añasco]] and some of their men drowned the Spanish soldier [[Diego Salcedo (soldier)|Diego Salcedo]].  They watched over Salcedo&amp;apos;s body to see if he came back to life.  When he did not, the Tainos realized that the Spaniards were not [[Deity|god]]s after all.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;AA&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

When the news spread among the Tainos, they started a rebellion and attacked some Spanish settlements. After Ponce de Leon&amp;apos;s troops killed the Cacique Agueybana II, the Spanish Government reached an agreement and signed a peace treaty. However, the Spaniards in the island did not respect the treaty and continued to enslave and destroy many of the Taino villages.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;MPR&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Moon Puerto Rico (Moon Handbooks); Suzanne Van Atten (Author);  Publisher: Avalon Travel Publishing; Second Edition edition; ISBN 1598801821; ISBN 978-1598801828&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;WTH&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Alchemist: Webster&amp;apos;s Timeline History, 50 - 2007; Icon Group International (Author) ; Publisher: ICON Group International, Inc.

The Cacique Jumacao was the first Cacique to learn how to read and write in Spanish. He proved this by writing a letter to King [[Charles I of Spain]], complaining that the appointed governor of the island was not honoring the peace treaty and that he and the other Caciques had virtually become prisoners of the governor.  He also stated that he was responsible of his own acts.  The King was moved by the letter and ordered the governor to honor the terms of the treaty.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;AA&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

The government, however, paid no attention to the King&amp;apos;s request and continued to abuse the Tainos.  Jumacao, together with the help of the Cacique Daguao (Cacique of [[Naguabo, Puerto Rico|Naguabo]]), attacked Spanish settlements and burned down the City of Santiago (founded in 1513), which was located close to the Daguao (now Santiago) River, killing all of its inhabitants.  According to the testimony of Ignacio Martinez, the sole survivor of the &amp;quot;Santiago incident&amp;quot;, the Caciques and their tribes hid in the Sierras (mountains) of [[Luquillo, Puerto Rico|Luquillo]]. Jumacao was never heard from again.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;AA&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Legacy==
There is a statue of the Cacique in the city of Humacao.  In 1975 the city of Humaco honored the Cacique Jumacao by including a crown within its Municipal Coat of Arms, which represents the royalty of the Cacique.  The City of Humacao also presents the &amp;quot;Cacique Jumacao Award&amp;quot; to the best industries in regard to its recycling programs.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;MPR&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;WTH&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
