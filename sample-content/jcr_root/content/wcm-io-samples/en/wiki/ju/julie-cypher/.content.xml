&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Julie Cypher&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 24 August 1964 in [[Wichita, Kansas]]) is best known as the former partner of [[Melissa Etheridge]].

Cypher attended the [[University of Texas at Arlington]]. She married actor [[Lou Diamond Phillips]] in 1986. In 1988, Cypher met Etheridge while assisting on the music video for the song, &amp;quot;[[Bring Me Some Water]]&amp;quot; and split with Phillips in 1990 to embark on a relationship with Etheridge.

In 1995 she directed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Teresa&amp;apos;s Tattoo]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The film stars [[C. Thomas Howell]], [[Lou Diamond Phillips]], [[Melissa Etheridge]], [[k.d. lang]], and [[Kiefer Sutherland]].

Famous for being one half of one of the first publicly lesbian celebrity couples, Cypher advocated for [[gay rights]].&amp;lt;ref name=newsweek&amp;gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/1996/11/03/we-re-a-family-and-we-have-rights.html &amp;quot;We&amp;apos;re A Family and We Have Rights,&amp;quot; Newsweek, November 4, 1996]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 1995 she and Etheridge appeared in a &amp;quot;We&amp;apos;d Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur&amp;quot; poster campaign for [[PETA]].&amp;lt;ref name=poster&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=AmMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;amp;lpg=PA70&amp;amp;ots=7QlV8FiE1F&amp;amp;dq=julie%20cypher%20PETA%20poster&amp;amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=julie%20cypher%20PETA%20poster&amp;amp;f=false &amp;quot;Poster ad,&amp;quot; retrieved 2/8/11.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
During her partnership with Melissa Etheridge, she gave birth to two children, a daughter, Bailey Jean, born in February 1997, and a son, Beckett, born November 1998. Although initially reluctant to discuss it, the couple eventually revealed that the father of both children was friend and [[rock music]]ian [[David Crosby]].&amp;lt;ref name=CNN&amp;gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0305/24/pitn.00.html &amp;quot;Profiles of Melissa Etheridge, Margaret Cho&amp;quot;]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;CNN People in the News&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
