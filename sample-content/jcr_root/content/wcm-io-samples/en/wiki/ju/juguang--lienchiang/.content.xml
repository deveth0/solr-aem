[[File:Lienchiangadm.PNG|thumb|right|Juguang is located in the south of the [[Matsu islands]]]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Juguang&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Zh|t=莒光鄉|p=Jǔguāng|w=Chü³-kuang²}}; [[Foochow Romanized]]: Gṳ̄-guŏng-hiŏng), also spelled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chukuang&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a [[Townships of the People&amp;apos;s Republic of China|township]] of [[Lienchiang County]], [[Republic of China]]. Juguang Township includes two major [[Matsu (island)|Matsu]] islands -- [[Dongju Island]] (東莒 &amp;quot;East Ju&amp;quot;; Dĕ̤ng-gṳ̄) and [[Xiju Island]] (西莒 &amp;quot;West Ju&amp;quot;; Să̤-gṳ̄) -- and some islets. Neither Dongju nor Xiju has an island-wide administrative level.

==Administration==
Administratively the islands are part of the [[Matsu Islands|Lienchiang County]].

Both islands have villages as the first-level division within:

* Xiju Island
** Qingfan Village (青帆村 Qīngfán)
** Xiqiu Village (西坵村 Xīqīu)
** Tianwo Village (田沃村 Tiánwò)
* Dongju Island
** Daping Village (大坪村 Dàpíng)
** Fuzheng Village (福正村 Fúzhèng)

==History==
Dongju and Xiju Islands were previously named Dongquan (東犬; Dĕ̤ng-kēng) and Xiquan (西犬; Să̤-kēng) Islands, meaning &amp;quot;Eastern Dog&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Western Dog&amp;quot; respectively. They have also been called the Baiquan Islands (白犬島; Băh-kēng-dō̤) or Baiken Islands (白肯島).

They were renamed from a quote of a speech by [[Chiang Kai-shek]], &amp;quot;forget not that you&amp;apos;re in Ju&amp;quot; (毋忘在莒; Ù uông câi Gṳ̄). It refers to the City of Ju, where the king of [[state of Qi|Qi]] prepared a counterattack that retook his country from the [[State of Yan]]. This is an [[analogy]] of Matsu and Taiwan as bases of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) to regenerate itself and one day recover [[mainland China]] from the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese communist]].

The islands were originally part of the [[Changle|Changle County]] before the ROC government evacuate to Taiwan. It is considered by the [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China]] government as part of [[Changle|Changle City]] of the [[Fuzhou|Fuzhou City]].

==Geography==
Dongju, the southernmost of the Matsu Islands, is 2.63&amp;amp;nbsp;km² and Sijyu 2.36&amp;amp;nbsp;km². Islets includes like Yongliu (永留嶼 Yongliu) near Dongju.

There is one accessible seaport on Xiju, and two on Dongju. Dongju is shaped like a [[dagger]], while Xiju a [[triangle (geometry)|triangle]], so seemingly bigger on maps.

Some cliffs of Dongjyu is severely corroded by [[wind]], creating a strangely aesthetic appearance.

==Tourism==
The 19.5-metre (54-step) lighthouse on northern Dongjyu, made during the late [[Qing Dynasty]] with granite. The guiding light is in the shape of a [[clam]] and can reach {{Convert|16.7|nmi|km|1}}. Dongju Lighthouse is a second-level national historic building.  In front of the lighthouse, there used to be four mist-cannon for signaling, but has now been removed and placed in the Cultural Museum of Matsu History (馬祖歷史文物館 Matsu Lishi Wenwuguan).

The 42-[[Chinese character|character]] Dapu Stone Inscription (大埔石刻), in Dapu Seaport of Dongju, was made during the Wanli era of the [[Ming Dynasty]], concerning the capture of [[pirate]]s alive. Remembering-the-Past Pavilion (懷古亭 Huaigu Ting) was constructed in 1966 sheltering the stone.

In the sea south of the Sijyu, there is Snake Mountain (蛇山). The main island has a small Green-sail Seaport (青帆港), two water reservoirs and a [[middle school|middle]]-[[elementary school]], but are not major tourist attractions.
