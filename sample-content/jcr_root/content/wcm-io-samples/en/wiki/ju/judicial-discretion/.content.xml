        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Judicial discretion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the power of the [[judiciary]] to make some legal decisions according to their [[discretion]]. Under the doctrine of the [[separation of powers]], the ability of [[judge]]s to exercise discretion is an aspect of [[judicial independence]]. Where appropriate, judicial discretion allows  a judge to decide a legal case or matter within a range of possible decisions.

However, where the exercise of discretion goes beyond constraints set down by [[legislation]], by [[binding precedent]], or by a [[constitution]], the court may be abusing its discretion and undermining the [[rule of law]].  In that case, the decision of the court may be [[ultra vires]], and may sometimes be characterized as [[judicial activism]].

Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] wrote the following on this subject:

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;Judicial power, as contradistinguished from the power of the laws, has no existence. Courts are the mere instruments of the law, and can will nothing. When they are said to exercise a discretion, it is a mere legal discretion, a discretion to be exercised in discerning the course prescribed by law; and, when that is discerned, it is the duty of the court to follow it. Judicial power is never exercised for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the judge, always for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the legislature; or, in other words, to the will of the law.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/22/738/case.html Osborn V. Bank of the United States]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 22 U. S. 738 (1824).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

Concerns with regard to [[recidivism]] and other [[law and order (politics)|law and order]] issues have led to the introduction of [[mandatory sentencing]] laws which significantly limit judicial discretion in sentencing, particularly in the United States.
