        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Juris Podnieks&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (December 5, 1950 &amp;amp;ndash; June 23, 1992) was a [[Latvia]]n [[film director]] and [[Film producer|producer]].

He graduated from the [[USSR|Soviet]] [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|VGIK]] film school in 1975 after which he started working at the [[Riga Film Studio]]. He became a director in 1979.

Podnieks&amp;apos; first film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cradle&amp;apos;&amp;apos; won an award at the [[Dok Leipzig]] festival. In 1981, his film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Brothers Kokar&amp;apos;&amp;apos; took the first prize at the [[Kiev]] Youth Festival. In the same year, his film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Constellation of Riflemen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; won honours in the 17th All State Festival in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and the Latvian [[Komsomol]] prize. This film gave Podnieks wide recognition within the [[Soviet Union]].

Podnieks gained international recognition with his movie &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Vai viegli būt jaunam?|&amp;apos;Is It Easy to Be Young?]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The film with dialogue in both [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] was an exploration of Soviet youth, in which Podnieks  talked to youngsters later convicted for criminal actions. The movie broke box-office records in the Soviet Union.

As the Soviet Union collapsed, Podnieks cooperated with British television to give a first-hand insight on the events in the Soviet Union. Over three years, Podnieks filmed a five-part documentary titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hello, do you hear us?&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It showed civil unrest in [[Uzbekistan]], survivors of the [[1988 Spitak earthquake]] in [[Armenia]], striking workers in [[Yaroslavl]] and former residents returning to [[Chernobyl]]. The first film in the series was awarded the [[Prix Italia]].

Later, Podnieks filmed movies that focused on the rise of [[Latvian independence movement#.22Third awakening.22 .281986-1991.29|national identity]] in Latvia, [[Lithuania]] and [[Estonia]]. His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Homeland&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an account of [[Singing Revolution|folk festivals]] in these countries when national songs which had been banned by the Soviet regime for 50 years, were sung by massed choirs. While filming a follow-up  in January 1991, Podnieks and his crew came under sniper fire during the [[The Barricades|attempted coup]] by Soviet forces in [[Riga]]. Podnieks was beaten up, his cameraman and long-time friend [[Andris Slapiņš]] was killed and [[Gvido Zvaigzne]], another collaborator and friend of Podnieks, died of injuries.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.balticsworldwide.com/keep_filming.htm &amp;quot;Keep Filming&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;City Paper&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This was captured on video and shown as an addition to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Homeland&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and later as an introduction for the revised version of this film.

Four of his films received the [[Lielais Kristaps]] prize as the best documentary of the year.

Juris Podnieks drowned on 23 June 1992 while scuba-diving in a lake in  Courland.
