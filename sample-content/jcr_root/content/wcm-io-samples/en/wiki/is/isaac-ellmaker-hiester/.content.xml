        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Isaac Ellmaker Hiester&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1824â€“1871) was an [[United States|American]] political leader of the nineteenth Century. He was a member of the [[Hiester Family]] political dynasty. He was the son of [[William Hiester]] and cousin of [[Hiester Clymer]].

Hiester was born in [[New Holland, Pennsylvania]] in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]] on May 29, 1824. He attended Yale College (now [[Yale University]]) where he helped to found the [[Scroll and Key]] society, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1845. He began a successful law practice in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].

In 1848, he was elected Deputy [[District Attorney]] for Lancaster County and held the post until 1851. In 1852, he successfully ran for a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]] as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]]. He was defeated for reelection in 1854 because his opinions on slavery were at odds with his constituency. He again ran unsuccessfully in 1856. He returned to his law practice and in 1868 served as a delegate to the [[Democratic National Convention]].

He died in Lancaster, Pennsylvania on February 6, 1871.
