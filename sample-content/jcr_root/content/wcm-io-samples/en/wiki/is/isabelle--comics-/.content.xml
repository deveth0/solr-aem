&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Isabelle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a  [[Belgian comics|Belgian comic]] series drawn by [[Will (comics)|Will]] and written by [[Franquin]], [[Yvan Delporte|Delporte]] and [[Macherot]].

The comic first appeared in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1970. Created by a top team of already-famous contributors to the magazine, the series gained a small but fanatical following. The first stories were written by Franquin (of [[Gaston Lagaffe]] fame), Delporte (editor of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Spirou&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and writer of many comics) and Macherot (creator of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sybilline (comics)|Sybilline]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). Later, Delporte alone wrote the stories in collaboration with Will. Twelve [[comics album|albums]] were published until the series ended with Will&amp;apos;s death in 2000.

==Plot==
The little girl Isabelle (named after Franquin&amp;apos;s daughter) gets into a lot of adventures when the evil witch Calendula troubles Isabelle&amp;apos;s uncle Hermès and his fiancée, the good witch Calendula (who is the descendant of the evil Calendula). Other stories are about a magical painting, a flying village or a floating island.

The stories have a poetical tone, although mixed with tons of jokes and puns, rhyming ghosts, a talking diamond and Isabelle&amp;apos;s down-to-earth aunt –  whose greatest concern when Isabelle gets into an adventure is whether she&amp;apos;s dressed warmly enough, even when she descends into [[Hades]]. The drawings are packed with details and the poetic nature of the stories comes through in the imaginative animals and backgrounds.

==Reprints==
All the stories have recently been reprinted in three omnibus editions by [[Le Lombard]].
