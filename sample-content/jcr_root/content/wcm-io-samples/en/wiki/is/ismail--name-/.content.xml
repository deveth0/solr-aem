==Etymology and meaning==
The literal translation of the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ismail&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;heard by Allah&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;God has heard&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and it refers to the yearning of [[Abraham|Ibrahim]] and his wife, [[Sarah]], to have a child. [[Islamic view of Ishmael|Ismail]]&amp;apos;s mother, [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]] was the handmaiden of the Princess. [[Muhammad]], a descendant of [[Islamic view of Ishmael|Ismail]] who was sent the [[Qur&amp;apos;an]] by [[Allah]], became the final messenger, and so the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ismail&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is often taken to mean &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the fulfillment of a divine promise resulting from prayer being heard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
