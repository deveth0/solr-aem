&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Israel Pickens&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (January 30, 1780 – April 24, 1827) was an [[United States|American]] politician and lawyer, [[List of Governors of Alabama|third]] [[Governor of Alabama|Governor]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alabama]] (1821–1825), member of the [[North Carolina Senate]] (1808–1810), and North Carolina Congressman in the [[United States House of Representatives]] (1811–1817).

==Biography==
Born in [[Concord, North Carolina]], Pickens graduated from Jefferson College (now [[Washington &amp;amp; Jefferson College]]) in 1802, studied law and was admitted to the bar.

After serving as Governor, he was appointed to the [[United States Senate]] to fill the vacancy left by the death of [[Henry H. Chambers]]. He only served from February 17 to November 27, 1826, when the elected successor, [[John McKinley]], took office.

In addition to politics, Pickens participated in the [[American Colonization Society]] and was interested in [[scientific research]]. He invented a lunar dial.

Pickens died in [[Matanzas]], [[Cuba]] in 1827. He was originally buried in a family graveyard but his remains were later moved to City Cemetery, [[Greensboro, Alabama]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web
