[[File:Tydeus Ismene Louvre E640.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Tydeus]] and Ismene, [[Corinth]]ian black-figure [[amphora]], ca. [[560s BC|560 BC]], [[Louvre]] (E 640).]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ismene&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-grc|Ἰσμήνη}}, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ismênê&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is the name of two women of [[Greek mythology]]. The more famous is a daughter and half-sister of [[Oedipus]], daughter and granddaughter of [[Jocasta]], and sister of [[Antigone]], [[Eteocles]], and [[Polynices]]. She appears in several plays of [[Sophocles]]: at the end of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Oedipus the King]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Oedipus at Colonus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  She also appears at the end of [[Aeschylus]]&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Seven Against Thebes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

When [[Oedipus]] stepped down as King of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], he gave the kingdom to [[Eteocles]] and [[Polynices]], who both agreed to alternate the throne every year.  However, after the first year, Eteocles refused to step down and Polynices attacked Thebes with his supporters (the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Seven Against Thebes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). Both brothers died in the battle. [[Creon|King Creon]], who ascended to the throne of Thebes, decreed that Polynices was not to be buried, but left to rot on pain of death.

However, Antigone defied the order and was caught. In the opening scene of the play when Antigone is about to perform the burial rituals on Polynices, Ismene serves as the compassionate but rational and prudent counterpart to Antigone&amp;apos;s headstrong style of decision-making with no regard for consequence.  While Antigone resolves to honor her brother at all costs, Ismene laments that while she too loves her brother, her disposition does not allow her to defy the state and become an outlaw. Once Antigone was caught, in spite of her betrothal to his son [[Haemon]], Creon decreed that she was to be buried alive. Ismene then declared she had aided Antigone and wanted the same fate, though she did not participate in the crime. Antigone refused to let her be martyred for a cause she did not stand up for. She even seems to forget her sister exists, calling herself the &amp;apos;last descendant of Oedipus.&amp;apos;{{cn|date=October 2012}}

Thus, it is apparent that Ismene serves as a foil for Antigone; she is the “compliant citizen” to her sister’s “conscientious objector.”&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Sophocles. 2004&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Sophocles. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Drama Classics: Antigone&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. McDonald, Marianne, trans. London: Nick Hern Books, 2004.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  While she is loyal and willing to die at her sister’s side, she does not make the same bold, defiant stand that Antigone does.  Like Haemon, she is a reasonable, sympathetic person whose fate is tied to the far more fanatical Antigone and Creon.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Sophocles. 2004&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

However, in Aeschylus&amp;apos; play, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Seven Against Thebes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Ismene and Antigone sing a funeral [[dirge]] together for both of their brothers.

The 7th century poet [[Mimnermus]] accounts that Ismene was murdered by [[Tydeus]]. No other Classical writer mentions the story, but the scene is represented on a 6th-century Corinthian [[Black-figure pottery|black-figure]] [[amphora]] now housed in the [[Louvre]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book | last = Easterling | first = P.

==Daughter of Asopus==
Ismene was also a daughter of the river-god [[Asopus]] by [[Metope (mythology)|Metope]]. The blue berries, near Thebes, was named for her, or for her brother.
