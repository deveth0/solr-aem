The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Islamic Movement of Kurdistan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kurdistan Islamic Movement&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is an [[Islamist]] group founded in 1979 by [[Uthman Abd-Aziz|Shaykh Uthman Abd-Aziz]] and several other [[Sunni]] mullahs who were all part of the non-political &amp;quot;Union of Religious Scholars&amp;quot; (Yaketi Mamostayani Ayni Islami). The party&amp;apos;s main support comes from in and around that town of [[Halabjah]]. In the region controlled by the Islamic Movement in Kurdistan, the party established its own infrastructure but did not seek to apply Sharia law. Sheikh Uthman Abd al-Aziz was appointed as a mufti (religious judge) by the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan.

In the 1992 [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] elections the party received 5.1% of the vote, the third largest after the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan|PUK]] and [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq|KDP]]. In 1993 the PUK ceded control of territory around Halabja, Tawella and Panjwin to the party after heavy fighting, and the party controlled Halabja from 1998 to 2000.

In 1998 al-Aziz moved to Irbil with a number of followers. After al-Aziz&amp;apos;s death in 1999 the leadership of the party passed to his brother Mullah [[Ali Abd al-Aziz Halabji]], who has his office in Halabjah.

Armed hostilities, which resulted in deaths were reported between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and Islamic Groups, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the [[Kurdistan Workers Party]], and the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party]]. The heaviest fighting began in September 2001, when a newly created Islamist group, the [[Ansar al-Islam]], seized control of some villages near the Iranian border and attempted to institute a strictly [[Islamist]] theocratic regime.

According to press and opposition reporting, the Ansar al-Islam attacked Patriotic Union of Kurdistan fighters near Halabjah, killing dozens of persons. Intermittent fighting between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and the Ansar al-Islam, and other Islamic groups continued until late November, when an agreement between those involved and the Iranian Government imposed a cease-fire.

Islamic Movement of Kurdistan holds  (2005) two ministerial posts in the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan-dominated government. This co-operation appears to be principally a temporary coalition dictated by pragmatic considerations. Islamic Movement is receiving aid from [[Iran]] and is also said to receive money from other Islamic countries. Islamic Movement of Kurdistan has offices in various towns in Northern Iraq, including [[As Sulaymaniyah Governorate|Suleimaniyya]] and [[Irbil]].

During the [[2010 Iraqi elections]] the party won some 40 thousand votes.[http://www.rudaw.net/english/kurds/5330.html]
