The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Borough of Islwyn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was one of five local government [[districts of Wales|districts]] of [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]] from 1974 to 1996.

The district was formed under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] from part of the [[administrative county]] of [[Monmouthshire]], namely the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s of [[Abercarn]], [[Mynyddislwyn]] and [[Risca]], and the [[Bedwellty]] urban district less the wards of [[Aberbargoed]], [[Cwmsyfiog]], [[New Tredegar]] and Phillipstown.

The district&amp;apos;s name (meaning &amp;quot;below the grove&amp;quot;) was derived from the ancient parish of Mynyddislwyn which covered its area. This was shown in the borough&amp;apos;s [[coat of arms]] which represented a mountain below a grove of oak trees. Islwyn was also the [[nom de plume]] of local poet [[William Thomas (Islwyn)|William Thomas]] (1832-1878).

The borough was abolished in 1996, when its area became part of [[Caerphilly County Borough]].

Islwyn continues as a [[Islwyn (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster constituency]] and a [[Islwyn (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Welsh Assembly constituency]].
