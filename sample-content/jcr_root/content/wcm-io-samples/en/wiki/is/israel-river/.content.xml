[[Image:IsraelRiver.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Israel River in [[Lancaster, New Hampshire]]]]
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Israel River&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also called &amp;quot;Israel&amp;apos;s River&amp;quot;) is a river in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of [[New Hampshire]].  It arises in the township of [[Low and Burbank&amp;apos;s Grant, New Hampshire|Low and Burbank&amp;apos;s Grant]] and runs 24 miles (38 km) generally northwest along [[U.S. Highway 2]], traversing the towns of [[Jefferson, New Hampshire|Jefferson]] and [[Lancaster, New Hampshire|Lancaster]], before joining the [[Connecticut River]].  It is named for an early hunter, trapper and surveyor of the area, Israel Glines. The [[Johns River (New Hampshire)|Johns River]], in the nearby town of [[Whitefield, New Hampshire|Whitefield]], is named for Israel&amp;apos;s brother John.

The Israel River rises near the foot of [[Mount Adams (New Hampshire)|Mount Adams]], at the juncture of Castle Brook and Cascade Brook.  With its numerous tributaries, the river drains the northwestern slopes of Mount Adams and [[Mount Jefferson (New Hampshire)|Mt. Jefferson]] in the [[Presidential Range]], the northern slopes of the [[Dartmouth Range]], and the southern slopes of the Pliny Range.  The larger tributaries include the [[South Branch Israel River|South Branch]], The Mystic, Castle Brook, Cascade Brook, Stag Hollow Brook, Stanley Brook, Priscilla Brook, Alder Brook (also called Crawford Brook), Red Brook, Mill Brook, Garland Brook (which still turns a working saw mill) and Otter Brook.

Major highway bridges over the river include [[New Hampshire Route 115]], [[U.S. Highway 2]] and [[New Hampshire Route 115A]] in Jefferson, and [[U.S. Highway 3]] on Main Street in Lancaster.  A number of smaller bridges are provided for [[snowmobile]] trails, and there is an old [[covered bridge]] on Mechanic Street in Lancaster (closed in 2004 for major repairs and since reopened).
