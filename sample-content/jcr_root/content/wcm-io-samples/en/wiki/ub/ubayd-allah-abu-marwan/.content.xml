&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ubayd Allah&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Lang-ar|عبيد الله}}), known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Abu Marwan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Lang-ar|أبو مروان}}), was a general in the service of [[Emir]] [[Abd ar-Rahman II]] of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]. He was an uncle of the Emir [[Al-Hakam I]].

In 826, [[Aissó]] revolted and requested help from Abd ar-Rahman, who sent the general Abu Marwan. The army arrived in [[Zaragoza]] in May 827. From there Aby Marwan&amp;apos;s forces passed into territory of the [[county of Barcelona]], reaching Barcelona in the summer. It besieged Barcelona without success, ransacking the city&amp;apos;s environs. Abu Marwan then moved on to [[Girona]], which he occupied on October 10, 827. The [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Louis the Pious]], knowing of the Muslim raid, ordered his son [[Pepin I of Aquitaine]] and the counts [[Hugh of Tours]] and [[Matfrid of Orléans]] to recruit an army, but the recruitment was slow and by the time it was formed, Abu Marwan and his army had returned to Muslim territory. The rebels abandoned the country with them (827).
