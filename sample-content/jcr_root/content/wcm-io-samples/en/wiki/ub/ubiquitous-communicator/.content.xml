The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ubiquitous Communicator&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;UC&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[mobile computing device]] designed for the use in [[ubiquitous computing]] by [[Ken Sakamura]], the creator of [[TRON Project|TRON]] and a leading [[Japan]]ese [[Computer science|computer scientist]] in [[Tokyo University]]. The device is based on [[T-Engine]].

== History ==
On September 15, 2004, [[YRP-UNL]] announced in Japan that it has started the production of a new model after creating five [[prototype]]s over three years. The model was used in trial tests circa late 2004. The new model (weighing about 196 [[gram]]s) contains new features: [[RFID]] reader compatible for [[ucode system|ucode]], a 2 [[megapixel]] [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] [[camera]], a secondary 300 000 pixel [[camera]] for [[Videophone|video phone]], support for [[wireless network]] technologies, [[Bluetooth]], [[Wi-Fi]], and [[IrDA]], [[VoIP]] [[VOIP Phones|phone]] feature, [[SD memory card|SD]] and [[mini-SD memory card slot]], [[fingerprint authentication]] and [[encryption]] [[co-processor]] as option. It was expected to be sold for three hundred thousand [[Japanese yen|yen]] (twenty seven hundred dollars).
