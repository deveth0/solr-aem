&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kumrovec&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] in the northern part [[Croatia]], part of [[Krapina-Zagorje County]].

Kumrovec&amp;apos;s claim to fame is that it is the birthplace of marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] (1892–1980), the president of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]]. The birth house of Tito (built in 1860 as the first brickwork house in the village) features the Memorial Museum of Marshal Tito, opened in 1953. The Museum is also important for the local folklore. Next to the house is the bronze standing statue of Marshal Tito (made by [[Antun Augustinčić]], 1948). The old part of Kumrovec comprises the Ethnological Museum with 18 village houses, displaying permanent exhibitions of artifacts related to the life and work of Zagorje peasants in the 19th/20th century.
The village is small but was of great popularity in the former Yugoslavia.

Today the major attraction of Kumrovec is the Ethnological Museum Staro Selo (Old Village) Kumrovec with very well preserved village houses from the turn of 19th/20th century. The reconstruction and redecoration of these houses started in 1977. So far 40-odd houses and other farm-stead facilities have been restored, which makes Staro Selo the most attractive place of this kind in Croatia. Visitors may see permanent ethnological exhibitions such as the [[Zagorje]]-style Wedding, the Life of Newly-weds, From Hemp to Linen, Blacksmith&amp;apos;s Crafts, Cart-wright&amp;apos;s Craft, Pottery, From Grain to Bread, etc.
