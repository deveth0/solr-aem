&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kurd Lasswitz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-de|link=no|Kurd Laßwitz}}, {{IPA-de|ˈkʊʁt ˈlasvɪt͡s|IPA}}; 20 April 1848 – 17 October 1910) was a German author, scientist, and philosopher. He has been called the father of German science fiction&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;German SF&amp;quot; by [[Franz Rottensteiner]], in:
[[Neil Barron]] ed, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anatomy of Wonder&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Third Edition. New York: Bowker, 1987. pp.379–404. &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He sometimes used the pseudonym &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Velatus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

== Biography ==
Lasswitz studied mathematics and [[physics]] at the [[University of Breslau]] and the [[University of Berlin]], and earned his doctorate in 1873. He spent most of his career as a teacher at the [[Gymnasium Ernestinum]] in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]].

== Works ==
His first published science fiction story was &amp;quot;Bis zum Nullpunkt des Seins&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;To the Zero Point of Existence&amp;quot;, 1871), depicting life in 2371, but he earned his reputation with his 1897 novel [[Two Planets]], which describes an encounter between humans and a [[Mars|Martian]] civilization that is older and more advanced. The book has the Martian race running out of water, eating synthetic foods, travelling by rolling roads, and utilising space stations. His spaceships use [[anti-gravity]], but travel realistic orbital trajectories, and use occasional mid-course corrections in travelling between Mars and the Earth; the book depicted the technically correct transit between the orbits of two planets, something poorly understood by other early science fiction writers. It influenced [[Walter Hohmann]] and [[Wernher von Braun]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} The book was not translated into English until 1971 (as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Two Planets]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and the translation is incomplete). A story from Lasswitz&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Traumkristalle&amp;apos;&amp;apos; served as the basis for [[The Library of Babel]], a short story by [[Jorge Luis Borges]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Borges, Jorge Luis, and Eliot Weinberger. &amp;quot;The Total Library&amp;quot; in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Selected Non-Fictions&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. New York: Penguin Books, 1999, pp.215–216.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

His last book was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sternentau: die Pflanze vom Neptunsmond&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Star Dew: the Plant of Neptune&amp;apos;s Moon&amp;quot;, 1909). He is also known for his 1896 biography of [[Gustav Fechner]].

A [[Impact crater|crater]] on [[Mars]] was named in his honour, as was the [[asteroid]] [[46514 Lasswitz]].

There also is a [[Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis]], an award for German-speaking authors of science fiction since 1981.
