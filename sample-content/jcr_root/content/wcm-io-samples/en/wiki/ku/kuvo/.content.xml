Licensed to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]], KUVO began operations on August 29, 1985.

The station also carries selected [[National Public Radio|NPR]] and other syndicated programs such as: [[Marian McPartland]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Piano Jazz]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Riverwalk Jazz]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, hosted by Jim Cullum; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jazz from Lincoln Center&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, hosted by [[Wynton Marsalis]]; and [[Dee Dee Bridgewater]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jazz Set&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
