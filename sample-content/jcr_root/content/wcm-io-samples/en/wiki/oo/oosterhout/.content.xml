&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oosterhout&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{pronunciation|215 Oosterhout.ogg}}; from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ooster&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;eastern&amp;quot;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;hout&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;woods&amp;quot;) is a [[municipality]] and a city in the southern [[Netherlands]].

==History==
Oosterhout is mentioned for the first time in 1277, although archaeological excavations showed the existence of human settlements in the area in prehistoric times. The [[Knights Templar]] had a temple here dedicated to St. John the Baptist. It was home to a castle which later acquired control over the surrounding area, up to [[Breda]] and [[Bergen op Zoom]]. The castle was destroyed by Spanish troops during the [[Eighty Years War]], in 1573; only a tower of it survives today.

The city became the seat of a flourishing ceramics industry, which lasted until the 19th century. In 1625 the city was besieged by [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange]], and suffered heavy damage.

Despite the rise of Protestantism, it was home to several Catholic monasteries, including that of the [[Premonstratensian]]s, which is still active. Oosterhout received [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] in 1809, by will of [[Louis Bonaparte]].
