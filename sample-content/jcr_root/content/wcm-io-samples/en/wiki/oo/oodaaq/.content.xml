        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oodaaq&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oodap Qeqert&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[bank of gravel]] and silt northeast of [[Greenland]] that has been considered by some to be the [[Extreme_points_of_Earth#Latitude_and_longitude|most northerly point of land]] on earth.

==Location==
Oodaaq lies at {{Coord|83|40|N|30|40|W|display=inline,title|type:isle}}, only 705 km&amp;lt;!--was wrong, likely misconverted from &amp;quot;miles&amp;quot; by somebody who didn&amp;apos;t know what those &amp;quot;miles&amp;quot; were--&amp;gt; south of the [[North Pole]] and 1,360 metres&amp;lt;!--is this also a misconversion from &amp;quot;miles&amp;quot; as the other number was?--&amp;gt; north of [[Kaffeklubben Island]], lying near the northeast tip of Greenland. When discovered it measured a mere 15 metres by 8 metres.

It was discovered in 1978 when a Danish survey team led by Uffe Petersen landed a [[helicopter]] on Kaffeklubben Island to confirm that it did indeed lie further north than the tip of Greenland. Having confirmed the fact, a member of the team spotted a dark spot to the north and they flew over to the bank, naming it Oodaaq after the [[Eskimo]] who accompanied [[Robert Peary]] on his historic journey to the North Pole.

Gravel banks such as this are generally considered not to qualify for the title of world&amp;apos;s most northerly point of land as they are rarely permanent. In fact several subsequent expeditions have claimed that Oodaaq has now disappeared beneath the ocean.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

A number of other locations have since been called the northernmost point. In July 2001, the Return to the Top of the World Expedition, led by Theresa Baker, John Jancik, and Ken Zerbst, came to the conclusion that the previously-discovered island and permanent land feature [[ATOW1996]] is the northernmost point of land on earth.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book | author=Jancik, John; Richardson, Javana; &amp;amp; Gardiner, Steve | title=Under the Midnight Sun: The Ascent of John Denver Peak and the Search for the Northernmost Point of Land on Earth | publisher=Stars End Creations | year=2002 | isbn=1-889120-19-7}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In July 2003 American explorers led by [[Dennis Schmitt]] found [[83-42|a 35-metre-long bank at 83°42&amp;apos;N]]. Debate continues as to whether the bank is permanent. In late 2004, the Eighth Edition of the [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] World Atlas was released. It clearly shows Oodaaq as the northernmost landmass on Earth. In July 2007, [[Dennis Schmitt]] discovered a &amp;apos;new&amp;apos; northernmost island on Earth at 83°40&amp;apos;30&amp;quot; N (named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stray Dog West&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by Holly Wenger).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stray Dog West&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([http://cache.daylife.com/imageserve/07cZ0QT0I55pU/610x.jpg photograph] taken on 2007-07-16) belongs to a shifting, semi-permanent archipelago locked in the sea ice north of Peary Land in northeast Greenland, named the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Stray Dog Islands&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
