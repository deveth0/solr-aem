        text="&lt;p&gt;*Delete. Vanity. Google returns 34 hits for &amp;quot;No Conscription leagues&amp;quot; -- [[User:Chris 73|Chris 73]] | ([http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Chris_73&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;section=new New]) [[User talk:Chris 73|Talk]] 03:00, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*I disagree that this page is vanity.  It is insufficient as is, but could be better.  If anything, it just needs to be reworked, and taken beyond 1 or 2 sentences.  Thinking of Canadian context, it could include some of the protests following mandatory conscription in Quebec.
**Unsigned objection don&amp;apos;t get counted.  I agree with Alcarillo below, redirect.  [[User:RickK|Rick]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[User talk:RickK|K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] 22:11, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Redirect to [[conscientious objector]], seeing how there&amp;apos;s insufficient info here. [[User:Alcarillo|Alcarillo]] 07:15, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*&amp;lt;s&amp;gt;Definitely not vanity.  I believe the title should be &amp;quot;No Conscription League&amp;quot;, which gets 130 google hits, or possibly &amp;quot;No Conscription&amp;quot;, for which google hits are probably meaningless.  Also note this is linked from [[Emma Goldman]].  I&amp;apos;d would say merge with [[Emma Goldman]] and redirect unless expanded, but the fact that &amp;quot;leagues&amp;quot; isn&amp;apos;t capitalised makes me think maybe there is a generic term as well.  But a redirect to [[conscientious objector]] would be confusing.  So delete unless expanded.&amp;lt;/s&amp;gt; Expanded.  No vote.

*&amp;lt;s&amp;gt;First, not vanity. Second, protests against conscription are covered in [[Conscription Crisis]]. Redirect there. [[User:Andris|Andris]] 22:31, May 1, 2004 (UTC)&amp;lt;/s&amp;gt;
*I rewrote it, with more details. Let&amp;apos;s keep the new version. [[User:Andris|Andris]] 22:47, May 1, 2004 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;" />
