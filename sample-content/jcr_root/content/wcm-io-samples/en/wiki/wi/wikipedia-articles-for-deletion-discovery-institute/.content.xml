&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is an archive of the discussion surrounding the proposed deletion of a page entitled [[Discovery Institute]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Further comments should be made on the [[Talk:Discovery Institute|talk page]] rather than here as this page is kept as an historic record.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The result of the debate was to keep the page.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

====[[Discovery Institute]]====
Advert.  Original author signed with &amp;quot;shameless plug for evolution&amp;apos;s chief foe.&amp;quot;  If he meant [[Intelligent Design]], there is a full article for that already.  If he meant the Discovery Institute, this is nothing more than an advertisement.  Either way, this article should become an external link at the bottom of the Intelligent Design page.[[User:SWAdair|SWAdair]] | [[User talk:SWAdair|Talk ]] 05:32, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)

*Think tanks certainly can merit their own articles.  Keep--it&amp;apos;s got a Senator on the board, and I&amp;apos;ve actually heard some of their fellows&amp;apos; names. [[User:Meelar|Meelar]] 06:08, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*Keep. I&amp;apos;ve made it more neutral and added a Stub flag. (FWIW, Sen Gorton lost his last Senate election). [[User:Niteowlneils|Niteowlneils]] 06:34, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*Niteowl, I think you&amp;apos;re headed in the right direction.  When I first found this page it was nothing more than an advertisement (this exists, visit the web page).  If it could be fleshed out more, I would be in favor of keeping.  Examples: [[CATO Institute]] and [[http://www.nira.go.jp/ice/nwdtt/dat/1267.html|NIRA]].[[User:SWAdair|SWAdair]] | [[User talk:SWAdair|Talk ]] 07:29, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*I&amp;apos;m in favor of keeping it right now. Let&amp;apos;s move it to cleanup for fleshing out [[User:Theresa knott|theresa knott]] 11:25, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*Keep. [[User:DJ Clayworth|DJ Clayworth]] 14:09, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*Keep. Legitimate topic, just needs work. [[User:Pollinator|Pollinator]] 14:38, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Definite concensus.  I&amp;apos;ve moved it to cleanup and removed the VfD notice from the page.  I&amp;apos;ll leave this up for 24 hours so everyone can see it, then remove this entry from VfD entirely.[[User:SWAdair|SWAdair]] | [[User talk:SWAdair|Talk ]] 10:48, 24 Mar 2004 (UTC)
