*Keep. Cleanup. [[User:Anthony DiPierro|anthony]] [[User:Anthony_DiPierro/warning|(see warning)]] 21:46, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*I wish people would stop putting US Supreme Court opinions on the page varbatim. Transwiki and if anyone&amp;apos;s up for it, a brief summary on the &amp;apos;pedia page. &amp;lt;s&amp;gt;For now, delete&amp;lt;/s&amp;gt;. [[User:Pteron|Pteron]] 00:56, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Looks like source material. [[User:Dori|Dori]] | [[User talk:Dori|Talk]] 01:14, Apr 20, 2004 (UTC)
**There&amp;apos;s nothing wrong with source material which can be edited. [[User:Anthony DiPierro|anthony]] [[User:Anthony_DiPierro/warning|(see warning)]]
***Yes there is - see [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not]], point 14. [[User:Pteron|Pteron]] 02:48, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* &amp;lt;s&amp;gt;Delete.  Considering how Supreme Court opinions are freely available on the web, nothing is gained by just moving them here.  When someone is ready to write an article on this case, they&amp;apos;ll be able to easily find the source material elsewhere.  [[User:Postdlf|Postdlf]]  6:22 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)&amp;lt;/s&amp;gt;
*Source material. Delete. [[User:DJ Clayworth|DJ Clayworth]] 14:39, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)

*Keep. Overwrote source material with stub. Please revisit [[Roth v. United States]]. -- [[User:Zigger|Zigger]] 16:43, 2004 Apr 20 (UTC)
**Yeah, it&amp;apos;s ok now. Keep. [[User:Pteron|Pteron]] 21:57, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Keep.  Changed vote now it&amp;apos;s an actual article rather than pure source.  [[User:Postdlf|Postdlf]] 22:30 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Keep revision. [[User:Cribcage|Cribcage]] 05:41, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;" />
