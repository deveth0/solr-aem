* Delete.  Non-famous, seems to be a vanity page, and is orphaned. [[User:Jacob1207|Jacob1207]] 18:36, 3 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Delete. Well-researched genealogy... but still non-famous. [[User:Ashibaka|Ashibaka]] [[User talk:Ashibaka|&amp;amp;#9998;]] 19:06, 3 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Keep. May be useful to someone. Not vanity, as far as I can see. [[User:80.255|80.255]] 14:41, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Marginal case. I lean towards deletion.  The article is uninformative except to someone searching for geneaological information, which is not part of our mission. [[User:UninvitedCompany|UninvitedCompany]] 04:01, 10 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*delete, see [[Wikipedia:What_wikipedia_is_not#What Wikipedia entries are not |no 17]]. Subject is nonfamous. --[[User:Jiang|Jia]][[User talk:Jiang|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ng&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] 06:53, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;" />
