&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is an archive of the discussion surrounding the proposed deletion of the page entitled [[The Last Married Couple in America]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is kept as an historic record.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The result of the debate was to keep the article.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Some IP tagged this article with a VfD tag, but hasn&amp;apos;t listed it here. Originally it was just a data dump of the cast/crew credits. I have replaced that with a stub (short--I don&amp;apos;t think I saw the movie, and IMDB and rottentomatos.com don&amp;apos;t have much info). I think it should be kept, but I don&amp;apos;t believe I have the right to arbitrarily remove the VfD tag, so I&amp;apos;m listing it here.

*Agreed.  Keep and expand.  Why would this have been listed for deletion in the first place, I wonder? - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 17:45, 12 May 2004 (UTC)
::Check the history--the original entry was capital U ugly. [[User:Niteowlneils|Niteowlneils]] 18:03, 12 May 2004 (UTC)
:::Ugh.  Kiddy-Wiki.  I see what you mean. - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 18:58, 12 May 2004 (UTC)

*Good Lord. Grudingly keep. Who knows? The fate of Planet Earth may hang in the balance if an article about some B comedy was deleted... [[User:Alcarillo|Alcarillo]] 17:52, 12 May 2004 (UTC)
*Keep - disk space is cheap.  Writing a stub to replace a poor or nonsense article often consumes less [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]] time than VfDing it.  Good job, do it early and often. - [[User:Topbanana|TB]] 18:24, 12 May 2004 (UTC)
**I agree. Ever since I added [[Special:Newpages|New Pages]] patrol to the mix, I&amp;apos;ve had many more &amp;quot;opportunities&amp;quot; to do just that. :/ [[User:Niteowlneils|Niteowlneils]] 01:52, 13 May 2004 (UTC)
*Keep. Stublike but encyclopedic, will expand as soon as anyone is interested enough to add a synopsis and see whether any of the other credits are otherwise notable. I&amp;apos;ve copied the removed text to the talk page, it may be useful to later editors, they may not find it in the history and in any case it&amp;apos;s a courtesy. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 20:41, 12 May 2004 (UTC)
**Thanks. I didn&amp;apos;t know that was common practice. [[User:Niteowlneils|Niteowlneils]] 01:52, 13 May 2004 (UTC)
***Comment: It&amp;apos;s not as common as it once was! It used to be very staunchly defended once. We&amp;apos;ve got friendlier and less legalistic by my observation, and I think that&amp;apos;s good. But at least we should be aware of when removed text may be useful later, and IMO when in doubt it&amp;apos;s good to put it in. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 09:02, 13 May 2004 (UTC)
*Keep as it has real info if slightly esoteric [[User:Burgundavia|Burgundavia]] 06:23, May 13, 2004 (UTC)
*Keep, it&amp;apos;s been apropriately stubbified. --[[User:Starx|Starx]] 13:29, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
*Keep and improve with plot bits. [[User:Jfdwolff|JFW]]&amp;amp;nbsp;|&amp;amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Jfdwolff|&amp;lt;small&amp;gt;T@lk&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;]] 20:35, 17 May 2004 (UTC)
*You know you&amp;apos;re not famous anymore when your linked name comes up in red. Too bad, [[Richard Benjamin]]. And we so loved ye once, lad. Keep, for old times sake. [[User:Dwindrim|Denni]] 06:11, 2004 May 18 (UTC)
