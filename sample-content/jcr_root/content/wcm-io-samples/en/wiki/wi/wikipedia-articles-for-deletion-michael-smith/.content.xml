*With a name this common it&amp;apos;s a little hard to be sure, but this smells of vanity. All this user [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;amp;target=24.91.40.11 24.91.40.11] ever writes about is this guy and things related to his bands. Someone better stop him. He&amp;apos;s creating a whole network around this guy and his bands. Entering them in [[2000s]] as major entertainers, creating a host of bad identical articles (not even good redirects) about caricaturists with just a link to Michael Smith etc. Delete. [[User:Pteron|Pteron]] 04:40, 12 May 2004 (UTC)
* And to think I almost voted to keep this.  Delete. - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 04:42, 12 May 2004 (UTC)
* Keep. It&amp;apos;s got a good beat and [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22figures+on+a+beach%22+Michael+smith&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search Google] can dance to it. It may need some NPOV, along with his other articles; I haven&amp;apos;t checked them all out yet. [[User:Alcarillo|Alcarillo]] 16:02, 12 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete vanity.  Wrong google search, Alcarillo.  Try [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q=%22figures+on+a+beach%22+%22Michael+Smith%22&amp;amp;btnG=Search this one], which gets only 24 hits (a good number of which are Wikipedia and its mirrors.)  This guy&amp;apos;s been playing a long time, but it doesn&amp;apos;t seem that he&amp;apos;s all that signficant. [[User:Isomorphic|Isomorphic]] 18:13, 12 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete: vanity. [[User:Wile E. Heresiarch|Wile E. Heresiarch]] 04:40, 13 May 2004 (UTC)
*Yup. Delete. [[User:Radicalsubversiv|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;R&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;adical&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;S&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ubversiv]] [[User talk:Radicalsubversiv|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;E&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] 00:25, 17 May 2004 (UTC)
