&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;William Markowitz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 8, 1907, [[Vítkov]], [[Austrian Silesia]] - October 10, 1998, [[Pompano Beach, Florida]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[astronomer]], principally known for his work on the [[standardization]] of [[time]].

His mother was visiting Melč, [[Vítkov (Opava District)|Vítkov]] in [[Austrian Silesia]] (now [[:cs:Melč]], Czech Republic) when William was born. The [[Polish people|Polish]] family emigrated to the [[United States|U.S.]] in 1910 and settled in [[Chicago]].

William earned his doctorate from the [[University of Chicago|university]] in 1931, under [[W.D. MacMillan]]. He taught at [[Pennsylvania State College]] before joining the [[United States Naval Observatory]] in 1936, working under [[Paul Sollenberger]] and [[Gerald Clemence]] in the time service department.

After having married Rosalyn Shulemson in 1943, Markowitz eventually became director of the department. He developed the [[ephemeris time]] scale, which had been adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] in 1952 on a proposal formulated by [[Gerald Clemence|Clemence]] in 1948,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;See references (incl. citations to some of Markowitz&amp;apos;s papers) in article [[Ephemeris time]].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; as an international time standard. He subsequently worked with [[Louis Essen]] in [[England]] to [[calibration|calibrate]] the newly developed [[atomic clock]]s in terms of the ephemeris second. The fundamental frequency of [[caesium]] atomic clocks, which they determined as 9,192,631,770 +/- 20 [[Hertz|Hz]], was used to define the [[second]] internationally since 1967. At the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) meeting in [[Dublin]] in 1955, he had proposed the system of distinguishing between variants of [[Universal Time]], as UT0 (UT as directly observed), UT1 (reduced to invariable meridian by correcting to remove effect of polar motion) and UT2 (further corrected to remove (extrapolated) seasonal variation in earth rotation rate), a system which remains in some use today.

He served as President of the IAU commission on time from 1955 to 1961, and was active in the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]], the [[American Geophysical Union]], and the [[International Consultative Committee for the Definition of the Second]].

After retirement in 1966, Markowitz served as professor of [[physics]] at [[Marquette University]] until 1972, and also held a post at [[Nova Southeastern University]].
