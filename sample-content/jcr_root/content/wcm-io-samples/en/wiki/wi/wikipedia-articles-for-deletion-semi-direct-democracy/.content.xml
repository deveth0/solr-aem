&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is an archive of the discussion surrounding the proposed deletion of the page entitled [[Semi-direct democracy]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is kept as an historic record.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The result of the debate was to redirect to [[Direct democracy]], after a merge was performed.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

* &amp;lt;s&amp;gt;Delete; The article is very light, only has one external link and the term itself is of questionable encyclopedic relevance.  There is &amp;quot;direct democracy&amp;quot; and there is &amp;quot;indirect democracy&amp;quot;, but &amp;quot;semi-direct&amp;quot;??  This delete vote should also apply to &amp;quot;Mediated direct democracy&amp;quot;, which redirects to this term. -- [[User:Stevietheman|Stevietheman]] 17:49, 14 May 2004 (UTC)&amp;lt;/s&amp;gt;
* &amp;lt;s&amp;gt;Merge with [[Direct democracy]] and redirect [[User:Kim Bruning|Kim Bruning]] 17:47, 14 May 2004 (UTC)&amp;lt;/s&amp;gt;
**Why?  What does one have to do with the other?  Delete.  [[User:RickK|Rick]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[User talk:RickK|K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] 06:13, 15 May 2004 (UTC)
*** Keep and research the subject better. If there&amp;apos;s people (like you ;-) ) who ask questions like that, then the article has at least some relevance. Comment: There are many [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;amp;target=Semi-direct_democracy links to the article]. So if we can&amp;apos;t keep, at least still redirect to prevent breaking links.  [[User:Kim Bruning|Kim Bruning]] 08:59, 15 May 2004 (UTC)
**** I&amp;apos;m not opposed to redirecting the term after its minimal contents are merged into [[direct democracy]]. So, my vote is slightly modified to &amp;lt;s&amp;gt;delete &amp;amp; &amp;lt;/s&amp;gt;redirect. -- [[User:Stevietheman|Stevietheman]] 15:19, 15 May 2004 (UTC)
* Keep. It seems a [http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;q=%22semi-direct+democracy%22++-%22liquid+democracy%22&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;meta= fairly well accepted term], much to my surprise, and is a good stub IMO. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 17:10, 15 May 2004 (UTC)
**The problem is that even though the term is being used in some documents searchable on Google, it has the smell of being &amp;quot;made up&amp;quot; to suggest there&amp;apos;s some kind of grey area where there&amp;apos;s not (and this is how some academic types pursue subjects in their drafting of papers).  I submit that instead there are &amp;apos;&amp;apos;degrees of direct democracy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, where some political mechanisms seek to mediate aspects of direct democracy to protect civil liberties.  This is almost always the design of any direct democracy mechanism.  Therefore, &amp;quot;semi-direct democracy&amp;quot; in no way expands upon the reality.  This is why I support a redirect.  A democratic system is either a kind of direct or a kind of indirect.
* Still redirect.  However, I&amp;apos;ve added the following blurb to [[direct democracy]] to hopefully take any sting out of a redirect.  In other words, this term &amp;quot;gets its props&amp;quot;.  I don&amp;apos;t think that establishment should guarantee a term its own article, if the term is only a very minor extension of another term. -- [[User:Stevietheman|Stevietheman]] 19:49, 15 May 2004 (UTC)
::Some political scholars use the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;semi-direct democracy&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to describe direct democracy systems that are mediated in some way to protect civil liberties as well as protecting [[minority]] interests from [[majoritarianism]].  However, since direct democracy mechanisms are almost always mediated in this way, this term suggests a [[grey area]] where there is most likely none.
*Comment: With the merger being complete, if there is no objection, I&amp;apos;d like to go ahead and do the redirect. -- [[User:Stevietheman|Stevietheman]] 16:21, 17 May 2004 (UTC)
