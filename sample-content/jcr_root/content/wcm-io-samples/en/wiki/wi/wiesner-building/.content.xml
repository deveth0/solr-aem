[[Image:Wiesner Building, MIT, Cambridge MA.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;Wiesner Building&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Wiesner Building&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] houses the [[MIT Media Lab]], the [[Center for Bits and Atoms]] ([[Neil Gershenfeld]]&amp;apos;s lab), the Department of Architecture&amp;apos;s Program in Art, Culture and Technology (ACT, formerly the Visual Arts Program), the [http://cms.mit.edu/ Comparative Media Studies] (CMS) program and the [[List Visual Arts Center]].  It was designed by [[I.M. Pei]] &amp;amp; Partners.  It is named in honor of former MIT president [[Jerome Wiesner]] and his wife Laya and was dedicated in 1985.

The Wiesner Building is also known to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] community as Building E15. The building&amp;apos;s exterior has a tile-like look which has been the target of a number of [[Hack (technology slang)|hacks]] (pranks) by MIT&amp;apos;s students.  Because of the sterile look of the tile, the building is sometimes referred to as the &amp;quot;Pei Toilet&amp;quot;.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
