&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Quickpolls&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were a trial of a system for making fast decisions about problematic users. They consisted of polls among Wikipedia regulars on issues that needed to be quickly resolved.  It operated from [[March]] to [[June]] of [[2004]], although some action continued into [[July]].

After mixed reactions in the 30-day review process this page fell into disuse. As seen on the [[Wikipedia talk:Quickpolls|talk page]], there was much dissatisfaction with the process, and no agreement on what changes were needed to fix it.

Potential alternatives to the quickpoll system include the &amp;quot;[[Wikipedia:Three strikes you&amp;apos;re out policy|three strikes rule]]&amp;quot; and other ways of [[wikipedia:dealing with trolls|dealing with trolls]] and [[Wikipedia:dealing with disruptive or antisocial editors|dealing with disruptive or antisocial editors]].

At the time, [[Wikipedia:Quickpolls policy]] contained the policy for this procedure. Concluded polls have been moved to [[Wikipedia:Quickpolls/Archive]] (which also includes an example poll).

A proposal to revive quickpolls was active in March, 2005. See [[Wikipedia:Bring back quickpolls]].&lt;/p&gt;" />
