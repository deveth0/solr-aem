&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wild haggis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Haggis scoticus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[fictional creature]] said to be native to the [[Scottish Highlands]].&amp;lt;ref name=NYT&amp;gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/britain/scotland/glasgow/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154683241450 Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum] in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[New York Times]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, accessed 9 February 2009&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=article/&amp;gt; It is comically claimed{{cn|date=January 2013}} to be the source of [[haggis]], a traditional Scottish dish that is in fact made from the innards of sheep (including heart, lungs, and liver).&amp;lt;ref name=guardian/&amp;gt;

According to some sources, the wild haggis&amp;apos;s left and right legs are of different lengths (cf. [[Sidehill gouger]] or [[Dahu]]), allowing it to run quickly around the steep mountains and hillsides which make up its natural habitat, but only in one direction.&amp;lt;ref name=article/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.mahalo.com/Haggis Haggis] at mahalo.com, accessed 9 February 2009&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is further claimed that there are two varieties of haggis, one with longer left legs and the other with longer right legs. The former variety can run clockwise around a mountain (as seen from above) while the latter can run &amp;lt;!-- per MOS please retain UK term anticlockwise, not US term counterclockwise --&amp;gt; anticlockwise.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usfeatures/haggis/wildhaggis.html Wild Haggis] at Undiscovered Scotland.co.uk, accessed 9 February 2009&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The two varieties coexist peacefully but are unable to interbreed in the wild because in order for the male of one variety to mate with a female of the other, he must turn to face in the same direction as his intended mate, causing him to lose his balance before he can mount her. As a result of this difficulty, differences in leg length among the haggis population are accentuated.&amp;lt;ref name=article&amp;gt;A. M. King, L. Cromarty, C. Paterson, J. S. Boyd, &amp;quot;[http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~s0681349/Haggis.pdf  Applications of ultrasonography in the reproductive management of Dux magnus gentis venteris saginati]&amp;quot; in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Veterinary Record&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 20 January 2007&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Haggis abroad==
The notion of the wild haggis is widely believed, though not always including the idea of mismatched legs. According to an online survey commissioned by haggis manufacturers Hall&amp;apos;s of Broxburn, released on 26 November 2003, one-third of U.S. visitors to Scotland believed the wild haggis to be a real creature.&amp;lt;ref name=guardian&amp;gt;John Carvel, &amp;quot;[http://travel.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,7445,1093930,00.html Majestic haggis of the glens proves elusive for US tourists]&amp;quot; in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Guardian]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Thursday 27 November 2003 02.18&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/11/26/1069825845544.html?from=storyrhs US tourists want to hunt wild haggis]&amp;quot; in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sydney Morning Herald]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 27 November 2003&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Influence on media==

In an episode of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[River Cottage]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the presenter, [[Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall]] goes hunting for these haggis creatures in his quest to find true haggis to cook. The convincing locals in the episode never reveal what a haggis actually is, leading the viewers to wonder if he believed them.{{cn|date=January 2013}}

In [[Scotland (Goodies episode)|an episode]] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the three main characters were visiting Scotland and captured a haggis to eat, shortly before having an encounter with a bagpipe spider.

In a part of one of [[Piers Anthony]]&amp;apos;s novels{{specify}}, a haggis is part of a challenge{{clarify|date=December 2012}} before entering the Good Magician&amp;apos;s castle.

In the [[Spearwielder&amp;apos;s Tales]] novels by [[R.A. Salvatore]], one of the dangers encountered by the hero is a &amp;quot;Wild Hairy Haggis&amp;quot;.
