Just a word invented on some Japanese BBS.  Not notable. [[User:Meelar|Meelar]] 18:49, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete.... I can&amp;apos;t even tell what the word is supposed to mean. --[[User:Starx|Starx]] 19:47, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete. [[Neologism]]. According to the article, the bulletin board on which it was created is only five years old itself. No [http://www.google.com.au/search?q=Wooriginal&amp;amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;amp;meta= Google] hits, surprisingly. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 20:14, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete.  [[User:RickK|Rick]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[User talk:RickK|K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] 20:53, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete - needs more support to be a justifiable article - [[User:Texture|T&amp;amp;#949;x]][[User Talk:Texture|&amp;lt;font color=red&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#964;&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;]][[User:Texture|ur&amp;amp;#949;]] 20:54, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete. The article is totally incoherent and the word is apparently a recently-forged [[neologism]]. [[User:DO&amp;apos;Neil|DO&amp;apos;Neil]] 21:27, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
* Um... what? Delete -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]]|[[User talk:Cyrius|&amp;amp;#9998]] 21:33, May 16, 2004 (UTC)
*Poorly-written, as well as a name that nobody not under the influence of drugs would look up. Delete.[[User:Beelzebubs|Beelzebubs]] 03:16, 17 May 2004 (UTC)
* Integrate into [[2ch]]. [[User:Ashibaka|Ashibaka]] [[User talk:Ashibaka|&amp;amp;#9998;]] 06:17, 17 May 2004 (UTC)
* Delete. - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 16:34, 17 May 2004 (UTC)
* I thought that the best solution is move this article to &amp;quot;List of 2ch-related terms&amp;quot; and arrange style (and POV) for a section. If do so, explanation of &amp;quot;Abone&amp;quot;(deletion), &amp;quot;Cap&amp;quot;(Identification mechanism), &amp;quot;Trip&amp;quot;(Self-Identification), and other 2ch-related words will be able to be added.
