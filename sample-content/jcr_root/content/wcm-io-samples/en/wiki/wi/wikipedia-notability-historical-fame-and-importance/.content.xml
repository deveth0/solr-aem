In 2004, there was no consensus that lack of &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;fame&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;importance&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; should be a legitimate reason to delete an article. There was much discussion of this question on [[Wikipedia talk:Importance|the talk page]]. In 2005, there is consensus that not establishing the importance of its subject &amp;apos;&amp;apos;is&amp;apos;&amp;apos; a legitimate reason to delete an article.  As of 2006, several topical notability guidelines have been incorporated into policy at [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy]], and the related guideline [[WP:N|Wikipedia:Notability]] was written and remains heavily debated.&lt;/p&gt;" />
