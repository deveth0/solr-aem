        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;William Chalmers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (13 November 1748 &amp;amp;ndash; 3 July 1811) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] merchant and [[freemason]]. He was born in [[Gothenburg]] in 1748 as the son of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] merchant, William Chalmers, Sr., and his Swedish wife, Inga Orre. William Chalmers Jr. was the oldest amongst his brothers James, George Andreas and Charles Chalmers.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chalmers.se/HyperText/Jubileum/william.htm |title= WILLIAM CHALMERS 1748-1811 |author= Mikael Carlsson |publisher= CHALMERS |accessdate= Jan 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He became a director of the [[Swedish East India Company]] and in 1783 he was appointed as their resident representative in [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. He would stay there and in [[Macau]] for ten years before returning home. He died in Gothenburg in 1811 leaving half his fortune to the [[Sahlgrenska University Hospital|Sahlgrenska hospital]], Gothenburg. After some other donations, the remainder was donated to create a crafting school for poor children,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url= http://chalmers.se/sv/om-chalmers/historia/Sidor/default.aspx|title=Historia|author= Jan Hult|accessdate= January 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; which in 1829 became a college, that today is named the [[Chalmers University of Technology]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalmers_University_of_Technology|title=Chalmers University of Technology|accessdate= January 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Education==
William Chalmers studied [[commerce|commercial]] &amp;amp; [[marketing]] in Gothenburg and United Kingdom, before continuing his studies in a travelling manner to France and Holland. At the age of 35, he was nominated to become the purchaser of the [[Swedish East India Company]] in [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[China]] which became his most enriching investment.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.foretagsamheten.se/Entreprenorer/Entreprenorer/William-Chalmers/|title= Direktören som grundade industriskola |publisher= Svenskt Näringsliv |accessdate= 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Swedish East India Company==
In 1793, when Chalmers was 45 years old, he had been living in Canton for ten years. Afterwards, he returned to [[Sweden]] as the manager of the [[Swedish East India Company]] as well as the manager of Trollhätte Kanalverk (a canal that runs through Trollhättan). He faithfully contributed to the finalization of the canal and was able to leave the company seven years later (1800). Six years post the finalization of the canal, the last [[Swedish East India Company]]-ship arrived into Sweden. On it were the trading merchandises from [[China]] and [[Spain]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.foretagsamheten.se/Svenska-foretag/Foretag/Ostindiska-kompaniet/|title= Gjorde expeditioner till Kina |publisher= Svenskt Näringsliv |accessdate= 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The importations from Spain and China allowed Sweden to widen its [[international relation]], thus the [[porcelain]] from China and the silver from Spain was exported to other countries, as well as Sweden&amp;apos;s own products; wood, iron and artillery.
