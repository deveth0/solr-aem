&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wild On!&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a travel show that was produced from 1997 until 2003 by [[E!]]. Each episode followed a celebrity host as they experienced the food, culture, and nightlife of a certain region.

==Overview==

Sometimes referred to as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wild on E!&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The series featured exciting travel destinations like Miami and Milan.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wild on!&amp;apos;&amp;apos; had three primary hosts over the years: [[Jules Asner]] (1997–1999), [[Brooke Burke]] (1999–2002), and [[Cindy Taylor]] (2002–2003).  The show also had a variety of guest hosts during its run, including models such as [[Victoria Silvstedt]], [[Jenna Jameson]], [[Tim Cheveldae]], [[Karen McDougal]] and [[Ashley Massaro]].  In the last few years, [[Art Mann]] provided comic relief as a co-host.

The E! broadcasts usually censored nudity, however rebroadcasts on the Canadian network [[Star!]], late night showings in E! Latino, and the Australian re-edit &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Naked Wild On!&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are uncensored.

==Cancellation==
The show&amp;apos;s ratings peaked during &amp;apos;The Brooke Burke Years&amp;apos;, but took a major dive when Brooke Burke left the show at the end of 2002.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The show originally was supposed to have a new season in 2005 with [[Tara Reid]] as the new host. However, a week before the start of the new season, E! changed the focus of the show based on the footage from Tara&amp;apos;s travels, and decided to reconfigure it as a reality program based around Tara traveling the world with her friends. The show&amp;apos;s title was then changed to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Taradise]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, with the [[Travel literature|travelogue]] format of the show dropped and the focus exclusively on Tara. The E! International network, broadcast out of the UK, shows &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Taradise&amp;apos;&amp;apos; under the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wild On Tara!&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Repeats of the program have since been discontinued because of E! buying more late-night programming from outside producers and the show&amp;apos;s age.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}
