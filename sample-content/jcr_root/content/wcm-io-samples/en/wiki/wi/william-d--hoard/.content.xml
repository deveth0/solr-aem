&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;William Dempster Hoard&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (October 10, 1836&amp;amp;ndash;November 22, 1918) was the [[List of Governors of Wisconsin|16th Governor]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]] from 1889 to 1891.

==Early life==
Born in [[Stockbridge, New York]], he moved to [[Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin|Fort Atkinson]], [[Wisconsin]]. During the [[American Civil War]], Hoard served in the [[4th Wisconsin Volunteer Regiment]] as a musician until he was discharged for medical reasons. He went back to New York to recover and served briefly in the 1st New York Artillery Regiment. Returning to Wisconsin, he got involved with the [[hops]] industry, but the glut and decline in the industry left him without money.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;amp;term_id=2246&amp;amp;keyword=hoard&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was a member of the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], but was an outsider and an amateur in politics.  He was a leading promoter of the dairy industry, through his weekly magazine &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hoard&amp;apos;s Dairyman]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.hoards.com/biographies | title = Hoard&amp;apos;s History | work = Hoard&amp;apos;s Dairyman – The National Dairy Farm Magazine | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/64FeZE16Y | archivedate = 2011-12-27}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Governor of Wisconsin==
In 1889, Hoard asked the legislature to pass the [[Bennett Law]], the state&amp;apos;s first compulsory school attendance law.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;amp;term_id=831&amp;amp;search_term=bennett&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It required all public and private schools to teach major subjects in English. The German Lutherans and Germans Catholics, who each had a large parochial school system that used German-speaking teachers, strenuously objected.  Hoard made the extremely controversial law the centerpiece of his reelection campaign, rejecting the advice of professional politicians that it would doom the GOP. The law, and Hoard, were repudiated by the state&amp;apos;s large German community. Hoard was defeated in an intense campaign by Democrat [[George Wilbur Peck]], the Yankee mayor of Milwaukee.

The Republican establishment was outraged at Hoard. In turn the moralistic rank and file bridled at the boss rule. Hoard joined forces with [[Robert M. LaFollette]] and created the Progressive faction of the state GOP. It propelled LaFollette to the governorship and the U.S. Senate, but Hoard, still an influential publisher, broke with La Follette in 1912.

==Legacy==
In honor of Hoard&amp;apos;s service to the dairy industry, a [[List of public art in Madison, Wisconsin|statue of Hoard]] by [[Gutzon Borglum]] was erected in 1922 at the head of Henry Mall of the [[University of Wisconsin&amp;amp;ndash;Madison]], which was the original quadrangle of the university&amp;apos;s [[University of Wisconsin–Madison College of Agricultural and Life Sciences|College of Agriculture and Life Sciences]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://news.cals.wisc.edu/newsDisplay.asp?id=257&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
