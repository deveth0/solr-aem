~Delete. Garbage - [[User:PedroPVZ|Pedro]] 01:35, 19 May 2004 (UTC)
*Keep. Over-condensed article, but not garbage. Or do you mean the software itself is garbage? [[User:Mikkalai|Mikkalai]] 20:29, 19 May 2004 (UTC)
*It seems Pedro loves to delete... but why Sacix would be garbage? &amp;apos;&amp;apos;(unsigned comment at 22:26, May 19, 2004 by User:Leandrod)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
**Really... you dont like people to touch your POV. Sacix is just an add. I&amp;apos;m amazed and not understanding why you didnt created an article about yourself. Or there is one? As we say, and ask, in Portugal &amp;quot;when an article about &amp;apos;santa cona dos assobios&amp;apos; will be written?&amp;quot; --[[User:PedroPVZ|Pedro]] 17:56, 22 May 2004 (UTC)
*I don&amp;apos;t know why I kept passing this by.  So I stopped, looked...and just kept looking at this article.  Frankly, I don&amp;apos;t know why this was put up for deletion.  There are even plenty of Wikis to back up the terminology.  Even if the software really is garbage, keep. - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 23:37, 19 May 2004 (UTC)
* The software is not garbage. its the article! Now wikipedia is a database of Software? -[[User:PedroPVZ|Pedro]] 23:55, 19 May 2004 (UTC)
* Yeah, the article could be better.  But it&amp;apos;s a pretty good stub about what seems to be an important project in one of the world&amp;apos;s largest cities.  There have been a lot of arguments lately about posting subroutines and Linux commands as articles.  Personally, I feel they don&amp;apos;t belong here.  This, IMO, does belong.  A little cleanup wouldn&amp;apos;t hurt, but I think it&amp;apos;s serviceable as is. - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 00:10, 20 May 2004 (UTC)
*Keep, and hope somebody builds on it. [[User:Dwindrim|Denni]] 00:23, 2004 May 25 (UTC)
