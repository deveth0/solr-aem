Vanity.  [[User:RickK|Rick]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[User talk:RickK|K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]]

*Keep Penn-Six, or move it to Pennsylvania Six-5000; it was referred to in [[Glenn Miller]]&amp;apos;s song, written by Carl Sigman. Delete GMS or merge it with P6-5000 [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 07:07, 15 May 2004 (UTC)
**Pennyslvania 6-5000 is a song.  Penn-Six is a choral group.  What does one have to do with the other?  [[User:RickK|Rick]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[User talk:RickK|K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] 07:09, 15 May 2004 (UTC)
***One could write about the song, and mention that the choral group was mentioned in the song. However, now that I think of it, if the group named themselves after the song, then delete... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 07:15, 15 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete both as vanity. - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 18:26, 15 May 2004 (UTC)
* Appears to be non-notable. Delete both. -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]]|[[User talk:Cyrius|&amp;amp;#9998]] 23:28, May 20, 2004 (UTC)
