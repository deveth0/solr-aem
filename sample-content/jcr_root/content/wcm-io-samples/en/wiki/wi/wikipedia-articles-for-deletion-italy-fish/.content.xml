Vanity (college group).  Delete.  [[User:SWAdair|SWAdair]] | [[User talk:SWAdair|Talk ]] 10:23, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)

*Delete. I could say why, but then I&amp;apos;d have to kill you. [[User:DJ Clayworth|DJ Clayworth]] 17:06, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Delete so&amp;apos;s we can fugheddabout it.  Capeesh? - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 21:46, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Delete; not notable. [[User:Psychonaut|Psychonaut]] 23:28, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Keep. Needs expanding, but this is about a definite [[subculture]] and not merely a &amp;quot;vanity group.&amp;quot; 04:37, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Delete. [[User:Maximus Rex|Maximus Rex]] 04:40, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Delete - there&amp;apos;s probably an Aggie joke to be made here. -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]]|[[User talk:Cyrius|&amp;amp;#9998]] 07:39, Apr 24, 2004 (UTC)
*Hmm... borderline.  I&amp;apos;m going to say &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;delete&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; because although they appear to be a legitimate subculture for a university, this is extremely localised to just one university. -- [[User:Francs2000|Graham  :)]] | [[User talk:Francs2000|Talk]] 21:37, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Delete. Wikipedia is not the Texas A&amp;amp;M Student Handbook. [[User:DragonflySixtyseven|DS]] 01:49, 29 Apr 2004 (UTC)
