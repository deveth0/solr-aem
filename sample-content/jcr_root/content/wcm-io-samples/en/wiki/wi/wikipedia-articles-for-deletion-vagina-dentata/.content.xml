While distasteful, it describes something from either a movie or a book.  I have deleted first person comments and left only the description of the &amp;quot;vagina dentata&amp;quot;.  - [[User:Texture|T&amp;amp;#949;x]][[User Talk:Texture|&amp;lt;font color=red&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#964;&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;]][[User:Texture|ur&amp;amp;#949;]] 18:56, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Keep&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; -- last paragraph should be all that remains; describes well-known legendary phenomenon or issue of psychic/psychological male worry.  --[[User:Daniel C. Boyer|Daniel C. Boyer]] 19:06, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Keep&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, adding truth that generated myth - [[User:UtherSRG|UtherSRG]] 19:27, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Keep&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; -- I have endeavoured to expand it.  I kept the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Snow Crash]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; bit, and added another tad of pop-culture fluff, and mentioned Uncle Sigmund.

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Keep&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as revised; it&amp;apos;s a well-known issue. &amp;amp;mdash;[[User:Psychonaut|Psychonaut]] 19:55, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Keep&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as revised (although the original was eminently deleteable). - [[User:Hephaestos|Hephaestos]]|[[User talk:Hephaestos|&amp;amp;#167;]] 19:57, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Keep&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Discussed many places, not just one book.[[User:Hyacinth|Hyacinth]] 04:30, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Keep. Bizarre, but interesting. [[User:Ronabop|Ronabop]] 11:59, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Keep, now that it&amp;apos;s been fixed. -[[User:Gtrmp|Sean]] 07:34, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Keep. Quite detailed now it&amp;apos;s fixed and important given the scarcity of psychoanalytic terms in Wikipedia. [[User:Pteron|Pteron]] 21:28, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Keep.  Wierd, but worthy. --[[User:Ssd|ssd]] 15:28, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Keep. Was planning to add an article about this myself someday, a little sad someone beat me to it. :) [[User:Bryan Derksen|Bryan]] 07:59, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;" />
