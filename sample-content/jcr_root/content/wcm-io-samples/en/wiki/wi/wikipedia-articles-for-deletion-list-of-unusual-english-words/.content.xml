        text="&lt;p&gt;This article is irreconciably POV. To move it to [[List of English words which some people hold to be unusual]] would be just plain stupid, and to leave it where it is would be to turn a blind eye to blatant POV. Plus, it isn&amp;apos;t even a proper list! - [[User:Node ue|Node]]

*Delete. - [[User:Node ue|Node]]
*Keep. Looks interesting to me. Maybe needs some formatting -- [[User:Chris 73|Chris 73]] | ([http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Chris_73&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;section=new New]) [[User talk:Chris 73|Talk]] 03:09, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Keep, more than just a list. Maybe find a better title, but good content. [[User:Everyking|Everyking]] 03:12, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Keep, but rename.  [[Words in the English language with unusual syntactic characteristics]]? Agh, that&amp;apos;s no good. Still, keep. -[[User:Gtrmp|Sean]] 04:02, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Perhaps change &amp;quot;unusual&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;irregular&amp;quot;. And if there is already an article on irregular words in English, redirect to that. [[User:WhisperToMe|WhisperToMe]] 04:39, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Keep. How about &amp;quot;Unsual English Words&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Uncommon English Words&amp;quot; for a title?  Maybe some are more common than others?
**To me, &amp;quot;Unusual English Words&amp;quot; is like if we had a page called &amp;quot;Most Beautiful French Women&amp;quot; where we had a list saying that &amp;quot;some people hold these women to be the most beautiful French women&amp;quot;. My whole point is that &amp;quot;most unusual&amp;quot; is irreconcilably POV. Perhaps if we were to take each individual section and move it to a new article, such as &amp;quot;Longest English word&amp;quot;, saying &amp;quot;The longest English word that can be found in ______ dictionary is ______. However, this word is not in common usage. The longest English word in everyday usage is ______. The longest English word in everyday usage that doesn&amp;apos;t repeat any letter is uncopyrightable&amp;quot; - the &amp;quot;longest&amp;quot; word is indeed a fact, whereas &amp;quot;unusual&amp;quot; is subjective. This is akin to saying &amp;quot;French women with the largest busts&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;French women with the ____est _____&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;The most beautiful French women&amp;quot;.[[User:Node ue|Node]]
***I see your point.  But I disagree.  An argument about &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;most beautiful&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; would be more hotly contested than a more similar argument: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;most unusual looking&amp;apos;&amp;apos; where we&amp;apos;d all probably agree that the ten with two heads had a significant claim (indeed, head and shoulders) above Marilyn Monroe.  The article does explain &amp;apos;&amp;apos;why&amp;apos;&amp;apos; they&amp;apos;re unusual: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;w as a vowel&amp;apos;&amp;apos; , &amp;apos;&amp;apos;6 consonant letters in a row&amp;apos;&amp;apos; etc.  Try doing that for beautiful women.  You can&amp;apos;t.  But &amp;apos;&amp;apos;unusual&amp;apos;&amp;apos; looking women: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Her eyes are in the backs of her knees&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - you can.
* The article is more a discussion of unusual properties of certain English words than a list of words that are unusual. As such, keep, but consider moving to a more appropriate title. -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]]|[[User talk:Cyrius|&amp;amp;#9998]] 06:47, Apr 30, 2004 (UTC)
*Keep.  Seems like quite an interesting collection. Obviously quite a lot of work has gone into it.  [[User:Ping|ping]] 07:56, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Keep. Fascinating and encyclopedic. Discuss the matter of a better name on its talk page. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 10:23, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Keep, but change the name.  [[Anomalies of the English language]], maybe?  [[User:RickK|Rick]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[User talk:RickK|K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] 22:19, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Keep [[User:Rmhermen|Rmhermen]] 23:45, Apr 30, 2004 (UTC)
*Keep [[User:Gadfium|Gadfium]] 00:18, 1 May 2004 (UTC). Note that I don&amp;apos;t think I&amp;apos;ve been here long enough to have my vote counted.
*Neutral.  But [[List of English words which some people hold to be unusual]] doesn&amp;apos;t need to be the title for that to be the subject of the list. [[User:Anthony DiPierro|anthony]] [[User:Anthony_DiPierro/warning|(see warning)]]
*Keep, but rename. Interesting subject. [[User:Philwelch|Philwelch]] 23:56, 1 May 2004 (UTC)
*I agree with a number of participants. The name doesn&amp;apos;t quite fit, but it&amp;apos;s just the kind of cool little article I like to find when I&amp;apos;m thumbing through an encyclopedia. It&amp;apos;s a little mind candy. They&amp;apos;re not unusual words so much as words with unusual features. Can someone take that further? [[User:Dwindrim|Denni]] 05:46, 2004 May 2 (UTC)
*Keep. In my opinion, we need these sorts of things to keep Wikipedia from becoming a badger&amp;apos;s onion. --[[User:SMWhat|SMWhat]] 03:38, 4 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete.  This material is essentially a bunch of linguistic trivia, not an encyclopÃ¦dia article.  Besides, it&amp;apos;s already better covered in other public sources, such as the rec.games.puzzles FAQs. [[User:Psychonaut|Psychonaut]] 19:03, 4 May 2004 (UTC)
*Keep.  Agree with Denni&amp;apos;s comments.--[[User:Bodnotbod|bodnotbod]] 00:47, May 5, 2004 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;" />
