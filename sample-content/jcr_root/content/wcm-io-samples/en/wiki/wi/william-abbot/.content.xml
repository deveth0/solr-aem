&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;William Abbot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (12 June 1790&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Katharine Cockin: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Abbot, William.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; In: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, vol. 1 (2004), p. 36.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;â€“1 June 1843 (age 53)), was an [[England|English]] [[actor]].

He was born in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], [[London]], and made his first appearance on the stage at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 1806, and his first [[London]] appearance in 1808.  At [[Covent Garden]] in 1813, in light [[comedy]] and [[melodrama]], he made his first decided success.  He was Pylades to [[William Charles Macready]]&amp;apos;s Orestes in [[Ambrose Philips]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Distressed Mother&amp;apos;&amp;apos; when Macready made his first appearance at that theatre (1816).  He created the parts of Appius Claudius in [[Sheridan Knowles]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Virginius&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1820) and of Modus in his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hunchback&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1832).

In 1827 he organized the company, including Macready and [[Harriet Smithson]], which acted [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] in [[Paris]].  On his return to [[London]] he played Romeo to [[Fanny Kemble]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Juliet&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1830).  Two of Abbot&amp;apos;s melodramas, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Youthful Days of Frederick the Great&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1817) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Swedish Patriotism&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1819), were produced at [[Covent Garden]].

He died in poverty in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].
