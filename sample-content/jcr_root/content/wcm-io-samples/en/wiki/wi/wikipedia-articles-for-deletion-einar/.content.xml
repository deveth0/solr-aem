*Delete: not an encyclopedic article [[User:Jaredwf|jaredwf]] 06:29, 10 May 2004 (UTC)


Well I&amp;apos;d say names their definition/where they originally come from and what they mean can surely be looked upon as an encyclopedic issue with merit.

Names as you probably well know can be determining factors in peoples lives i.e. a cultural factor for how they fare in certain societies. Knowing about these factors makes it easier to understand why in some countries having a foreign sounding name might make your life more difficult than if you had a native name.

Thus instead of deleting a name it would be more clever to make the name a disambiguation page and allow people to chose what information they were seeking in connection with the name.

Someone seeking information on the archer onboard the Long Worm (Viking vessel) might remember only the archers first name Einar and not the latter Tambarskelvur Einar Tambarskelvur = Einar that makes Tambar shudder (Tambar was the name of Einars Bow) - Einar was one of the characters in the Traditional Norse Kvaed (Song sagas) that actually still are being kept alive in the Faroe Islands.

Someone that would like to know the definition and origin of the name could go to that page

I&amp;apos;m quite certain many interesting people, historical or otherwise who are encyclopedic material could be named Einar something...

Thus deleting the name IMHO would be wrong.

*Keep this page. It is encyclopdic (provided it is correct). Nowhere have I read that says you cant put up name entymologies on Wikipedia. [[User:Burgundavia|Burgundavia]] 20:31, May 13, 2004 (UTC)
**You mean etymologies, which belong in a [[Wiktionary|dictionary]], which [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary|Wikipedia is not]]. If the page is made to be &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;about&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; something (e.g., there was a Norse mythological wombat named Einar), then keep. Short of that, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;delete&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. [[User:Grendelkhan|Grendelkhan]] 20:55, 2004 May 13 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;" />
