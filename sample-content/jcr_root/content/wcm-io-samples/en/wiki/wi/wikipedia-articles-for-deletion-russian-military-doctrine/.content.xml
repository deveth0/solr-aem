POV rant.  [[User:RickK|Rick]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[User talk:RickK|K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] 23:28, 15 May 2004 (UTC)

*Delete. POV essay by anon, which is quite enough in itself IMO, but this one is largely speculation. It contains no useful material and some outright inaccuracies. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 23:59, 15 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete.  No references.  It is not even about military doctrine as the term is used in military articles. [[User:Kd4ttc|Kd4ttc]] 02:57, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
* Delete. Doesn&amp;apos;t correspond to its name. [[User:Mikkalai|Mikkalai]] 03:26, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete, for any one of several different reasons. [[User:MK|MK]] 05:50, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
* Delete this total rant which has nothing to do with military doctrine or history in Russia or China or elsewhere. [[User:AlainV|AlainV]] 21:19, 2004 May 16 (UTC)
* Original research &amp;apos;&amp;apos;at best&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Delete. -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]]|[[User talk:Cyrius|&amp;amp;#9998]] 22:08, May 16, 2004 (UTC)
* Speculation.  Not terribly informed speculation, either. [[User:Isomorphic|Isomorphic]] 02:13, 17 May 2004 (UTC)
