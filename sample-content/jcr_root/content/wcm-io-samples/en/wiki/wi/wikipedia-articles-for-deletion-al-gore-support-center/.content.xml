        text="&lt;p&gt;*&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;Delete&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt;.  Vanity, personal page of [[User:ChrisDJackson]] which is consequently the only other page to link to the article.  Not encyclopedic. --[[User:Starx|Starx]] 01:53, 11 May 2004 (UTC)
*Keep.  Not vanity.  Encyclopedic. [[User:Anthony DiPierro|anthony]] [[User:Anthony_DiPierro/warning|(see warning)]] 02:01, 11 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete, should stay on Chris&amp;apos;s user page, not an article of it&amp;apos;s own. --[[User:Stormie|Stormie]] 04:04, May 11, 2004 (UTC)
* Delete. Vanity. Not encyclopedic. Note that [[User:ChrisDJackson|ChrisDJackson]] blanked this page [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki:VfD-Al_Gore_Support_Center&amp;amp;diff=3531544&amp;amp;oldid=3531532] -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]]|[[User talk:Cyrius|&amp;amp;#9998]] 04:44, May 11, 2004 (UTC)
*It &amp;apos;&amp;apos;seems&amp;apos;&amp;apos; notable to me. Is Chris D. Jackson just exaggerating things here? If he really has 300 people involved in the site and it has achieved the various sorts of recognition claimed in the article and indicated by the picture, I&amp;apos;d say keep. [[User:Everyking|Everyking]] 05:14, 11 May 2004 (UTC)
**Note: The web site contains a bbs with 296 members.  Not exactly what I would consider &amp;quot;involved&amp;quot;. --[[User:Starx|Starx]] 14:26, 11 May 2004 (UTC)
*It&amp;apos;s debatable whether it&amp;apos;s worth keeping, but if kept it &amp;apos;&amp;apos;definitely&amp;apos;&amp;apos; needs some work to make it NPOV.  Currently it reads like self-promotion.  It&amp;apos;s even got a link to Chris&amp;apos;s user page.  Gag.  [[User:Isomorphic|Isomorphic]] 05:38, 11 May 2004 (UTC)
*LOL!  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Badly&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in need of NPOV work if it stays.  My first impulse is to delete and redirect to user page. - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 05:58, 11 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete, almost pure POV, an attempt to use Wikipedia to promote Al Gore, and no evidence that the site is notable. Google search on &amp;quot;links to&amp;quot; http://www.gwu.edu/~action/2004/gore.html gets only four hits, three from within the site itself. &amp;lt;strike&amp;gt;Don&amp;apos;t want to be &amp;apos;&amp;apos;too&amp;apos;&amp;apos; prejudiced here but I&amp;apos;d question the notability of a &amp;quot;personal area&amp;quot; site that doesn&amp;apos;t have its own domain name... with obvious exceptions, say, http://www.princeton.edu/~a_einstein/index.html (note: joke). I&amp;apos;d have to question the seriousness of anyone who couldn&amp;apos;t raise $9.95 or whatever it costs these days to buy a domain name and URL redirect from one of the GoDaddys of the world.&amp;lt;/strike&amp;gt; [[User:Dpbsmith|Dpbsmith]] 12:39, 11 May 2004 (UTC)
**&amp;apos;&amp;apos;I&amp;apos;d question the notability of a &amp;quot;personal area&amp;quot; site that doesn&amp;apos;t have its own domain name&amp;apos;&amp;apos; http://www.algoresupportcenter.com/ [[User:Anthony DiPierro|anthony]] [[User:Anthony_DiPierro/warning|(see warning)]]
***Son-of-a-gun! How come &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;that&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; URL isn&amp;apos;t linked on [[Al Gore Support Center]] or [[User:ChrisDJackson]]? Or is it? I still don&amp;apos;t see it... So, is [http://www.algoresupportcenter.com http://www.algoresupportcenter.com] Chris D. Jackson&amp;apos;s site? Yes, I guess it is: click on &amp;quot;Contact/Info&amp;quot;. OK, that&amp;apos;s actually a pretty impressive-looking site. But... (click click)... Google scores only only 16 web pages that link to it, and only 283 that contain it. OK, I stand corrected... but I&amp;apos;m afraid I still think it&amp;apos;s POV, promotional, and non-notable and should be deleted. [[User:Dpbsmith|Dpbsmith]] 01:15, 13 May 2004 (UTC)
****I don&amp;apos;t know about others, but I tend not to spend too much time improving articles listed on VfD, as it would likely be a waste of my time. [[User:Anthony DiPierro|anthony]] [[User:Anthony_DiPierro/warning|(see warning)]]
*** Hey guys.  I accept your correction Dpbsmith.  If anyone thinks they can re-write a short description of the site that is NPOV, it would be appreciated.  [[User:ChrisDJackson|ChrisDJackson]] 21:34, 13 May 2004 (UTC)
* One of the reasons I left DC... Vanity. Move to userpage. [[User:Alcarillo|Alcarillo]] 14:08, 11 May 2004 (UTC)

* Delete, non-encyclopedic. On a side note, I would wonder if even Al Gore is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;that&amp;apos;&amp;apos; interested in Al Gore.
