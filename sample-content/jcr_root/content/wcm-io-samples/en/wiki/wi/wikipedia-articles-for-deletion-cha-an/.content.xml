&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is an archive of the discussion surrounding the proposed deletion of the page entitled [[Cha&amp;apos;an]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is kept as an historic record.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The result of the debate was to keep the article.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

----

Authors were clearly thinking of [[Chan]] (Chinese Zen), which is sometimes spelled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ch&amp;apos;an&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and which already has a much more complete entry.  Article has multiple factual errors and hasn&amp;apos;t been edited in more than a year.  &amp;quot;Cha&amp;apos;an&amp;quot; is not a legitimate alternative spelling.

* Keep and redirect.  If it&amp;apos;s a mis-spelling it&amp;apos;s a common one - for instance [http://dir.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/Religion_and_Spirituality/Faiths_and_Practices/Buddhism/Schools__Lineages__and_Sects/Zen/Schools/Cha_an/] - [[User:Topbanana|TB]] 14:28, 12 May 2004 (UTC)
* Redirect to [[Chan]]. Agree with TB. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 00:23, 13 May 2004 (UTC)
* Agree with above [[User:Burgundavia|Burgundavia]] 06:30, May 13, 2004 (UTC)
