&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wikipedia:Barnstars|Barnstars]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are used on [[Wikipedia]] to reward users who make &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;outstanding contributions&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in a particular area. To give someone an award, all you have to do, is copy the code from the table onto the talk page of the person you want to give the award to, and tell them why you have given it to them. There are many types of barnstar to choose from; if you are sure your choice is appropriate — &amp;apos;&amp;apos;don&amp;apos;t be shy!&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
