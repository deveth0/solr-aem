&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is an archive of the discussion surrounding the proposed deletion of the pages entitled [[Pontdolgoch]] and [[Caersws]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is kept as an historic record.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The result of the debate was to keep the article.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Two sub-stubs that only say that each are small villages in Wales.  Went for speedy delete, but the author removed the notice.  I certainly would support a motion to see them expanded since they&amp;apos;re real places, but these are just unencyclopedic as is.  Anyone feeling up to the task? - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 19:06, 15 May 2004 (UTC)
* Keep.  Legitimate stub. [[User:ElBenevolente|ElBenevolente]] 19:53, 15 May 2004 (UTC)
*Keep all articles about real places, no matter how stubby, so long as they&amp;apos;re true.  [[User:RickK|Rick]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[User talk:RickK|K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] 20:33, 15 May 2004 (UTC)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;keep&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; I realise they are fairly bare now, but i am and will add to them (and they definately are real places... i promise!) [[User:Ahadley|ahadley]] 18:38, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
* Keep - appear to be real, and there&amp;apos;s a consensus on keeping real places. -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]]|[[User talk:Cyrius|&amp;amp;#9998]] 22:20, May 16, 2004 (UTC)
* Keep - real places. In the case of the Caersws article I see the VfD notice was slapped on 8 minutes after the stub was created: this is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;far&amp;apos;&amp;apos; too soon anyway -- contributors &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;must&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; be given a chance to flesh out articles. -- [[User:Arwel Parry|Arwel]] 23:01, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
*Hmm...I should have looked at the time stamp.  Sorry &amp;apos;bout dat.  I drop my delete vote, but I&amp;apos;d still like to see more than just &amp;quot;a very small village in Wales.&amp;quot;  Keep as stub. - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 16:15, 17 May 2004 (UTC)
