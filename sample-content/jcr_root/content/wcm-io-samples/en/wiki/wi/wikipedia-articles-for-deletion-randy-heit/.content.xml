        text="&lt;p&gt;Article [[Randy Heit]] listed on [[WP:VFD]] Apr 24 to Apr 30 2004.  Only vote to keep was mine so I changed my mind and deleted per consensus.  Discussion:

Insignificant, although I happen to like ZDoom. [[User:Fredrik|Fredrik]] 22:00, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Marginal keep.  Google gives 337 hits for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Randy Heit zdoom&amp;apos;&amp;apos; though in the first list of ten there&amp;apos;s already a copy of the wiki article.  Unfortunately I don&amp;apos;t know enough about the subject to say any more than that. -- [[User:Francs2000|Graham  :)]] | [[User talk:Francs2000|Talk]] 21:47, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)
**Should Wikipedia have an article on every person developing a piece of software who is mentioned more than 300 times on the Internet? Well, perhaps... [[User:Fredrik|Fredrik]] 18:27, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)
***I did say &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;marginal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; keep.  As I say I don&amp;apos;t know the subject.  If I&amp;apos;m wrong then vote to delete as is your right. -- [[User:Francs2000|Graham  :)]] | [[User talk:Francs2000|Talk]] 21:27, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)
