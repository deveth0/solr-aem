* Original research. [[User:Raul654|&amp;amp;rarr;Raul654]] 04:06, Mar 26, 2004 (UTC)
* Delete. --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 04:09, Mar 26, 2004 (UTC)
* This should be speedy-delete material.  Some happy wiseacre simply clicked on the requested article link. - [[User:Hephaestos|Hephaestos]]|[[User talk:Hephaestos|&amp;amp;#167;]] 04:13, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*&amp;lt;s&amp;gt; That this article is &amp;quot;original research&amp;quot; is the least of its problems.  It&amp;apos;s a high school essay about video games, mentioning the name of its author in its first line, that never once mentions the name &amp;quot;Iain Sinclair.&amp;quot;  I&amp;apos;m in fact trying to delete it now (it&amp;apos;s a speedy deletion if there ever was one), but haven&amp;apos;t been able to do so.  Could another admin please try to delete this one?  The process isn&amp;apos;t working for me.  [[User:Moncrief|Moncrief]] 04:15, Mar 26, 2004 (UTC)&amp;lt;/s&amp;gt;
* I tried too, didn&amp;apos;t work for me either. - [[User:Hephaestos|Hephaestos]]|[[User talk:Hephaestos|&amp;amp;#167;]] 04:18, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)
* Delete. Reasons above... but IMO is not even passable for a highschool essay. Stream-of-consciousness &amp;quot;research&amp;quot; into laziness. [[User:Abscissa|Abscissa]] 04:42, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*OK, I replaced the initial bilge with a (hopefully) acceptable stub, so Keep. [[User:67.124.48.102|67.124.48.102]] 05:48, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*Keep stub.  Nice work. [[User:Meelar|Meelar]] 05:53, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)
**Thanks. From some of the comments I read, he seems to be the [[Michael Moore]] of London (instead of corporate America--either love him or hate him. Made me interested in his writing. [[User:Niteowlneils|Niteowlneils]] 05:29, 27 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*Keep, now that it&amp;apos;s been entirely rewritten and is actually about Iain Sinclair. [[User:Moncrief|Moncrief]] 06:18, Mar 26, 2004 (UTC)
*Keep new version. [[User:Fennec|Fennec]] 06:50, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*I&amp;apos;d like to have it deleted to get rid of the history with the obnoxious essay in it. Then a genuine page can be started with the stub that&amp;apos;s there now. -- [[User:Friedo|Friedo]] 07:02, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)
**Comment: That&amp;apos;s a sensible suggestion, but it&amp;apos;s not a reason to delete under current policy, nor technically easy AFAIK now that a genuine article has been written sharing the same history (which is the reason for the policy I guess). Food for thought. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 03:05, 27 Mar 2004 (UTC)
* I have added more detail to the stub so keep - [[User:seaeagle04|seaeagle04]]
* Keep, yes.  It looks fine now. - [[User:Hephaestos|Hephaestos]]|[[User talk:Hephaestos|&amp;amp;#167;]] 07:20, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*Keep now. [[User:DJ Clayworth|DJ Clayworth]] 15:36, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*Keep -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]] | [[User talk:Cyrius|Talk]] 20:01, Mar 26, 2004 (UTC)
*Keep, very good article now. [[User:Premeditated Chaos|PMC]] 04:22, 27 Mar 2004 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;" />
