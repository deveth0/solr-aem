*Delete. [[User:JeffyJeffyMan2004|JeffyJeffyMan2004]] 11:19, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC), I&amp;apos;m friends with this guy but still sometimes he takes it just a little bit too far, this is sane compared with some of the stuff he comes up with at school, But still it&amp;apos;s just a load of Bilge so delete it.Put it on [[bad jokes and other deleted nonsense]] afterwards though.
**Delete. Unfunny prank and possibly also harrassment of a real person. BTW, nominating your own jokes for BJAODN isn&amp;apos;t very cool either IMO. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 15:03, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)

*Delete. I&amp;apos;m surprised this doesn&amp;apos;t qualify as a speedy deletion, actually. [[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]] 07:21, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*Delete - don&amp;apos;t put on bad jokes and other deleted nonsense as no else is ever likely to &amp;quot;get it&amp;quot;. [[User:Theresa knott|theresa knott]] 13:34, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)
**Comment - There&amp;apos;s lots of stuff on bad jokes and other deleted stuff that isn&amp;apos;t funny, It is not my own joke - this page was made by Tim Smith, Plus Banno doesn&amp;apos;t mind anymore about the dancing.
***Comment: Who knows, who cares? Comments on [[User talk:JeffyJeffyMan2004|your user page]]. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 20:00, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;" />
