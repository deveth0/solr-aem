        text="&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;WinNuke&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refers to a remote [[denial-of-service attack]] (DoS) that affected the [[Microsoft]] [[Windows 95]], [[Microsoft]] [[Windows NT]] and [[Microsoft]] [[Windows 3.1x]] [[computer]] [[operating system]]s. The [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] sent a string of [[Out-of-band|OOB]] (out of band) data to the target computer on [[TCP/IP|TCP]] port 139 ([[NetBIOS]]),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-1999-0153 |title=National Vulnerability Database (NVD) National Vulnerability Database (CVE-1999-0153) |publisher=Web.nvd.nist.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; causing it to lock up and display a [[Blue Screen of Death]]. This did not damage or change the data on the computer&amp;apos;s hard disk, but any unsaved data would be lost.

The so-called OOB simply means that the malicious TCP packet contained an [[TCP header|Urgent Pointer]] (URG). The Urgent Pointer is a rarely used field in the TCP header, used to indicate that some of the data in the TCP stream should be processed quickly by the recipient. Affected operating systems didn&amp;apos;t handle the Urgent Pointer field correctly.

A person under the screen-name &amp;quot;_eci&amp;quot; published his [[C (programming language)|C]] [[source code]] for the exploit on June 7, 1997.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://insecure.org/sploits/windows.OOB.DOS.html |title=Windows NT/95/3.11 Out Of Band (OOB) data barf |publisher=Insecure.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; With the source code being widely used and distributed, [[Microsoft]] was forced to create security patches, which were released a few weeks later.  For a time, numerous flavors of this exploit appeared going by such names as fedup, gimp, killme, killwin, knewkem, liquidnuke, mnuke, netnuke, muerte, nuke, nukeattack, nuker102, pnewq, project1, pstlince, simportnuke, sprite, sprite32, [[VConnect|vconnect]], vzmnuker, wingenocide, winnukeit, winnuker02, winnukev95, wnuke3269, wnuke4, and wnuke95.

A company called SemiSoft Solutions from New Zealand created a small program, called AntiNuke, that blocks WinNuke without having to install the official patch.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://robert.grefstad.com/win/error_winnuke.html Windows OOB Bug, also known as WinNuke]. Grefstad.com.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Years later, a second incarnation of WinNuke that uses another, similar exploit was found.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|last=Michael |first=James |url=http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-1054537.html |title=WinNuke lives on, and it&amp;apos;s coming to a system near you |publisher=Articles.techrepublic.com.com |date=2002-10-02 |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
