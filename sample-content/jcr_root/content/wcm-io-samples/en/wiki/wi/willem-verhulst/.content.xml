&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Willem Verhulst&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the second director of the [[Dutch West India Company]]. In 1625, Verhulst oversaw the decision to locate the company&amp;apos;s main fortress and town on the tip of [[Manhattan]] Island in the colony of [[New Netherland]]. The settlement, which was given the name [[New Amsterdam]], was the first permanent European settlement in what was to later [[New York City]].  Verhulst was not popular with the Dutch colonists and was quickly replaced by Peter Minuit
