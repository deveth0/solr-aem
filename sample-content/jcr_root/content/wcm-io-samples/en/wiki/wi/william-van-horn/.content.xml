&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;William Van Horn&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born February 15, 1939) has been a [[Disney comics]] artist and writer since 1988. He draws mostly [[Donald Duck]], [[Uncle Scrooge]], and he has also written and/or illustrated stories based on the [[animated series]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[DuckTales]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Some of these stories featured [[Launchpad McQuack]] as the main character.

Prior to his association with Disney, Van Horn drew and wrote a black and white comic book called &amp;quot;Nervous Rex&amp;quot; for [[Blackthorne Publishing]].  Focusing on the misadventures of a small, non-violent tyrannosaurus, the series ran for ten issues, from 1985 to 1987.  Afterwards, also for Blackthorne, he drew and wrote a short-lived superhero parody comic called &amp;quot;Possibleman,&amp;quot; which ran for two issues.

In the first years of his career as a Disney Comics artist William often worked with [[John Lustig]] on the stories. In 1994 he did the art for [[Carl Barks]]&amp;apos; final script, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Horsing around with History]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which was released in [[Uncle Scrooge Adventures]] #33.

William&amp;apos;s son [[Noel Van Horn]] is also a Disney comics artist, focusing on [[Mickey Mouse]]-stories.

Here is a list of characters William Van Horn created for the Duck universe:
* Baron Itzy Bitzy - a whistling flea that Scrooge has.
* [[Rumpus McFowl]] - Scrooge&amp;apos;s half brother who at first was believed to be Scrooge&amp;apos;s cousin.
* Woimly Filcher - an enemy of Donald Duck and his nephews.
