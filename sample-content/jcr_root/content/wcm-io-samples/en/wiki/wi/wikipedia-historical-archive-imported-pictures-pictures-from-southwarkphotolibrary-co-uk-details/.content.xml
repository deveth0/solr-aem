I don&amp;apos;t know if you can help me, or know who I should contact, but I&amp;apos;ve
been asked if an on-line local history site can use small images from the
photo library. They would be a maximum of 300 pixels wide and used to
illustrate articles about the borough.

It isn&amp;apos;t obvious from the photo library the license that the photos have
been released under. The projects runs under a &amp;quot;copyleft&amp;quot; license (the
GFDL) and ideally would need images in the public domain, or specific
permission to use them.

Thanks for your help

Hi XXXX,

They can download general images of the borough from our website. It&amp;apos;s
only pics of Councillors and residents that are password protected.

If they log onto the website, they need to click on the &amp;apos;News&amp;apos; icon, then
&amp;apos;Photolibrary&amp;apos;. Photos of the borough are under &amp;apos;Places&amp;apos;.

Hope this helps. Any questions, do come back to me - or you can give them
my number and I&amp;apos;ll talk to them direct if that helps.

Nancy.
(Press office, x XXXX)
