*Comment. Two books currently available from Walmart/Amazon/B&amp;amp;N, from publishers that seem to be non-vanity and scholarly. I&amp;apos;m too new here (about 5 weeks, only 12-1400 edits)--do we have a standard threshold for authors? [[User:Niteowlneils|Niteowlneils]] 06:01, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)
::OK, I&amp;apos;ve formatted the article and expanded it to include his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;offline&amp;apos;&amp;apos; accomplishments to give people a better view to vote on. [[User:Niteowlneils|Niteowlneils]] 06:01, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Delete: personal promotion. [[User:66.108.138.83]] has littered other articles ([[art]], [[Ayn Rand]], [[definition of art]]) with promotional stuff, and also created the promotional article [[Michelle Marder Kamhi]]. Away with this garbage; let him/her pay for advertising. [[User:Wile E. Heresiarch|Wile E. Heresiarch]] 14:11, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Delete.  There is no meaningful content in the article, just the two-book bibliography.  Bear in mind that the large booksellers (Amazon etc) now have micropublisher programs in place to sell books that only sell a handful of copies, so presence on Amazon no longer connotes mainstream sales.

*This did not have the VfD note on it. I&amp;apos;ve put it on now. I think it should be kept for at least another five days before a decision is made. The article seems factual and correct, so I see no reason to delete it. [[User:Camembert|Camembert]] 14:50, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Keep. [[User:BL|BL]] 07:41, Apr 19, 2004 (UTC)
*Keep. [[User:Anthony DiPierro|anthony]] [[User:Anthony_DiPierro/warning|(see warning)]]&lt;/p&gt;" />
