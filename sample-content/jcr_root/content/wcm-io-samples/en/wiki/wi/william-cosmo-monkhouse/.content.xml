&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;William Cosmo Monkhouse&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (18 March 1840 &amp;amp;ndash; 20 July 1901), [[England|English]] [[poet]] and [[critic]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{1911}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Biography==
Monkhouse was born in London. His father, Cyril John Monkhouse, was a [[solicitor]]; his mother&amp;apos;s maiden name was Delafosse. He was educated at [[St Paul&amp;apos;s School (London)|St Paul&amp;apos;s School]], quitting it at seventeen to enter the [[Board of Trade|board of trade]] as a junior supplementary clerk, from which grade he rose eventually to be the assistant-secretary to the finance department of the office. In 1870–71 he visited [[South America]] in connection with the hospital accommodation for seamen at [[Valparaíso]], [[Chile]], and other ports; and he served on different departmental committees, notably that of 1894–96 on the Mercantile Marine Fund. He was twice married: first, to Laura, daughter of James Keymer of [[Dartford]]; and, secondly, to Leonora Eliza, daughter of Commander Blount, R.N.

Cosmo Monkhouse was one of those who have not only a vocation, but an [[avocation]]. His first bias was to poetry, and in 1865 he issued &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Dream of Idleness and Other Poems&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a collection strongly coloured by his admiration for [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]. It was marked by exceptional maturity, and scarcely received the recognition it deserved. Owing perhaps to this circumstance, it was not till 1890 that he put forth &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Corn and Poppies&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a collection which contains at least one memorable effort in the well-known &amp;quot;Dead March.&amp;quot; Five years later appeared a limited edition of the striking ballad of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Christ upon the Hill&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, illustrated with etchings by [[William Strang]]. After his death his poetical output was completed by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pasiteles the Elder and other Poems&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Christ upon the Hill&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

In 1868 Monkhouse wrote a novel, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Question of Honour&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Then, after preluding with a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Life of [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the &amp;quot;Great Artists Series&amp;quot; (1879), he devoted himself almost exclusively to art criticism. Besides many contributions to the [[The Academy (periodical)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Academy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], the [[Saturday Review (London)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Saturday Review&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]], the [[The Magazine of Art|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Magazine of Art&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] and other periodicals, he published volumes on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Italian Pre-Raphaelites&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1887), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Earlier English Water-Colour Painters&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1890 and 1897), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;In the National Gallery&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1895) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;British Contemporary Artists&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1899).  He wrote a monograph on the illustrator of [[Alice&amp;apos;s Adventures in Wonderland]] entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Life and Work of Sir John Tenniel, R. I. (London: 1901)]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He was a contributor to the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dictionary of National Biography]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from the beginning. Monkhouse also wrote an excellent Memoir of [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] in the &amp;quot;Great Writers Series&amp;quot; (1887).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citation | last = Monkhouse | first =William Cosmo | coauthors =Anderson, John Parker | title =&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Life of Leigh Hunt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|year = 1893 | place= London| publisher=Walter Scott Ltd. | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=PztIAAAAIAAJ}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

As an art critic Monkhouse&amp;apos;s judgments were highly valued; and he had the rare gift of differing without offending, while he invariably secured respect for his honesty and ability. As a poet, his ambition was wide and his devotion to the art thorough.
