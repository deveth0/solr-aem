        text="&lt;p&gt;Articles [[Internet democracy]] and [[Open-Source Government]] listed on [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion]] Apr 29 to May 6 2004, consensus was to keep [[Internet democracy]] but delete [[Open-Source Government]].  Discussion:

Both articles listed as requiring deletion in the [[MediaWiki:VfD-Open_source_concept|deletion debate]] for the (now deleted) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Open source concept&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; article. -- [[User:Francs2000|Graham  :)]] | [[User talk:Francs2000|Talk]] 00:03, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC)

*Comment: See [[talk:Internet democracy]]. [[User:Tillwe|till we *)]] 13:56, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Comment: The essence of the problem with &amp;quot;Internet democracy&amp;quot; is that the original author created a rubbish entry containing a newly coined concept and pointing only to his site.  A subsequent author came along and replaced it with appropriate accurate text that fits the term.  Now, the original author is being stubborn and continually attempting to restore his rubbish text.  If the accurate text can be solidified, there would be no point in deleting this term; however, if the original author cannot be stopped from his foolish behavior, then either that author should be banned or this term be deleted.

**Comment: was the new text based around an actual term because my interpretation of your comment is that a concept was made to fit &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;internet democracy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. -- [[User:Francs2000|Graham  :)]] | [[User talk:Francs2000|Talk]] 02:50, 3 May 2004 (UTC)
***Comment: The new text is what I think is an accurate generic description of the term &amp;quot;Internet democracy&amp;quot;, whereas the original &amp;quot;political system&amp;quot; version (now in the bottom of the article) is a specific term that was recently invented so as to point to a single external site by its author. -- [[User:Stevietheman|Stevietheman]] 05:32, 3 May 2004 (UTC)
*Wikisource and delete? [[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]]
*Keep [[Internet democracy]], continue fighting off reversions. -- Delete [[Open-Source Government]]: an original essay by [http://www.deanofcincinnati.com a nobody with a weblog], quoted &amp;apos;&amp;apos;in extenso&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Not suitable for Wikisource. [[User:Wile E. Heresiarch|Wile E. Heresiarch]] 08:03, 2 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete/wikisource [[Open-Source Government]] - [[User:Texture|T&amp;amp;#949;x]][[User Talk:Texture|&amp;lt;font color=red&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#964;&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;]][[User:Texture|ur&amp;amp;#949;]] 16:41, 3 May 2004 (UTC)
*Keep [[Internet democracy]] - if it were deleted to avoid reverts the author would just recreate it.  If there is a legitimate article to be kept then fight for it. - [[User:Texture|T&amp;amp;#949;x]][[User Talk:Texture|&amp;lt;font color=red&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#964;&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;]][[User:Texture|ur&amp;amp;#949;]] 16:41, 3 May 2004 (UTC)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;D&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;elete [[Open-Source Government]] - a quasi-journalistic collection of POV ideas generalising open source, &amp;lt;strike&amp;gt;worms&amp;lt;/strike&amp;gt; viruses and crop farming, culminating in the assertion that government should therefore be open. I hope there are better reasons. I hope there are better deans. I know there are better metaphors. --[[User:Zigger|Zigger]] 20:29, 2004 May 3 (UTC)
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;eep [[Internet democracy]], but I also support removing the &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; section after voting &amp;quot;closes&amp;quot;. (Perhaps the original contributor could merge some of the concepts into [[Radical transparency]].) --[[User:Zigger|Zigger]] 20:29, 2004 May 3 (UTC)
