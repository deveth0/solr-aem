* delete. [[User:Exploding Boy|Exploding Boy]] 08:49, Apr 8, 2004 (UTC)
* Delete.  Totally an advert...googling just brings up a few links to the kid&amp;apos;s promotional site--nothing independent.  Note also the first person writing on the page.  [[User:Postdlf|Postdlf]] 14:00 Apr 8 2004 (UTC)
* Keep. Well, it is a cultural thing.. especially if you live in a place where it doesn&amp;apos;t normally snow. [[User: Rhymeless|Rhymeless]] 16:24 Apr 8 2004 (UTC)
**It&amp;apos;s a &amp;quot;cultural thing&amp;quot; only according to slickyboarding.com.  If it can be proven that there are independent references aside from just one promotional site (that has managed to get itself listed in a few web directories), then maybe it can be kept.  [[User:Postdlf|Postdlf]] 8:05 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)
***I suppose you have a point there. It stands to reason that anyone who wants to sled, but doesn&amp;apos;t have one, will use whatever alternative they have, and the same would suffice whether they had snow or not. So maybe it&amp;apos;s not especially cultural. I&amp;apos;ve seen this done numerous times...but never heard it called &amp;quot;slickyboarding&amp;quot;. Could the entry be salvaged by the removal of the advert? [[User:Rhymeless|Rhymeless]] 09:33, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Delete. Blatant ad. [[User:Cribcage|Cribcage]] 22:45, 10 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Delete.  I live in one of those areas without snow.  While I&amp;apos;ve heard of this being done, never heard any name for it. --[[User:Ssd|ssd]] 03:11, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)
