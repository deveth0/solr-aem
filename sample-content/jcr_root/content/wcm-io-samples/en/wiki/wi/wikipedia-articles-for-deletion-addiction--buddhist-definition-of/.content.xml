        text="&lt;p&gt;This article reads like a personal essay that attempts to support an undergrad&amp;apos;s original research by referring to Buddhist philosophy. The essence of this page is a table of concepts apparently original to ScottPerry that claims to be &amp;quot;An overlay of the Buddhist model of addiction onto the most commonly accepted Western world-view&amp;quot;. The overlay incorrectly represents &amp;quot;the most commonly accepted Western world-view&amp;quot;, especially in the context of addiction medicine, and misrepresents by omission how Buddhist philosophy has significantly influenced western behavioral medicine. The article does not support claims that anything is &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; Bhuddist definition. If the article cited some &amp;apos;&amp;apos;published&amp;apos;&amp;apos; sources that are used in actual Buddhist schools of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;teaching&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (not Buddhists schools of &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;thought&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;), it would begin to be an accurate assessment. Otherwise, it is one person&amp;apos;s point of view about how their individual understanding of Buddhism offers what they see as a better approach to the idea of addiction than does their perception of &amp;quot;western&amp;quot; approaches. The sole source cited to support this essay is another on-line personal essay, the author of which admits was written &amp;quot;partly for my own pleasure&amp;quot;. In as much as the article accurately summarizes Buddhist approaches, it could stand as a subsection of the [[addiction]] article. Whatever is not rooted in other Buddhist sources can be published in a forum more suited for personal essays. [[User:Torrid|Torrid]] 17:56, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)

*Merge with addiction and/or Buddhism and delete.  [[User:Postdlf|Postdlf]]  22:23 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Delete: original research, so don&amp;apos;t merge w/ Buddhism or addiction. BTW the &amp;quot;add to this debate&amp;quot; link above is broken. [[User:Wile E. Heresiarch|Wile E. Heresiarch]] 21:06, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;" />
