&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;William Moon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Hon. LLD, FRSA, FRGS (December 18, 1818 &amp;amp;ndash; October 9, 1894) was an [[England|Englishman]] who created [[Moon type]], the first widely-used practical reading alphabet for the blind.

== Life and career ==
Moon was born in [[Horsmonden]], [[Kent]]. As a small child, he lost sight in one [[eye]] from scarlet fever, and by the age of twenty-one he had become totally [[blindness|blind]].&amp;lt;ref name=Farrell102&amp;gt;Farrell, p. 102.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He moved in with his widowed mother and sister in [[Brighton]], [[East Sussex]]. He became a teacher, and taught boys how to read using the existing [[Paper embossing|embossed]] reading codes.

Moon realised that the boys found these reading codes difficult to learn. He devised a new system, Moon type, based on a simplified [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]], which he designed to be easier to learn.&amp;lt;ref name=Farrell102/&amp;gt; He first formulated his ideas in 1843 and they were published in 1845. Moon type was subsequently replaced in popularity by [[Braille]] but it is still important for people who have difficulty reading Braille.

Moon achieved several distinctions during his lifetime: he was elected to fellowships of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 1852 and 1857 respectively; he was also awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary LLD degree]] by the [[University of Philadelphia]] in 1871.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Day &amp;amp;amp; McNeil 1995, p.499.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
