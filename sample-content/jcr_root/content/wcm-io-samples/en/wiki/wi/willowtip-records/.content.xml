&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Willowtip Records&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an independently owned and distributed [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[record label]] headquartered in [[Zelienople]], [[Pennsylvania]].

==Background==
Willowtip Records was founded in 2000 by Jason Tipton with a partner named Willosin, who is no longer involved with the label. The combination of the two names is the source of the label&amp;apos;s name. They specialize in [[death metal]] and [[grindcore]] music, mostly from highly technical bands. The first release was a split EP between [[Fate of Icarus]] and [[Creation Is Crucifixion]]. Tipton has stated that his proudest moment with the label was re-releasing &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Onset of Putrefaction]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  by the band [[Necrophagist]]. It had not been available in the U.S. or elsewhere until Willowtip started redistributing it.

Willowtip have also collaborated with [[Colorado]] &amp;quot;hydrogrind&amp;quot; band [[Cephalic Carnage]] to release an exclusive one song EP entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Halls of Amenti&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Some of the label&amp;apos;s more popular former acts include [[Arsis]], [[Ion Dissonance]], [[Misery Index (band)|Misery Index]] and [[Neuraxis (band)|Neuraxis]]. The roster features bands from several different countries, including [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Finland]], [[Italy]], [[Sweden]] and [[Australia]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.lambgoat.com/features/interviews/willowtip.aspx Willowtip Records interview // Interviews // Features // Lambgoat&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.willowtip.com/bands/ Willowtip | Bands&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In mid-2007, Willowtip entered into a partnership with Dutch death metal record label [[Neurotic Records]] to distribute their previously unavailable releases in North America.
Willowtip has also entered into a licensing agreement with [[Candlelight Records]] who will issue Willowtip releases for the European (and &amp;apos;rest of world&amp;apos;) market.
