        text="&lt;p&gt;[[Wikipedia]] appears to be a valuable reference tool for [[usenet]] discussions. The importance of a neutral reference tool with (always improving) factual accuracy, especially when dealing with controversial subjects that are frequently discussed at usenet, is extremely high (Some of these discussions are denounced as &amp;quot;partisan wrangling&amp;quot; by some [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|wikipedian]]s, but are nonetheless significant for their participants).

Some usenet posters are extremely knowledgeable about certain fields and could have a lot of value for Wikipedia, for example, in a long &amp;apos;&amp;apos;sci.environment&amp;apos;&amp;apos; discussion about [[global warming]], A debate related to [[climate change]] has been taking place that had significance for its corresponding Wikipedia article. The main points of the debate have been edited into Wikipedia by a conscientious poster. This is an example of how Wikipedia can serve as a reference tool to summarize discussions of controversial topics that are frequently debated at usenet (And also serve as an excellent starting point for them, or even replace them altogether!)

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;alt.food.vegan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; seems to have adopted the [[wikibooks:Cookbook:Vegan cuisine|vegan recipes]] articles to document and exchange vegetarian recipes, this is also an example of how Wikipedia can be harnessed by usenet while expanding the written human knowledge.
