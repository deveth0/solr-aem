The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;William Jolly Bridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a vehicular and pedestrian bridge over the [[Brisbane River]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. It is a steel frame [[arch bridge]] with an unusual concrete veneer and was opened to traffic on 30 March 1932 by Sir [[John Goodwin (governor)|John Goodwin]], the [[Governor of Queensland]].

When opened, during the worst year of the [[Great Depression]], the bridge was known simply as the Grey Street Bridge.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;look&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=Looking up looking back at old Brisbane |last=Readshaw |first=Grahame |coauthors=Ronald Wood |year=1987 |publisher=Boolarong Publications |location=[[Bowen Hills, Queensland]] |isbn=0-86439-032-7 |page=52 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was renamed to the William Jolly Bridge on 5 July 1955 in memory of [[William Jolly]], the first [[Lord Mayor]] of Greater Brisbane.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;look&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Design==
The aim of the bridge was to reduce traffic congestion on [[Victoria Bridge, Brisbane|Victoria Bridge]] during peak periods.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;lhbris&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; It was designed by [[Harding Frew]], a local but prominent [[civil engineer]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=The Brisbane River: A pictorial history |last=Longhurst |first=Robert |coauthors=William Douglas |publisher=W.D. Incorporated Pty Ltd |location=Brisbane |isbn=0-646-34472-2 |page=26}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
The style of the bridge&amp;apos;s design is [[art deco]], which was popular at the time. Manuel R. Hornibrook&amp;apos;s company built the bridge that consists of two piers that were built in the river and two pylons on the river banks, which support three graceful arches.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;look&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; The rainbow arch type, as it was described, was claimed to be the first of its type in Australia.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;lhbris&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; The concrete surface was treated to make it appear like &amp;quot;light-coloured [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]]&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;lhbris&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=Living History of Brisbane |last=Hogan |first=Janet |year=1982 |publisher=Boolarong Publications |location=Spring Hill, Queensland |isbn=0-908175-41-8 |page=108 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Traffic use==
The William Jolly Bridge is shared by vehicular traffic, pedestrians and cyclists. It connects Grey Street in [[South Brisbane, Queensland|South Brisbane]] to Roma Street on the western edge of the [[Brisbane central business district]]. The bridge was conceived as a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of Brisbane to avoid increasing [[traffic congestion]] on the [[Victoria Bridge, Brisbane|Victoria Bridge]] and on downtown streets such as George Street. It was constructed with the intention of building [[tram]] lines over it and although the tracks were never installed, anchor points for tramway overhead were installed at the top of each arch.  These overhead anchor points remain in situ.

===Congestion===
The bridge has two lanes for motor traffic in each direction, and a [[Sidewalk|footpath]] on each side of the bridge.  By 2006, the [[Brisbane City Council]] reported that on a typical weekday, 42000 vehicles crossed the bridge and at peak times both ends of the bridge suffered from congestion. The [[Go Between Bridge]] is expected to relieve congestion on the William Jolly Bridge now that it has opened.

==Cultural references==
The bridge was a location for the filming of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Inspector Gadget 2]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,22929522-5012980,00.html |title=Casting director faces the camera |accessdate=2008-01-11 |work=[[The Courier Mail]] | first=Kellie | last=Alderman | date=15 December 2007}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
