*Move to meta.  [[User:RickK|Rick]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[User talk:RickK|K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] 06:24, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Ditto. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 06:35, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Good call. Quite nice though. [[User:Pteron|Pteron]] 06:51, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Certainly move somewhere. Just [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wiki_personality_type&amp;amp;dummy=1&amp;amp;diff=0&amp;amp;oldid=3223305 look at how brilliant] it is (no offence meant, [[user:Wik|Wik]], but you missed another one). But it can&amp;apos;t stay in the article namespace. Meta or [[Wikipedia:Project namespace|project]]? [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 07:10, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Meta, see [[:m:Wikipedia sociology]] -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]]|[[User talk:Cyrius|&amp;amp;#9998]] 07:50, Apr 17, 2004 (UTC)
* Agreed: Meta. [[User:Cribcage|Cribcage]] 14:02, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Meta. [[User:Exploding Boy|Exploding Boy]] 01:46, Apr 18, 2004 (UTC)
* Intresting topic, but at the very least it should be under [[Wikipedia:Wiki personality type]] instead of [[Wiki personality type]], even if we don&amp;apos;t delete it outright (which I hope we don&amp;apos;t). Unless Wikipedia poster behavior has become as independently famous as, well, [[Slashdot trolling phenomena]] have. [[User:Wiwaxia|Wiwaxia]] 22:44, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Move. Neat article. I&amp;apos;d say that although the archetypes are sound, each of us has parts of more than one archetype. Someone ought to compare against other personality typers like [[MBTI]]. - [[User:UtherSRG|UtherSRG]] 00:34, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Moved to [[m:Wiki personality type]]. [[User:Angela|Angela]][[user talk:Angela|.]] 10:58, Apr 22, 2004 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;" />
