The Reverend Fr. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;William J. Fulco, [[Jesuit|S.J.]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born February 24, 1936) is a [[Jesuit]] [[priest]] and [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] [[Professor]] of Ancient [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] Studies at [[Loyola Marymount University]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] in the [[United States]].

Fulco was born in [[Los Angeles]]. He entered the [[Society of Jesus]] in August 1954 and was ordained a [[Catholic priest|priest]] in June 1966. He has spent most of his career in education.

He was hired to translate the dialogs for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Passion of the Christ]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; into a hypothetical reconstructed form of Aramaic, the Aramaic that Jesus spoke, making him one of the few professional historical linguists specializing in the production (or more precisely translation) of texts in unattested or poorly attested languages known to have existed, with a focus on the needs of the movie industry. Fulco does not reconstruct grammars (open generative structures) of poorly attested or unattested language forms known to have existed, he reconstructs &amp;apos;&amp;apos;finite texts&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in such language forms and the reconstruction is limited to the necessities of the production of such texts. &amp;lt;!-- making him one of the few professional [[conlanger]]s. --&amp;gt; His reconstructed Aramaic used in the film incorporated elements of the [[language]] of the [[Book of Daniel]], fourth-century [[Syriac]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].  Fulco has also worked on such films as &amp;quot;[[The Nativity Story]]&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]].&amp;quot;
