The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Flakpanzer IV &amp;quot;Wirbelwind&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Whirlwind&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[English language|English]]) was a [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|self-propelled anti-aircraft gun]] based on the [[Panzer IV]] tank. It was developed in 1944 as a successor to the earlier self-propelled anti-aircraft gun &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Möbelwagen]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In the first years of the war, the [[Wehrmacht]] had less interest in developing self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, but as the Allies began to gain air superiority, the need for more mobile and better-armed self-propelled anti-aircraft guns increased. During the early summer of 1944, SS-&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Hauptsturmführer]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Karl Wilhelm Krause]] with the [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend|12th SS Panzer Division &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hitlerjugend&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] came up with the concept of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Flakpanzer IV Wirbelwind&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.achtungpanzer.com/flak4.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He presented the concept to SS-&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Obersturmbannführer&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Max Wünsche]], commanding officer of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment and it was approved by Hitler.

The Panzer IV&amp;apos;s turret was removed and replaced with an open-top, nine-sided turret which housed a quadruple [[2 cm FlaK 30#2 cm Flakvierling 38|2 cm &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Flakvierling&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 38 L/112.5]]. A closed-top design would have been preferable, but this was not possible due to the heavy smoke generated by the four anti-aircraft guns. Production of the tank was carried out by &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ostbau Werke]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Żagań|Sagan]], [[Silesia]]. Thereafter, the 2 cm shells proved less effective against aircraft so a more powerful successor was produced which eventually replaced it. Known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Flakpanzer IV [[Ostwind]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (East Wind), the successor was equipped with a single [[3.7 cm FlaK 43]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.achtungpanzer.com/flak4.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book | last = Chamberlain | first = Peter | title = Encyclopedia of German Tanks of World War Two | year = 1999 | publisher = Cassell | pages = 110–111 | isbn = 978-1854095183 | ref = harv }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The combination of armor and rapid fire from the four guns of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wirbelwind&amp;apos;&amp;apos; did make it effective against ground targets.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book | last = Bishop | first = Chris | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Encyclopedia of Weapons of WWII: The Comprehensive Guide to Over 1,500 Weapons Systems, Including Tanks, Small Arms, Warplanes, Artillery, Ships, and Submarines | publisher = Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. | year = 2002 | location = | pages = 166–167 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=MuGsf0psjvcC&amp;amp;lpg=PP1&amp;amp;dq=encyclopedia%20of%20weapons%20of%20world%20war%202&amp;amp;pg=PA166 | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-58663-762-0 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Between 87 and 105 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wirbelwinds&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were produced during the war, but due to discrepancies between the recorded production numbers at the Ostbau Works and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wehrmacht]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; service records, the exact number will probably never be known.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.achtungpanzer.com/flak4.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book | last = Chamberlain | first = Peter | title = Encyclopedia of German Tanks of World War Two | year = 1999 | publisher = Cassell | pages = 110–111 | isbn = 978-1854095183 | ref = harv }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
