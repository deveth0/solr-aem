        text="&lt;p&gt;Article [[David Simpson]] listed on [[WP:VFD]] Apr 26 to May 3 2004, consensus was to delete.  Discussion:

Vanity.  Reads like a resume.  [[User:UninvitedCompany|UninvitedCompany]] 22:36, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Delete. Common name makes it hard to verify, but even the accomplishments claimed on his cv don&amp;apos;t sound too notable. But we should probably also de-link his name, and most the other names at [[Ehmphasis]], or we&amp;apos;ll keep repeating this. [[User:Niteowlneils|Niteowlneils]] 23:12, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Delete.  [[User:RickK|Rick]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[User talk:RickK|K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] 23:22, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Delete.  [[User:Postdlf|Postdlf]] 8:28 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Possibly keep. [[User:Fatal Ruminate|Fatal Ruminate]] Redundant article, subject already covered in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Who&amp;apos;s Who in Canada&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Minor celebrity in Toronto only, not a well-known author. Most likely added due to Ehmphasis connection or due to charity work.
*The court case may be worth keeping if it became a famous case, but other than that I don&amp;apos;t see anything to make him interesting. [[User:Wiwaxia|Wiwaxia]] 07:22, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Delete: vanity, nobody in particular. The so-called &amp;quot;landmark case involving libel/slander on Usenet&amp;quot;, [[Simpson vs. Savoie]], yields 0 hits. Makes me think it wasn&amp;apos;t much of a landmark. [[User:Wile E. Heresiarch|Wile E. Heresiarch]] 08:24, 1 May 2004 (UTC)
