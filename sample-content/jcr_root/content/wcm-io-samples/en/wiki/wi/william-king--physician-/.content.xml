        text="&lt;p&gt;[[File:Dr. William King.jpg|thumb|right|William King]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dr. William King&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (17 April 1786 â€“ 19 October 1865) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] physician and [[philanthropist]] from [[Brighton]]. He is best known as an early supporter of the [[Cooperative|Cooperative Movement]].

By 1827, [[Robert Owen]] had taken his ideas of a co-operative movement to the [[United States]]. But they were picked up and amplified by Dr. King. King founded a cooperative store in Brighton. Then in 1828 he started a paper,&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Co-operator&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The Co-operator URL: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4mATAAAAQAAJ&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; to promote these ideas. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Co-operator&amp;apos;&amp;apos; had a wide circulation and a great influence in the emerging movement. Though only published for slightly over two years, the paper served to educate and unify otherwise scattered groups. King&amp;apos;s articles in the paper gave the movement some philosophical and practical basis that it had lacked before.

King&amp;apos;s overriding rationale for the movement is best illustrated by the phrases repeated on the masthead of every issue of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Co-operator&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;Knowledge and union are power. Power, directed by knowledge is happiness. Happiness is the end of creation.&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

King lived at 23 Montpelier Road in the [[Montpelier, Brighton|Montpelier]] area of Brighton.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;NEB75&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite book|last=Collis|first=Rose|others=(based on the original by Tim Carder)|title=The New Encyclopaedia of Brighton|edition=1st|year=2010|publisher=Brighton &amp;amp; Hove Libraries|location=Brighton|isbn=978-0-9564664-0-2|page=75}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
