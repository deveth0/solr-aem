&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;William Sheridan Allen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (October 5, 1932 - March 14, 2013) was an American historian.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20130319/cityandregion/130319118/1101 |title=William S. Allen, retired UB history professor - City &amp;amp; Region |publisher=The Buffalo News |date=2013-03-19 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Biography==
Allen was born in [[Evanston, Illinois]], and studied at the universities of [[University of Michigan|Michigan]], [[University of Connecticut|Connecticut]], and [[University of Minnesota|Minnesota]], and in Germany at the [[Free University of Berlin]] and the [[University of Göttingen]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Nazi Seizure of Power&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1965) was his first book. He also wrote &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Infancy of Nazism&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and is at work on studies of the effectiveness of Nazi propaganda and of the [[Social Democratic]] underground in the [[Third Reich]]. He is now professor of history at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]].

Allen wrote two books on [[Adolf Hitler]] debunking the point of view that he came to power through violence. Rather, Allen claims, Hitler&amp;apos;s [[Nazism|Nazi]] movement &amp;quot;seized power&amp;quot; in an act akin to democratic tactics.

One of his books, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Nazi Seizure of Power: The Experience of a Single German Town 1922-1945]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was written to explain how one city, ([[Northeim, Germany]]) fell into the Nazi trap. Fed by Nazi propaganda, many people of Northeim, especially in the middle classes, in the midst of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] saw the Nazis as a way to get their country back to greatness that Hitler and the Nazis promised they would do.
