        text="&lt;p&gt;Article [[Drexel Shaft]] listed on [[WP:VFD]] Apr 29 to May 6 2004, consensus was to delete.  Discussion:

Campus slang, with all the hallmarks of a prank entry.  At its best, it would be a private in-joke with the lifespan of a mayfly.  --[[Geogre]]

* Delete. Personal opinions, borderline vanity. &amp;quot;Dude, I put a page called &amp;apos;Drexel Shaft&amp;apos; on Wikipedia! Czech it out!&amp;quot;. [[User:Alcarillo|Alcarillo]] 20:42, 29 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*This is like, you know, like SO totally delete! - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 23:29, 29 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Campus slang and sour grapes. It&amp;apos;s got a one-line mention in [[Drexel University]], and that&amp;apos;s all it needs. -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]]|[[User talk:Cyrius|&amp;amp;#9998]] 02:36, Apr 30, 2004 (UTC)
* I&amp;apos;ve seen this before on [[WP:BJAODN]]. Delete with prejudice. -[[User:Fennec|Fennec]] 03:32, Apr 30, 2004 (UTC)
* Delete. Prank. And delete from [[Drexel University]] page as well. Ridiculous. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 10:43, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Delete as an article. But do not delete from [[Drexel University]] page. &amp;quot;Drexel shaft&amp;quot; in quotes gets over 100 Google hits; &amp;quot;Harvard shaft&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Yale shaft&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Princeton shaft&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Rutgers shaft&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Baylor shaft,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;UConn shaft&amp;quot; and, focussing on the Quaker State, &amp;quot;Villanova shaft&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Swarthmore shaft&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Haverford shaft&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Bryn Mawr shaft&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Carnegie Mellon shaft&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;CMU shaft&amp;quot; get no more than one or two each&amp;amp;mdash. (And those hits often refer things like &amp;quot;Install hydraulic elevator, new CMU shaft&amp;quot;). So... odd as it may seem... and it does seem odd... I&amp;apos;m provisionally inclined to accept the idea that &amp;quot;(university-name-here) shaft&amp;quot; is a) not a campus cultural universal, b) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;is&amp;apos;&amp;apos; a common phrase specifically at Drexel.
