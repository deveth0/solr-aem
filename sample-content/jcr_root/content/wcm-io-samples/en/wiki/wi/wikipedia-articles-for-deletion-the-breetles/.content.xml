Well it needs verifying - the article claims they have released lots of albums. [[User:Secretlondon|Secretlondon]] 01:58, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Keep. There&amp;apos;s a million bands in Wikipedia, why go around deleting one because they&amp;apos;re not &amp;quot;famous&amp;quot; enough? [[User:Stormie|Stormie]] 02:10, Apr 2, 2004 (UTC)

This has been on VfD before, IIRC, and was voted to keep.  [[User:RickK|RickK]] | [[User talk:RickK|Talk]] 03:05, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)

* It just made it &amp;apos;&amp;apos;off&amp;apos;&amp;apos; VfD a little more than a week ago [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;amp;dummy=1&amp;amp;diff=2884594&amp;amp;oldid=2884560].  -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]] | [[User talk:Cyrius|Talk]] 04:15, Apr 2, 2004 (UTC)
**Actually, I seem to remember at least two separate occasions (besides this one) when it was on Vfd. [[User:Meelar|Meelar]] 03:34, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)
**Sorry for the repost, but whoever removes a listing should make sure to move the discussion to the talk page to prevent this sort of thing from happening. - [[User:SimonP|SimonP]] 05:26, Apr 2, 2004 (UTC)
***Keep. Yes, it&amp;apos;s been here and kept at least twice, but there&amp;apos;s no mention of this on the talk page, which is bad because it&amp;apos;s going to keep coming back until there is. So let&amp;apos;s make sure the discussion does get to the talk page this time (assuming it&amp;apos;s kept again). I wish all VfD discussions were this easy and friendly (and see no reason they can&amp;apos;t be). [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 11:10, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)
