        text="&lt;p&gt;This page was created in 2001 and has been at [[X (band)]] since 2002. A few days ago it was moved to [[X (US band)]] and the 30-odd pages linking to it were changed. It was replaced with a &amp;quot;disambiguation&amp;quot; page which actually &amp;apos;&amp;apos;caused&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ambiguity for any external web pages linking there. A disambiguation page is unnecessary, since people aren&amp;apos;t likely to type &amp;quot;X (band)&amp;quot;. Realistically, they&amp;apos;ll go to [[X]]. I compare this to [[Nirvana (band)]]. Although there&amp;apos;re two bands called Nirvana, there&amp;apos;s no need to move it to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nirvana (US band)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. &amp;lt;strike&amp;gt;I don&amp;apos;t think of X as a US band, just a great band.&amp;lt;/strike&amp;gt; Last (and least) this &amp;apos;&amp;apos;X&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is certainly better known than any other X band. For comparison, try a Web search for its singer &amp;quot;Exene Cervenka&amp;quot;. [[User:Mackerm|Mackerm]] 08:40, May 7, 2004 (UTC)

* Keep.  The current setup is clearer.  - [[User:Topbanana|TB]] 08:52, 7 May 2004 (UTC)
** At the top, I state reasons why it&amp;apos;s very much less clear. Would you please address them? [[User:Mackerm|Mackerm]] 21:01, May 8, 2004 (UTC)
***I don&amp;apos;t see it really takes more justification than that. The current setup looks clearer (c.f. [[Pliny]]) - [[User:David Gerard|David Gerard]] 00:35, May 9, 2004 (UTC)
* Keep the page.[[User:Grant65|Grant65]][[User talk: Grant65| (Talk)]] 09:57, May 7, 2004 (UTC)
* Keep the current setup, it&amp;apos;s entirely sensible. - [[User:David Gerard|David Gerard]] 10:37, May 7, 2004 (UTC)
* &amp;lt;s&amp;gt;Keep it as it is. --[[User:Brockert|Ben Brockert]] 21:41, May 7, 2004 (UTC)&amp;lt;/s&amp;gt;
**Keep it as it is, so that [[X (US band)]] can&amp;apos;t be moved back. Whether one is slightly more popular than the other or not doesn&amp;apos;t matter. Items to be disambiguated don&amp;apos;t have to have parity in popularity, they just need to be abmiguous, as [[X (band)]] is. Look at [[Pliny]], for example. [[Pliny the Elder]] is much more well known and has a lot more links than [[Pliny the Younger]], but they are disambiguated as equals, as they should be. --[[User:Brockert|Ben Brockert]] 17:30, May 8, 2004 (UTC)
***[[Wikipedia:Disambiguation#Types of disambiguation|Wikipedia policy]] says if one meaning is clearly predominant, it remains at the general title. At the top I tell how you can determine that. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pliny the Elder&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pliny the Younger&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are their commonly-used names already, so there&amp;apos;s no need to change either of them. [[User:Mackerm|Mackerm]] 00:08, May 10, 2004 (UTC)
****Yeah, but it isn&amp;apos;t &amp;quot;clearly predominant&amp;quot;. Of course a search on Exene Cervenka will turn up the US X, just as a search on Ian Rilen won&amp;apos;t - [[User:David Gerard|David Gerard]] 10:56, May 10, 2004 (UTC)
*****8,450 vs. 283 Google hits speaks for itself. [[User:Mackerm|Mackerm]] 14:17, May 10, 2004 (UTC)
******Yes - it says &amp;quot;more, but hardly so overwhelming as to wipe out the smaller one.&amp;quot; - [[User:David Gerard|David Gerard]] 14:56, May 10, 2004 (UTC)
* Keep it as it is. I agree that nobody is likely to type &amp;quot;X (band)&amp;quot;, but you say yourself that external pages might link there - do you want them to get nothing, or to get this disambiguation page?! --[[User:Stormie|Stormie]] 00:37, May 8, 2004 (UTC)
** I want it deleted so that the original page can be moved back where it was. [[User:Mackerm|Mackerm]] 00:44, May 8, 2004 (UTC)
* Comment- [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Commenting on a deletion request|Wikipedia policy]] says voters should include their reasoning with their opinion. [[User:Mackerm|Mackerm]] 15:35, May 8, 2004 (UTC)
**Is mine better now? --[[User:Brockert|Ben Brockert]] 17:30, May 8, 2004 (UTC)
***It only addresses the stated &amp;apos;&amp;apos;least&amp;apos;&amp;apos; important reason. [[User:Mackerm|Mackerm]] 20:49, May 8, 2004 (UTC)
****Your least important reason isn&amp;apos;t necessarily &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;the&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; least important reason. I can now answer your question from the [[MediaWiki:VfD-X_band|last discussion]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;How do you prevent people from arguing on the VfD page and just vote?&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; You don&amp;apos;t argue with them after they&amp;apos;ve &amp;quot;just&amp;quot; voted, that&amp;apos;s how. --[[User:Brockert|Ben Brockert]] 01:36, May 9, 2004 (UTC)
****Ben, I apologize for sounding argumentative. My intent was to encourage everyone to state his case as completely as possible. Something along the lines of &amp;quot;on this point you&amp;apos;re wrong because XXX, and on this point you&amp;apos;re right, but it&amp;apos;s outweighed because XXX.&amp;quot; My hope is that will keep the discussion focused. [[User:Mackerm|Mackerm]] 20:13, May 9, 2004 (UTC)
* Maybe more X US Band back and add a link at the top to the Aussie one [[User:Burgundavia|Burgundavia]] 07:19, May 13, 2004 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;" />
