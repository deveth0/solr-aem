        text="&lt;p&gt;Vanity, Delete : &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cordiner is a rare surname of French/Spanish derivation from Cordonnier/Cordonier/Cordwainer.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; -- [[User:Chris 73|Chris 73]] | [[User talk:Chris 73|Talk]] 02:20, 9 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete: we don&amp;apos;t need every rare surname added... [[User:Jaredwf|jaredwf]]
*Comment:  Hmmmm... it might be nice if people could come here and find the origin of their surname...? --[[User:Bodnotbod|bodnotbod]] 15:05, May 9, 2004 (UTC)
**Comment: It would probably be better to have pages, like [[Family name etymology]], list surnames instead of having a page devoted for each surname, IMHO. [[User:Jaredwf|jaredwf]] 15:43, 9 May 2004 (UTC)
**Surprised there isn&amp;apos;t a Wiki project or sister site yet. Or is there one and I don&amp;apos;t know about it? [[User:Rhymeless|Rhymeless]] 16:45, 9 May 2004 (UTC)
*Keep, just barely. I find stubs more acceptable if they&amp;apos;re documenting something not trivially easy to find elsewhere. Googling on Cordiner yields plenty of hits, it&amp;apos;s not a rare name. And Googling on &amp;quot;origin of name Cordiner&amp;quot; doesn&amp;apos;t bring up the answer easily in the first few hits. So leaving it it in Wikipedia does make it easier to find than if we deleted it. [[User:Dpbsmith|Dpbsmith]] 01:30, 10 May 2004 (UTC)
* Keep, as it could expand and has real info [[User:Burgundavia|Burgundavia]] 20:07, May 13, 2004 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;" />
