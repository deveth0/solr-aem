        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is an archive of the discussion surrounding the proposed deletion of the pages entitled [[Josh Mirman]] and [[Stubble comic]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is kept as an historic record.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The result of the debate was deletion.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Doubts about inclusion/notability: these two and the two above are uploaded by the one anon [[Special:Contributions/24.185.223.210]], all about college undergrads, which makes it all look like a vanity/friends of vanity attempt.  [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 07:25, 10 May 2004 (UTC)
*Also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ian J]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. --[[User:Stormie|Stormie]] 06:04, May 10, 2004 (UTC)
*Delete. Removed &amp;quot;STORMIE SUCKS!&amp;quot; comment from the [[Mike Krol]] page.   [[User:Jaredwf|jaredwf]] 07:24, 10 May 2004 (UTC)
**I got insulted in an article? I&amp;apos;ve hit the big time! :-) --[[User:Stormie|Stormie]] 09:30, May 10, 2004 (UTC)
*Delete, even though Mike Krol lives to design, but dies to rock. [[User:John Kenney|john]] 08:59, 10 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete. -- [[User:Chris 73|Chris 73]] | [[User talk:Chris 73|Talk]] 11:36, 10 May 2004 (UTC)
*Jeez, all that non-notability &amp;apos;&amp;apos;and&amp;apos;&amp;apos; they attempt to insult a Wikipedian in good standing?  Delete both as vanity and as incapable of creating an insult above the fourth-grade level. - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 15:08, 10 May 2004 (UTC)
*I&amp;apos;m not entirely certain why this page was added, but if it matters to the debate I could also be linked from the [[Asheron&amp;apos;s Call]] page. I currently work at Turbine Entertainment Software and am the Online Community Relations rep for Asheron&amp;apos;s Call. This is probably too trivial for the WikiPedia, but that&amp;apos;s not my decision to make. -- [[User:Cspariah|Cspariah]], 17:15, 10 May 2004 (UTC)
**Thanks for bringing it to my attention; I&amp;apos;ve de-wikispammed it. Oh and delete the other two pages. [[User:Alcarillo|Alcarillo]] 19:25, 10 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete both: vanity, nonnotable. [[User:Wile E. Heresiarch|Wile E. Heresiarch]] 04:47, 12 May 2004 (UTC)
