        text="&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;apos;t an encyclopedia article; just two song lyrics (source document) And for that matter the first lyric is already provided in the [[Horst Wessel Lied]] article and the title of the second lyric isn&amp;apos;t provided.[[User:AndyL|AndyL]] 17:52, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Delete or fill in missing information in English.  There may be additional Nazi Songs that might be worth cataloging, and this article might be able to serve as a good stub for further such additions.  Still, if all future songs were entered with the same types of missing song titles and missing title translations, they would be needlessly disorganized and difficult for most readers to understand.

* Has been redirected to [[Nazi Songs]], I say keep as redirect. -- [[User:Francs2000|Graham  :)]] | [[User talk:Francs2000|Talk]] 22:03, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)
**I agree with the redirect.  [[User:RickK|Rick]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[User talk:RickK|K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] 23:26, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)
**Agree with redirect. Merge what is appropriate. In fact, I would even go one further, move most of it to wikisource and only keep some relevant quotes. This might invite an article &amp;apos;on&amp;apos; Nazi songs. [[User:Sander123|Sander123]] 07:43, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)
**Keep.  I have added the songs to show the leftist character of Nazism.  It says  to fight &amp;quot;Red Front&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Reaction&amp;quot;.  Reaction is the aristocracy.[[User:WHEELER|WHEELER]] 14:01, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;" />
