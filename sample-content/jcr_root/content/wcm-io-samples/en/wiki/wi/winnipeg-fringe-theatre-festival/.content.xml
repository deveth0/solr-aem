The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an annual [[Fringe theatre|alternative theatre festival]] held in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]]. It is held over twelve days and it is common for a small number of shows to be held over past the festival&amp;apos;s official end date. The most recent Winnipeg Fringe ran from July 18 to 29, 2012.

Founded in 1988 by the [[Manitoba Theatre Centre]] under the directorship of [[Rick McNair]], it is one of Winnipeg&amp;apos;s most popular cultural events. The executive producer is currently Chuck McEwen, former director of the [[Toronto Fringe Festival]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Melissa Martin, &amp;quot;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/story/4201486p-4793358c.html We asked ... Chuck McEwen]&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Winnipeg Free Press]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 20 July 2008.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The festival takes place in various venues throughout Winnipeg&amp;apos;s historic [[Exchange District]]. In recent years, total attendance has generally been around or just under 150,000, with paid attendance usually around 30% of that figure (in contrast to less than 10% for some other similar festivals). It features many local groups who may not otherwise have the opportunity to reach an audience, as well as others from all over the globe; for example, the 2005 festival featured performers from [[France]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and [[South Africa]] as well as performers from across [[Canada]] and the [[United States|U.S.]].

However, the Edmonton Fringe festival currently holds the North American record for 2011 with 104,142 tickets sold.

Like its Edmonton counterpart, on which it was largely modeled, but unlike the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], the Winnipeg Fringe provides a number of venues for the performers, including paid technicians as well as volunteer ticket sellers, ushers and other such functionaries. It is also possible - and increasingly popular - for performers to &amp;quot;bring their own venue&amp;quot; by making arrangements with a potential venue other than the ones the festival provides, a process much more similar to that of the Edinburgh fringe.

Many Canadian Fringe Festival artists have enjoyed continued success, based on productions they first mounted at Fringe Festivals. [[TJ Dawe]] (The Slip-Knot), Charles Ross ([[One Man Star Wars]]), Ribbit Productions (BoyGroove), and Monster Theatre (The Canada Show), have all performed over several years in Winnipeg.



Following three key principles the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fringe Festival&amp;apos;&amp;apos; continues focus solely on its performers :

1. Festival is non-juried

2. Artists have freedom to present whatever they want on stage.

3. 100% of the box office goes directly to the artists. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.winnipegfringe.com/About-Us-Contact-%281%29.aspx&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
