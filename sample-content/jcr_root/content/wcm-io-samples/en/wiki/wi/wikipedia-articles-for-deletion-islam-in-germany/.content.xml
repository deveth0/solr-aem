**I has now (April 7) been greatly expanded and turned into a useful article. - [[User:SimonP|SimonP]] 23:52, Apr 7, 2004 (UTC)

There is lots that could be written on this - headscarf bans etc. [[User:Secretlondon|Secretlondon]] 01:57, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Lots could be written on this, but unless something is in the next five days, I say delete. [[User:Warofdreams|Warofdreams]] 16:06, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)

* Keep. Important topic. WP is a WIP. [[User:Wile E. Heresiarch|Wile E. Heresiarch]] 03:32, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Added VfD notice - Delete. [[Wikipedia:Pages needing translation into English|Pages needing translation into English]] policy gives two weeks for translation, and this page&amp;apos;s time is up. -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]]|[[User talk:Cyrius|&amp;amp;#9998]] 17:16, Apr 4, 2004 (UTC)

* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Keep&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - as noted above, this is a topic that can be greatly expanded and has relevance. This is a very usefully stub for further expansion and no need for some arbitrary 5 day timeline for said expansion. [[User:Lestatdelc|Lestatdelc]] 22:18, Apr 7, 2004 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;" />
