9-11 victims not otherwise notable. [[User:DJ Clayworth|DJ Clayworth]] 21:07, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Keep. Not notable for anything aside from 9/11, but 9/11 is enough. [[User:Everyking|Everyking]] 23:01, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Delete like the others. - [[User:SimonP|SimonP]] 23:10, Apr 16, 2004 (UTC)
*Delete. 9/11 is NOT enough, unless we&amp;apos;re going to rename this project USAPedia. Besides, keeping these articles and others like them implies that an article should be written on anyone else who has ever been a casualty of any non-war event. [[User:Jeeves|Jeeves]] 00:27, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)
**No it doesn&amp;apos;t. It implies that when a society attaches particular importance to the deaths of certain people, articles should be written about them. [[User:Everyking|Everyking]] 00:40, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*** &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Society&amp;apos;&amp;apos; attaches no importance to the deaths of these particular people. Importance was attached to the fact that people died at all. Who they were was almost irrelevant. Memorial and delete. -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]]|[[User talk:Cyrius|&amp;amp;#9998]] 01:09, Apr 17, 2004 (UTC)
*Delete. [[User:SWAdair|SWAdair]] | [[User talk:SWAdair|Talk ]] 04:45, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)

* Move to [http://www.sep11.wikipedia.org sep11 wiki] and delete. [[User:Maximus Rex|Maximus Rex]] 04:58, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)

*Keep.  Whether or not they&amp;apos;re notable doesn&amp;apos;t matter, but in this case they are. [[User:Anthony DiPierro|anthony]] [[User:Anthony_DiPierro/warning|(see warning)]]
