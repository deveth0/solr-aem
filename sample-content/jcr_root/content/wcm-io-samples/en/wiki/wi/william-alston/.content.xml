&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;William Payne Alston&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (November 29, 1921, [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] â€“ September 13, 2009, [[Jamesville, New York]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://obits.syracuse.com/obituaries/syracuse/obituary.aspx?n=william-payne-alston&amp;amp;pid=133187512|title=William Payne Alston|publisher=[[The Post-Standard]]|date=September 20, 2009|accessdate=May 13, 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) was an American philosopher. He made influential contributions to the [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]] and [[Christian philosophy]]. He earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Chicago]] and taught at [[Syracuse University]], [[Rutgers University]] and the [[University of Michigan]].

His views on [[foundationalism]], [[internalism and externalism|internalism versus externalism]], [[illocutionary act|speech acts]], and the epistemic value of mystical experience, among many other topics, have been very influential.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;See the article on Alston by Daniel Howard-Snyder in Graham Oppy and Nick Trakakis, eds. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Twentieth-Century Philosophy of Religion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, vol. 5 of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;History of Western Philosophy of Religion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Acumen 2013. ISBN 9781844656851.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Like most American philosophers, Alston is counted among the [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]].

Together with [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]], and [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]], Alston helped to found the journal &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Faith and Philosophy]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the Society of Christian Philosophers. With Plantinga, Wolterstorff, and others, Alston was also responsible for the development of &amp;quot;[[Reformed epistemology]]&amp;quot; (a term that Alston, an Episcopalian, never fully endorsed), one of the most important contributions to Christian thought in the twentieth century. Alston was president of the [[American Philosophical Association]] in 1979 and was widely recognized as one of the core figures in the late twentieth-century revival of the philosophy of religion. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1990.&amp;lt;ref name=AAAS&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=15 April 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Alston died at his home on September 13, 2009.
