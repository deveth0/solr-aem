* Obvious delete.  [[User:Ensiform|Ensiform]] 04:35, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Delete. [[User:Cribcage|Cribcage]] 06:38, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Delete - vanity - soon this will change from Wikipedia to Wikiresume - [[User:Texture|T&amp;amp;#949;x]][[User Talk:Texture|&amp;lt;font color=red&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#964;&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;]][[User:Texture|ur&amp;amp;#949;]] 15:07, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Delete; obvious vanity article. &amp;amp;mdash;[[User:Psychonaut|Psychonaut]] 15:33, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*All this and a &amp;quot;part drummer&amp;quot; as well!  I shudder to think which part, however.  PLEASE delete.  [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 20:46, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Delete. Who&amp;apos;s that? -- [[User:CdaMVvWgS|CdaMVvWgS]] 09:31, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* By its own admission this article (unless edited otherwise) is going to have to be deleted.  It talks about Brennan as &amp;quot;up-and-coming&amp;quot;, fails to list anything he&amp;apos;s done except his plans for the future.  --[[User:Daniel C. Boyer|Daniel C. Boyer]] 16:01, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Delete. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;So&amp;apos;&amp;apos; delete, unless it turns out that &amp;quot;part drumming&amp;quot; involves going on tour with [[R.E.M. (band)|REM]] or something.
*Keep if verifiable. [[User:Anthony DiPierro|anthony]] [[User:Anthony_DiPierro/warning|(see warning)]]&lt;/p&gt;" />
