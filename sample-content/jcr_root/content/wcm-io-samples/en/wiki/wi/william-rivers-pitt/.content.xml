        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;William Rivers Pitt&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born November 9, 1971) is an author, editor, and political activist.

==Background==
Pitt was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], and lived several years in [[Alabama]] (where his father, [[Charles Redding Pitt]], served as  [[chairman|chair]] of the state [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]) before eventually moving to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. He was educated in [[English literature]] at [[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross College]], a Catholic college in Massachusetts, and after graduation spent two years in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] doing law-related work.  Formerly, Pitt taught [[English literature]], [[journalism]], [[grammar]], and [[history]] at a small [[private school]] outside Boston.  He set aside teaching in 2003 and became a full-time professional writer.

==Writing career==
Pitt had been writing about politics off and on for several years, but became devoted to the practice during the [[impeachment]] [[trial (law)|trial]] of former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]]. Since President [[George W. Bush]] took office on January 20, 2001, Pitt has worked to fight what he describes as &amp;quot;the rising tide of conservative [[fundamentalism]] in American government&amp;quot;.

In 2002, Pitt wrote the book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn&amp;apos;t Want You to Know]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which consisted of an in-depth interview with former [[United Nations Special Commission|United Nations weapons inspector]] [[Scott Ritter]]. In it, Pitt and Ritter examine the Bush administration&amp;apos;s justifications for war with Iraq and call for a diplomatic solution instead of war. In reviewing this book, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Guardian]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; called it &amp;quot;the most comprehensive independent analysis of the state of knowledge about Iraq&amp;apos;s weapons programmes until the new team of inspectors went back.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;gua030125&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Pitt currently works as a managing editor and columnist at the liberal commentary website truthout.org.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;truthout_bio&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Political activism==
In January 2004, Pitt took over for [[David Swanson]] as the Press Secretary for [[Dennis Kucinich]], who was seeking the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]&amp;apos;s nomination in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.denniskucinich.us/index.php?topic=General&amp;amp;page=7 dennis4president.com - Home&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Following his involvement in the Kucinich campaign, Pitt decided to push his career in teaching to the side in order to focus on political activism.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;tru050908&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; As a result, he joined the staff of [[Progressive Democrats of America]] in 2005 as their Editorial director.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://pdamerica.org/postcards/2005-04-23-pitt-will.php Audio Postcard from Mimi Kennedy - Progressive Democrats of America&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
