==Biography==
Gates was a teenager from the [[Cabrini–Green]] housing projects.  He and [[Arthur Agee]], from [[West Garfield Park]], hoped to hone their [[basketball]] talent into professional careers with the [[NBA]]. The documentary Hoop Dreams followed them through their recruitment by [[St. Joseph High School (Westchester, Illinois)|St. Joseph High School]]. During high school, he worked hard both to improve his basketball skills and his academics to the best of his ability, though he initially struggled with a low reading level. He struggled to get the required score of an 18 on the [[ACT (examination)|ACT exam]] needed to earn a scholarship at [[Marquette University]], but finally managed a 17.5 aggregate score, which was rounded up to 18. At St. Joseph, Gates suffered a knee injury which limited his playing and recruitment offers. After he had a kid and left  Marquette, with out graduating, he went to Loyola University in Chicago where he still did not graduate.  He became a community liaison to the new development in Cabri-Green.    Gates would go on to give back to the community as senior pastor at Living Faith Community Center in [[Cabrini-Green|Cabrini–Green]], where he works at the Kids&amp;apos; Club.

In 2001, Gates worked out with NBA star [[Michael Jordan]] in preparation for Jordan&amp;apos;s comeback and was offered a tryout with the [[Washington Wizards]], but injured his foot. His brother, Curtis Gates, also seen in the film, was murdered on September 10, 2001.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27976-2004Jul4_4.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Looking Back At Broken &amp;apos;Dreams&amp;apos; | date=5 July 2004}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
