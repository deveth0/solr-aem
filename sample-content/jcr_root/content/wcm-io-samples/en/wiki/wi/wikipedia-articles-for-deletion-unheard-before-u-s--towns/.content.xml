*I vote to delete all small U.S. towns on the basis that they destroy the functionality of the Random link. [[User:666|666]] 20:38, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*You&amp;apos;ll have to list every single one you want deleted, but I don&amp;apos;t think you want to do that.  Keep all.[[User:RickK|RickK]] | [[User talk:RickK|Talk]] 20:44, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC)
*Keep all. Someone from one of these &amp;quot;unheard of&amp;quot; towns could come along and add some useful and intresting information about their town. Besides, what constitutes as &amp;quot;small&amp;quot;? 1,000? 10,000? 50,000? [[User:Rainier Schmidt|Rainier Schmidt]] 20:48, Mar 28, 2004 (UTC)
*This request is inmpossible because, as Rainier says, you haven&amp;apos;t specified what you mean by &amp;quot;small&amp;quot;. If you said &amp;quot;all towns with less than 10 people&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;all towns with less than 100 people&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;all towns with less than 10,000 people&amp;quot; or whatever, then that would be a debatable suggestion (although I&amp;apos;d personally vote against it).

*Keep - [[Special:Randompage|random page]] works fine for me -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]] | [[User talk:Cyrius|Talk]] 22:16, Mar 28, 2004 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;" />
