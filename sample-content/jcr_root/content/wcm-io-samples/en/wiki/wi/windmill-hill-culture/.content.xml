        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Windmill Hill culture&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a name given to a people inhabiting southern [[Prehistoric Britain|Britain]], in particular in the [[Salisbury Plain]] area close to [[Stonehenge]], c. [[3000 BC]]. They were an [[agrarian]] [[Neolithic]] people; their name comes from [[Windmill Hill]], a causewayed camp. Together with another Neolithic tribe from [[East Anglia]], a tribe whose worship involved stone circles, it is thought that they were responsible for the earliest work on the Stonehenge site.

The material record left by these people includes large circular hill-top enclosures, [[causewayed camp]]s, [[long barrow]]s, leaf-shaped arrowheads and polished stone axes. They raised cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs, grew wheat and mined flints.

Since the term was first coined by [[archaeologists]], further excavation and analysis has indicated that it consisted of several discrete [[archaeological culture|cultures]] such as the [[Hembury]]  and the [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]] [[culture]]s; and that &amp;quot;Windmill Hill culture&amp;quot; is too general a term.
