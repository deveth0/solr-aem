Vanity and what passes for wit in the mind of the contemporary student. VfD also on [[Thomas Taylor]] and [[Robert Westwood]], the alleged Superheros. Meanwhile I&amp;apos;ll check the author&amp;apos;s other edits... --[[User:Tagishsimon|Tagishsimon]]

* Delete. Vanity. - [[User:MykReeve|MykReeve]] 13:31, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
* Delete. I agree with MykReeve [[User:EddEdmondson|EddEdmondson]] 13:41, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
* I guess you&amp;apos;d have to really know more about the culture at the University of Wolverhampton.  But you don&amp;apos;t, do you?
** Correct. I don&amp;apos;t, but I think that&amp;apos;s irrelevant to the issue of whether or not these articles are suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia. - [[User:MykReeve|MykReeve]] 14:54, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
** Note: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia&amp;amp;diff=3604163&amp;amp;oldid=3604070 vandalism] is unlikely to help your case. [[User:Grendelkhan|Grendelkhan]] 16:56, 2004 May 16 (UTC)
**Comment: No, I don&amp;apos;t think we do need to know. The article speaks for itself. [[user:andrewa/minimum waste of time|MWOT]]. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 20:09, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Delete&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  Article is not of general interest.  Lack of googlespoor makes it impossible to easily verify. - [[User:Topbanana|TB]] 15:15, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
* Delete. Joke, probable vanity. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 19:29, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete and move to BJAODN. --[[User:Beelzebubs|Beelzebubs]] 19:35, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
*And these people are allegedly adults?  Delete.  [[User:RickK|Rick]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[User talk:RickK|K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] 20:47, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete.  The mention of people citing Wikipedia articles in chatrooms in the edit above warms the cockles of my heart, however. [[User:Meelar|Meelar]] 20:55, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
* Delete them all. Not funny enough for BJAODN. -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]]|[[User talk:Cyrius|&amp;amp;#9998]] 21:38, May 16, 2004 (UTC)
*Vanity. Delete. Unless, prior to end of deletion debate, someone adds to the article clear, convincing, and verifiable evidence of the notability of the &amp;quot;Superheros.&amp;quot; [[User:Dpbsmith|Dpbsmith]] 22:38, 16 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete. Unverifiable. [[User:Andris|Andris]] 01:02, May 17, 2004 (UTC)
*Delete.  Non-notable. --[[User:Starx|Starx]] 01:41, 17 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete all.  Agree with [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]]. - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 16:28, 17 May 2004 (UTC)
