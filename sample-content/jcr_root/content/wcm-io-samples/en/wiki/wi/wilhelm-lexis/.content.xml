&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wilhelm Lexis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (July 17, 1837, [[Eschweiler]] – October 25, 1914, [[Göttingen]]), full name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wilhelm Hector Richard Leberecht Lexis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was an eminent [[Germany|German]] [[statistician]], [[economist]], and social scientist and a founder of the [[interdisciplinary]] study of [[insurance]].

Born in Eschweiler as the son of a physician, Lexis obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Physics]] from the [[University of Heidelberg]], where he was an assistant of the famous [[Chemist]] [[Robert Bunsen]]. He then worked as a [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] [[teacher]], [[librarian]], and [[journalist]], until in 1872 he became, until 1874, [[Professor|extraordinary professor]] at the newly-refounded German-language [[German Empire|Imperial]] [[University of Strassburg|University of Straßburg]].  In 1874-1876, he taught at the [[University of Tartu]], then at the [[University of Freiburg]] im Breisgau, since 1884 at the [[Wroclaw University|University of Breslau]], and from 1887 at the [[Georg August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]], which was his final appointment. He died in [[Göttingen]].

Although the author of an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Allgemeine Volkswirtschaftslehre&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (general economics  book) (1910) and certainly a distinguished [[economist]], even a pioneer of [[Law and economics|Law and Economics]] thinking and of the study of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] and [[crisis|crises]], Lexis is today primarily known as a [[statistician]], partially due to his creation of the [[Lexis ratio]]. His reputation as a [[demographer]] is underlined by the ubiquity of [[Lexis_diagram|Lexis Diagrams]], which are named for him, although primary credit for their invention belongs to [[Gustav Zeuner]] and O. Brasche&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal | last= Vanderschrick | first = Christophe | title=The Lexis diagram, a misnomer| journal= Demographic Research| volume =4| url=http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol4/3/4-3.pdf | issue= 3}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; (a notable example of [[Stigler&amp;apos;s law of eponymy]]). He is also one of the founding fathers of the interdisciplinary, professional study of [[insurance]]. A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Kathedersozialist]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, he was closely affiliated with academic policy makers in [[Prussia]] and one of [[Friedrich Althoff]]’s experts and the editor of important works on German higher education, most famously the six-volume &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Das Unterrichtswesen im Deutschen Reich&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, compiled for the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] [[World&amp;apos;s Fair]] of that year and still the key reference work for that time. Lexis&amp;apos; theoretical works on social science [[epistemology]] are largely forgotten but very relevant today.
