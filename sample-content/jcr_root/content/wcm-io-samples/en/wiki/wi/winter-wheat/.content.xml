&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Winter wheat&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Common wheat|Triticum aestivum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a crop [[plant]] that is cultivated from September to December in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Winter wheat sprouts before freezing occurs, then becomes dormant until the soil warms in the spring. Winter wheat needs a few weeks of cold before being able to flower, however persistent [[snow]] cover might be disadvantageous.  It is ready to be harvested by early July. Due to the timing of  the plant&amp;apos;s growth and maturation, winter wheat is valued as a cold crop that can be planted right after the harvest in the fall.

Hard winter wheats have a higher [[gluten]] protein content than other wheats.  They are used to make flour for [[yeast]] [[bread]]s, or are blended with soft spring wheats to make the all-purpose [[flour]] used in a wide variety of baked products. Soft wheat is used for specialty or cake flour. [[Durum]], the hardest wheat, is primarily used for making [[pasta]].  Almost all durum wheat grown in North America is spring-planted.

Winter wheat is grown throughout [[Europe]], [[North America]], and in [[Siberia]].
==United States==
Winter wheat was brought to [[Kansas]] by German-[[Russian Mennonite]]s in the 19th century.{{fact|date=September 2012}} Bernhard Warkentin and [[Mark A. Carleton]] played a major part in the spread of winter wheat as a commercial crop. Warkentin organized mills in central Kansas and imported seed from [[Ukraine]] to meet growing demand.  Carleton worked for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) as a crop explorer.  He went to [[Russia]] to find other wheat varieties and worked with [[Kansas State University]] researchers to develop new ones.  Winter wheat production quickly spread throughout the [[Great Plains]], and was, as it still is, usually grown using the techniques of [[dryland farming]].
