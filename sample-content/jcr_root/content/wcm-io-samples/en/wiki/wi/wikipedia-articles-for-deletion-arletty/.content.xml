&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is an archive of the discussion surrounding the proposed deletion of the page entitled [[Arletty]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is kept as an historic record.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The result of the debate was to keep the article.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Only &amp;apos;&amp;apos;narrowly&amp;apos;&amp;apos; misses criteria for speedy delete.  One line of geneological data, no description of why they are notable, and three external links, two of which are to Google-translated versions of a web page.

* I&amp;apos;ve reworked the stub.  - [[User:Topbanana|TB]] 11:39, 11 May 2004 (UTC)
* Keep. Now a good stub. Well done. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 13:40, 11 May 2004 (UTC)
* I would even put this on [[Wikipedia:Pages needing attention|Needing Attention]]. [[User:Alcarillo|Alcarillo]] 14:12, 11 May 2004 (UTC)
* Looks like a stub. Keep -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]]|[[User talk:Cyrius|&amp;amp;#9998]] 23:26, May 11, 2004 (UTC)
*In a few short hours this went from nearly speedy delete to an excellent stub.  A keeper! - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 00:06, 12 May 2004 (UTC)
* I just got back online and found the changes.  Great job.  Keep new version.  [[User:SWAdair|SWAdair]] | [[User talk:SWAdair|Talk ]] 03:22, 12 May 2004 (UTC)
