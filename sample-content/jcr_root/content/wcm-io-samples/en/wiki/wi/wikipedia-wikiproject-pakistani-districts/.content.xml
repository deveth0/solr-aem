The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;WikiProject Pakistani Districts&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, this article provides a guideline to write articles about the [[Districts of Pakistan|Pakistan districts]] in the four provinces, namely,  [[Sindh]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[North West Frontier Province]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]].
