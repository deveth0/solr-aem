&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is an archive of the discussion surrounding the proposed deletion of the page entitled [[Moanalua High School]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is kept as an historic record.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Consensus of the discussion was to delete the article. However, the page underwent a massive expansion in the time between the last comment and the evaluation of the article&amp;apos;s status.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;In addition, the discussion&amp;apos;s result is in conflict with proposed policy and consensus at [[Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy/schools]]. As a result, the article was kept.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

[[Moanalua High School]] is a non-notable secondary school.  I believe our present policy is that such articles are deleted.  [[User:UninvitedCompany|UninvitedCompany]] 21:54, 17 May 2004 (UTC)
*You are wrong about our present policy. Keep. [[User:Everyking|Everyking]] 22:15, 17 May 2004 (UTC)
**Everyking is quite right.  Our present policy is to include all manners of nonsense which should be summarily deleted.  [[User:RickK|Rick]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[User talk:RickK|K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] 22:47, 17 May 2004 (UTC)
***Actually, the page where policy is being discussed is [[Wikipedia_talk:Deletion_policy/schools]], but I don&amp;apos;t see any clear consensus. My own thoughts are at [[User:Dpbsmith/schools]] [[User:Dpbsmith|Dpbsmith]] 00:05, 18 May 2004 (UTC)
*I&amp;apos;m far from a deletionist, but secondary schools are where I draw the line.  I would support a change of policy--I think I missed this one. [[User:Meelar|Meelar]] 23:02, 17 May 2004 (UTC)
*Keep. I generally vote against secondary schools, but because this article &amp;apos;&amp;apos;at least&amp;apos;&amp;apos; mentions &amp;apos;&amp;apos;one&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;reasonably notable&amp;apos;&amp;apos; alumna, a [[Miss America]] winner on which there is an OK article (by same author, [[User:Gerald_Farinas]])... and because in [[Wikipedia_talk:Deletion_policy/schools]] I said that in the case of a school that is mentioned in another article, for some reasonably significant reason, like the biography of an actor, politician or scientist who merits inclusion, I&amp;apos;d &amp;quot;keep if created, don&amp;apos;t encourage creation&amp;quot;... I&amp;apos;m going to say keep. I think a Miss America winner is just barely notable enough for a separate article and I think &amp;apos;&amp;apos;one&amp;apos;&amp;apos; just barely notable alumna isn&amp;apos;t really quite enough to warrant an article on a secondary school, but, &amp;quot;keep if created, don&amp;apos;t encourage creation&amp;quot; is what I said so &amp;quot;keep if created, don&amp;apos;t encourage creation&amp;quot; is how I&amp;apos;ll vote. I just looked at [[User:Gerald_Farinas]]&amp;apos;s contribution list. He appears to have started &amp;apos;&amp;apos;today,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and in one day appears to have originated five or six short articles. It looks to me as if he&amp;apos;s probably writing about things he knows personally (good) which are marginally notable (not so good), and doing a workmanlike job (good).

* Delete. Miss America isn&amp;apos;t significant enough to spark off creation of pages related to her. If she goes on to be elected as state governor, or wins a Nobel prize, then we can create the page. [[User:Average Earthman|Average Earthman]] 15:27, 18 May 2004 (UTC)
* Delete: not notable. Agreed w/ Average Earthman. [[User:Wile E. Heresiarch|Wile E. Heresiarch]] 02:41, 19 May 2004 (UTC)
