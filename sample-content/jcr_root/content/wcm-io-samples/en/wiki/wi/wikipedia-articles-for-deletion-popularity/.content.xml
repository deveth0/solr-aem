*This article is nothing but an extended definition. It might be appropriate for the Wiktionary, but not for the Wikipedia.[[User:Leland|Leland]] 23:06, 11 May 2004 (UTC)
*It looks fine to me.  It includes more than just a definition.  [[User:Spencer195|&amp;amp;#9758;spencer195]] 23:09, 11 May 2004 (UTC)
*Keep. The social phenomenon of &amp;quot;popularity&amp;quot; is of widespread interest and has almost certainly been the subject of academic study. -- [[User:Seth Ilys|Seth Ilys]] 06:32, 12 May 2004 (UTC)
*If no one can cite one of these academic studies, I&amp;apos;d say it&amp;apos;s a pointless entry. [[User:Leland|Leland]] 12:42, 12 May 2004 (UTC)
*I say let it go. After giving a wide open definition of popularity as many people liking an “entity/object,” it goes with what look like personal observations on popularity, but only as it applies to people and not other “entities/objects.” Seems a bit trivial. [[User:Nathan Hamblen|Nathan]] 13:19, 12 May 2004 (UTC)
* Keep.  It&amp;apos;s already more then a definition and has the potential to be expanded into a fuller article.  Add a stub message if you&amp;apos;d like, but keep. --[[User:Starx|Starx]] 04:52, 13 May 2004 (UTC)
* Keep.  It has promise. -- [[User:Stevietheman|Stevietheman]] 00:57, 15 May 2004 (UTC)
