        text="&lt;p&gt;*Delete. Appears to be a personal page.  Google search turns up next to nil. -- [[User:Tbjablin|Tbjablin]] 01:00, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*This one&amp;apos;s actually amusing. And nonsense!. Delete. [[User:Pteron|Pteron]] 01:29, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*This is actually rather sad.  Delete, though.  [[User:RickK|Rick]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[User talk:RickK|K&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] 02:38, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)
**Amusing because it&amp;apos;s so pathetic... ah, what do these people think? [[User:Pteron|Pteron]] 03:42, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)
*Delete.  Please?  Pretty please?  - [[User:Lucky 6.9|Lucky 6.9]] 02:43, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Delete -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]]|[[User talk:Cyrius|&amp;amp;#9998]] 04:11, Apr 20, 2004 (UTC)
* Delette. Pretty pretty please? With sugar on top? -- [[User:Rjsc]]
* This is either going to make some girl very happy or freak the shit out of her.  Either way, delete.  [[User:Exploding Boy|Exploding Boy]] 06:15, Apr 20, 2004 (UTC)
** I&amp;apos;d bet $20 the latter. [[User:Mike Church|Mike Church]] 20:58, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Delete.  Or redirect to [[unrequited love]].  [[User:Postdlf|Postdlf]]  6:27 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)
** Or [[masturbating while crying]], if it still exists... [[User:Mike Church|Mike Church]] 20:58, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Delete. [[User:Cribcage|Cribcage]] 06:40, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* I&amp;apos;m sure she&amp;apos;s sweet, but still delete. Actually I&amp;apos;m not sure at all, how could I be? The point is made above that we don&amp;apos;t know the background of such articles. They may be romantic, abusive, or lots of other things. Just one of many reasons not to accept unverifiable material. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 06:41, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Delete. Poorly written piece of garbage, and it makes me ill. [[User:Mike Church|Mike Church]] 20:58, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)
* Delete. Very funny. I laughed out loud. -- [[User:Tjdw|Tjdw]] 03:53, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;" />
