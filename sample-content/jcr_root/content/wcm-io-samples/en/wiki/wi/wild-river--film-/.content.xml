&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wild River&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 1960 film directed by [[Elia Kazan]] starring [[Montgomery Clift]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Jo Van Fleet]], [[Albert Salmi]] and [[Jay C. Flippen]] filmed on location in the [[Tennessee Valley]]. It was adapted by [[Paul Osborn]] from two novels – [[Borden Deal]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dunbar&amp;apos;s Cove&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and [[William Bradford Huie]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mud on the Stars&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 2002, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wild River&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being &amp;quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&amp;quot;.

==Plot==
A young idealistic [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] administrator, Chuck Glover ([[Montgomery Clift]]), comes to a small town in [[Tennessee]] to enforce the clearing of the land to be flooded by a new dam on the [[Tennessee River]] in the early 1930s. An aging 80-year-old matriarch, Ella Garth ([[Jo Van Fleet]] who was only 45 at the time), refuses to sell her land to the federal government, and the film anticipates much of the environmental debates concerning the artificial control of rivers.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/117078/Wild-River/overview | work=The New York Times | title=Movies: About Wild River | first=A.H. | last=Weiler}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Glover falls in love with the matriarch&amp;apos;s granddaughter, Carol Garth Baldwin ([[Lee Remick]]).

The film also portrays some of the racial issues in the [[Southern United States|South]] after the Great Depression.

==Production==
Exterior locations for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wild River&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were filmed on Coon Denton Island on the [[Hiwassee River]], near [[Charleston, Tennessee]]; in the town&amp;apos;s old business district; and on a peninsula west of [[Cleveland, Tennessee]], on [[Chickamauga Lake]]. A studio for interior shooting was also created in the Cleveland armory.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;TED STRONGINCHARLESTON, TENN..  &amp;quot;CHARTING A &amp;apos;WILD RIVER,&amp;apos; TENNESSEE-STYLE :Real Sites, Citizens Add to Flavor Of T.V.A.
