This is a listing of images which never uploaded properly and have zero size. This list was last updated [[22 September]] [[2004]] from the live database.

==What to do==
Suggested guidelines for dealing with these (by [[User:Delirium]]):
*When you can verify that the images were re-uploaded with another filename, delete them, with the deletion comment containing the new filename.
*With zero-byte images added by regular contributors, but which you cannot verify having been re-uploaded, delete them and leave a message on the contributor&amp;apos;s talk page with the filename and its former caption, so they can re-upload if they have a copy still.
*With zero-byte images added by no-longer-active users, delete them.
*With zero-byte images added by regular contributors and having some significant amount of material on the image description page beyond the one-line caption (e.g., copyright information), leave the page there and leave a note on the user&amp;apos;s talk page.
*When there exists a non-zero-byte old revision, revert to it.
*Remember that the lack of a link to the image in the image description does not mean the image is unused - those links are routinely incomplete. You&amp;apos;ll need to use the site search to find every place where it is used in en. Even that won&amp;apos;t find non-en uses.

If you are not a sysop and want an image deleted, you should list it on [[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion]]. See that page for further instructions.

Images that have been deleted or successfully re-uploaded can be removed from this list.

==How to update==
The SQL query for updating this list is:

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;
SELECT concat(&amp;apos;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;small&amp;gt;&amp;apos;, img_timestamp, &amp;apos;&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;[[User talk:&amp;apos;, img_user_text,
   &amp;apos;|t]] [[User:&amp;apos;, img_user_text, &amp;apos;|&amp;apos;, img_user_text, &amp;apos;]]&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;small&amp;gt;[[:Image:&amp;apos;, img_name,
   &amp;apos;]]&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&amp;apos;, img_description)
FROM image
WHERE img_size=0
ORDER BY img_timestamp
&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

Run the query and copy and paste the result into the table.

==The list==

The list is empty at the moment.
