&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;William Joseph Parnell MacMillan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (March 24, 1881 &amp;amp;ndash; December 7, 1957) was a physician and [[Prince Edward Island]] politician.

Born in [[Clermont, Prince Edward Island|Clermont]], MacMillan was a graduate of [[Prince of Wales College]] and the [[McGill University]] Faculty of Medicine.

After running a medical practice for several years, MacMillan entered politics in [[Prince Edward Island general election, 1923|1923]] winning a [[Legislative seat|seat]] in the provincial [[legislative assembly]] as a [[PEI Conservative Party|Conservative]]. In 1932 he became the province&amp;apos;s first minister of health and education.  As minister he rebuilt [[Prince of Wales College]] and the Provincial Mental Hospital which had both been destroyed by fire. He also secured a [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] endowment that enabled the government to establish a provincial library system.

When [[James D. Stewart]] became ill, MacMillan served as acting premier and then became the [[List of premiers of Prince Edward Island|18th]] [[Premier of Prince Edward Island|Premier]] when Stewart died in 1933. MacMillan&amp;apos;s government implemented relief programs and increasing government spending to help dampen the impact of the [[Great Depression]]. Nevertheless, his government was swept from power in the [[Prince Edward Island general election, 1935|1935 election]] which saw the Liberals capture every seat in the legislature. He returned to the legislature in [[Prince Edward Island general election, 1939|1939]] and remained leader of the Conservative Party until the late 1940s and a member of the legislature until he lost his seat in the [[Prince Edward Island general election, 1955|1955 election]].

MacMillan was named the province&amp;apos;s [[Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island|lieutenant governor]] on November 22, 1957 but died before being sworn in.
