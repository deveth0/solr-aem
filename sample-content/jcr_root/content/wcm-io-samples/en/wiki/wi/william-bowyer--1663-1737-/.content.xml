&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;William Bowyer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; the elder (1663 – 27 December 1737), [[England|English]] [[printer (publisher)|printer]], was apprenticed to a Miles Flesher in 1679, made a liveryman of [[The Stationers&amp;apos; and Newspaper Makers&amp;apos; Company]] in 1700, and nominated as one of the twenty printers allowed by the [[Star Chamber]].

Bowyer originally settled in White Friars, where he remained until January 1712/3, when his printing-house and warehouse were destroyed by fire. Bowyer began printing again on his own in October 1713 in Temple Lane. By 1716, thanks to the grant of a royal warrant for a charitable collection, and the generous support of the London trade, Bowyer was well on his way to economic recovery. [[William Bowyer (printer)|William Bowyer]], the son, born in 1699, entered the business as a corrector in June 1722. Father and son worked side-by-side until the former’s death in December 1737 and their publishing house was considered the most learned of its time.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Bowyer Ledgers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ed. Keith Maslen and John Lancaster (London: The Bibliographical Society, 1991), xxvi.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Although they published such important, learned works as [[Sir Isaac Newton]]&amp;apos;s [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]], they also published political pamphlets and advertising bills.

The four Bowyer ledgers, kept by father and son, are one of but four printing houses out of the seventy-four master printers in London in 1724, for which records are extant and offer the earliest example by over 20 years.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bowyer Ledgers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, xxiii.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

A main source for the lives of both father and son is John Nichols&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Literary anecdotes of the eighteenth century&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
