&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wisley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small village in [[Surrey]], England. It lies between [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham]] and [[Woking]]. It is the home of the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]&amp;apos;s [[Wisley Garden]]. The [[River Wey]] runs through the village.

Wisley gives its name to the nearby road intersection of the [[A3 road (Great Britain)|A3]] London to Portsmouth trunk road and the London Orbital [[M25 motorway]], Junction 10.

Wisley appears in [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wiselei&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It was held by Osuuold (Oswold). Its domesday assets were: 1½ [[hide (unit)|hide]]s; one church, one [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] worth 10 [[£sd|shillings]], three [[plough]]s, one [[fishery]] worth 5[[£sd|d]], {{convert|6|acre|m2}} of [[meadow]], [[woodland]] worth six [[hog (swine)|hog]]s. It rendered £3.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm Surrey Domesday Book]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Wisley Church was built in 1150.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.surreyplacesofworship.org.uk/visitors-detail.asp?ID=212 Wisley Church]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; There is a medieval church track running from [[Byfleet]] through Wisley to St Nicholas&amp;apos; Church, [[Pyrford]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.leyhunt.fsnet.co.uk/lhunt84.htm Church tracks]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Amenities==
Wisley Golf Club is located in the village, and has celebrity members including Colin Montgomery and [[Jamie Redknapp]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The former [[Wisley Airfield]], is located in the parish of [[Ockham, Surrey|Ockham]], situated next to the junction of the M25/A3&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;t=k&amp;amp;ll=51.30717,-0.46207&amp;amp;spn=0.012046,0.02635&amp;amp;t=k Google Maps &amp;amp;#150; Location of Wisley Airfield]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and had a 6,691 foot (1.27 mile) runway. Built towards the end of World War 2 as a flight test airfield for the [[Vickers]] aircraft factory at nearby [[Brooklands]], it opened in 1944 and after extended use for the development of military aircraft during the Cold War, it finally closed in 1972. Although the runway, taxiways and large areas of hardstanding survive, most of the buildings—including the unique control tower converted from an old timber-framed cottage—were demolished around 1980. The Ockham Beacon at the East end of the airfield still serves as a navigation aid for aircraft flying over the area today.
