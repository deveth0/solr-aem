* + an attempt to drive up traffic at his website.  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;delete&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. --[[User:Bodnotbod|bodnotbod]] 15:13, May 9, 2004 (UTC)
*Not vanity.  Keep. [[User:Anthony DiPierro|anthony]] [[User:Anthony_DiPierro/warning|(see warning)]] 15:54, 9 May 2004 (UTC)
*Comment: He gets a fair number of Google hits that aren&amp;apos;t from his own web site. Are we sure this is vanity? A CEO of a notable company deserves an article. [[User:Everyking|Everyking]] 17:50, 9 May 2004 (UTC)
*Delete. I tried googling for his company &amp;quot;Anandas Consulting&amp;quot;. It&amp;apos;s an &amp;quot;e-business consulting firm in Toronto&amp;quot;, only 95 google hits and it is not clear if the company still exists (its website does not exist). In one sentence, it is not a notable company. So, I vote delete. [[User:Andris|Andris]] 21:03, May 9, 2004 (UTC)
