        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is an archive of the discussion surrounding the proposed deletion of the page entitled [[Immortality Institute]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This page is kept as an historic record.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The result of the debate was to delete the article.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Delete. This is a very small organisation that happens to have 80 members (see [[Bruce Klein]], its founder, right above) and can afford a web page. There must be lots of similar groups around, and this one is not more encyclopedic than any others. This material can be moved to [[cryonics]] or other pages which deal with subjects related to ImmInst&amp;apos;s ideology and methodology.

* Delete.  This is too much of a vanity article to be moved to cryonics. [[User:AlainV|AlainV]] 21:21, 2004 May 16 (UTC)
* It&amp;apos;s an ad. Delete. -- [[User:Cyrius|Cyrius]]|[[User talk:Cyrius|&amp;amp;#9998]] 22:21, May 16, 2004 (UTC)
*Delete: advert, nonnotable. [[User:Wile E. Heresiarch|Wile E. Heresiarch]] 13:48, 17 May 2004 (UTC)
*keep: It&amp;apos;s a unique site, there are no other sites which target is the same. It contains a lot of information related to healthy life extension, which can&amp;apos;t be found in no other single place.
