&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Consumer Phone Services LLC&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[doing business as]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;QLT Consumer Lease Services&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, formerly &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AT&amp;amp;T Consumer Lease Services&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, has New Jersey-based operations managed by [[Alcatel-Lucent]], formerly [[Lucent Technologies (old company)|Lucent Technologies]]. The [[AT&amp;amp;T]] name was used under license since Lucent was spun off from AT&amp;amp;T on September 30, 1996.

Consumer Phone Services bought Lucent&amp;apos;s telephone leasing business in 2000, when Lucent reorganized its equipment businesses.

CPS leases out the following models made by [[Western Electric]]:
* [[Model 500 telephone|Traditional 500/554 Rotary Phone]]
* [[Model 500 telephone|Traditional 2500/2554 Touch-Tone Telephone]]
* [[Trimline telephone|Trimline 220/222 Rotary phone]]

CPS also leases the following models released post-breakup, manufactured by [[AT&amp;amp;T Technologies]], [[Lucent Technologies]], or [[Advanced American Telephones]]:
* [[Model 500 telephone|Desk Model/Wall Model]]
* [[Trimline|Signature Trimline]]
* [[Princess telephone|Signature Princess]]

Consumer Phone Services also leases cordless phones &amp;amp; telephone accessories.

Customers of Consumer Phone Services number less than a million. A majority of the customers are elderly who have found convenience in simply leasing the same telephone.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.wtopnews.com/index.php?nid=428&amp;amp;sid=605170 $3,000 for a Phone?&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Most customers are also leftovers from before the 1984 breakup of [[AT&amp;amp;T]], who did not opt to purchase their telephones before the buyout option expired in 1987. Such customers have paid for their telephones 10 times over or more prompting critics to call the service overpriced. But customers do retain the benefit of free replacement if the phone ever breaks and free accessories such as long cords.

== Name Change ==
On October 1, 2008, AT&amp;amp;T Consumer Lease Services changed its name to QLT Consumer Lease Services.
