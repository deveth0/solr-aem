&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oligoclase&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a rock-forming [[mineral]] belonging to the [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]]s. In chemical composition and in its crystallographic and physical characters it is intermediate between [[albite]] ([[sodium|Na]][[aluminum|Al]][[silicon|Si]]&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;[[oxygen|O]]&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;8&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;) and [[anorthite]] ([[calcium|Ca]]Al&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;Si&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;8&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;). The albite:anorthite molar ratio ranges from 90:10 to 70:30.

Oligoclase is a high sodium feldspar crystallizing in the [[triclinic]] system. The [[Mohs hardness]] is 6 to 6.5 and the [[specific gravity]] is 2.64 to 2.66. The [[refractive index|refractive indices]] are: nα=1.533–1.543, nβ=1.537–1.548, and nγ=1.542–1.552. In color it is usually white, with shades of grey, green, or red.

==Name and discovery==
The name oligoclase was given by [[August Breithaupt]] in 1826 from the Greek &amp;apos;&amp;apos;oligos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, little, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;clasein&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, to break, because the mineral was thought to have a less perfect cleavage than albite. It had previously been recognized as a distinct species by [[J. J. Berzelius]] in 1824, and was named by him soda-spodumene (Natron-spodumen), because of its resemblance in appearance to [[spodumene]].

==Occurrence==
Perfectly colorless and transparent glassy material found at [[Bakersville, North Carolina]] has occasionally been faceted as a [[gemstone]]. Another variety more frequently used as a gemstone is the [[aventurine]]-feldspar or sun-stone found as reddish cleavage masses in [[gneiss]] at [[Tvedestrand]] in southern [[Norway]]; this presents a brilliant red to golden metallic glitter, due to the presence of numerous small scales of [[hematite]] oriented within the feldspar structure.

Oligoclase occurs, often accompanying [[orthoclase]], as a constituent of plutonic [[igneous rock]]s such as [[granite]], [[syenite]], and [[diorite]]. It occurs in [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] and [[diabase]] [[dike (geology)|dikes]] and [[sill (geology)|sills]] as well as in the [[volcanic]] rocks  [[andesite]] and [[trachyte]]. It also occurs in gneiss. The best developed and largest crystals are those found with orthoclase, [[quartz]], [[epidote]], and [[calcite]] in veins in granite at [[Arendal]] in Norway. The distinctive texture of [[rapakivi granite]] is due to oligoclase rims on orthoclase [[phenocryst]]s. Oligoclase is also found in [[metamorphic rocks]] formed under transitional [[greenschist]] to [[amphibolite]] facies conditions.

==Schiller iridescence==
Some examples show Schiller iridescence due to the presence of [[exsolution]] lamellae on cooling in the peristerite miscibility gap, ~An&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;5&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;-An&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;18&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;.
