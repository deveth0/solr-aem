[[File:OlofRudbeckYounger.jpg|thumb|Olof Rudbeck the Younger (1660–1740). Oil-painted portrait in Uppsala University&amp;apos;s Universitethuset]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Olaus Rudbeckius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, junior or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Olof Rudbeck (d.y.)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1660–1740), [[Sweden|Swedish]] explorer and scientist, son of [[Olaus Rudbeckius|Olaus Rudbeck Sr]], Rudbeck Jr. succeeded his father as professor of medicine at [[Uppsala University]]. Young Rudbeck was an able [[botanist]] and [[ornithologist]] who took his doctor&amp;apos;s degree in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] in 1690. He traveled to [[Lapland, Sweden|Lapland]] in 1695, joining an expedition commissioned by the King, for which his mission was to study nature, the mountains in particular. He returned with an album of beautifully colored pictures of birds, flowers and scenery, for which he is best remembered.

At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Rudbeck Jr. turned his attention away from nature studies to speculation about the relationship between [[Sami languages|Sami]] and [[Hebrew language]]s. To honor his accomplishments (and posthumously, those of his namesake father) he was [[Swedish nobility|ennobled]] in 1719 by Queen Ulrika Eleanora as a &amp;quot;naturalized nobleman&amp;quot; (noble family of Rudbeck, nr. 1637). His student, the botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778), named a genus of flowers &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Rudbeckia]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in honor of him and his father.

His sister, Wendela, married Peter Olai Nobelius, and from them descends the [[Nobel family]], including [[Ludvig Nobel]], founder of [[Nobelbra]] and [[Alfred Nobel]], founder of the [[Nobel Prize]]s.
