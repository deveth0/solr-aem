&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Olaf Dreyer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1969 in Hamburg) is a German [[theoretical physicist]] and postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the [[University of Waterloo]] whose research interests include [[quantum gravity]] and the [[quantum measurement problem]].  Dreyer received his Ph.D. in quantum gravity in 2001 from the [[Pennsylvania State University]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web
