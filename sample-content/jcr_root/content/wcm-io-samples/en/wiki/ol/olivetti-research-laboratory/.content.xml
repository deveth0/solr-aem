The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Olivetti Research Laboratory&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ORL) was a research institute in the field of computing and telecommunications founded in 1986 by [[Hermann Hauser]] and [[Andy Hopper]].

==History==
When [[Olivetti]] acquired [[Acorn Computers]] in 1985, Hauser, who was Acorn&amp;apos;s co-founder, became vice-president for research at [[Olivetti]] where he was in charge of laboratories in the [[United States|US]] and [[Europe]]. In 1986, Hauser co-founded the Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) in Cambridge, England, along with Professor [[Andy Hopper]]. Hopper became the laboratory&amp;apos;s Director.

In 1988, Hauser left Olivetti. In 1997 the lab became the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Olivetti &amp;amp; Oracle Research Lab&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In January 1999 it was acquired by [[AT&amp;amp;T Corporation]] and became &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AT&amp;amp;T Laboratories Cambridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

AT&amp;amp;T Laboratories Cambridge was for three years Europe&amp;apos;s leading communications engineering research laboratory. The laboratory was internationally recognised as a centre of excellence, undertaking advanced research into communications, multimedia and mobile technologies.

As a result of heavy losses, AT&amp;amp;T restructured its worldwide research efforts and the Cambridge labs closed on 24 April 2002.

==Notable achievements==

* Original development of [[RFB protocol|RFB]] (remote framebuffer) protocol and [[Virtual Network Computing|VNC]], the desktop sharing technology
* Development and maintenance of the free [[CORBA]] implementation for C++ and Python [http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/history.html omniORB]
* [http://web.media.mit.edu/~dmerrill/badge/Want92_ActiveBadge.pdf The Active Badge System] - tracking of people and objects
