The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Olde English District&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[region]] of [[South Carolina]] encompassing [[Chester County, South Carolina|Chester]], [[Chesterfield County, South Carolina|Chesterfield]], [[Fairfield County, South Carolina|Fairfield]], [[Kershaw County, South Carolina|Kershaw]], [[Lancaster County, South Carolina|Lancaster]], and [[York County, South Carolina|York]] [[county|counties]] as well as the cities and towns of [[Camden, South Carolina|Camden]], [[Chester, South Carolina|Chester]], [[Chesterfield, South Carolina|Chesterfield]], [[Clover, South Carolina|Clover]], [[Kershaw, South Carolina|Kershaw]], [[Lancaster, South Carolina|Lancaster]], [[Pageland, South Carolina|Pageland]], [[Rock Hill, South Carolina|Rock Hill]], [[Winnsboro, South Carolina|Winnsboro]], and [[York, South Carolina|York]]

The district is believed by certain writers not to be a historical one, but a [[tourism]] device. Hence the [[ye olde|anachronistic  spelling]] of &amp;apos;old&amp;apos; and the inaccurate use of the [[Union Flag]] as a logo, which would conventionally refer to [[United Kingdom|British]] rather than [[England|English]] things. It is considered to be named after the large number of English immigrants, such as the [[cassiques]] of the [[Johnson-Stanton]] family of York and in the 1770s the region was the site of several battles in the [[American War of Independence]].  This district also includes the area known as the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]].
