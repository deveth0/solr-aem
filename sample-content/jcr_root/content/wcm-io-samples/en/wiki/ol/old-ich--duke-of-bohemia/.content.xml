&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oldřich&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{circa|975}} – 11 November 1034) was the [[Duke of Bohemia]] from 1012 to 1033 and briefly in 1034. He was a son of [[Boleslaus II of Bohemia|Boleslaus II]] and brother of [[Boleslaus III of Bohemia|Boleslaus III]] and [[Jaromír of Bohemia|Jaromír]].

== Life ==
Oldřich deposed Jaromír on 12 April 1012 and recognised the suzerainty of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. According to legend, Oldřich married a woman known as [[Božena (Křesinova)|Božena]], daughter of Křesina, after discarding his first wife on the grounds that they were childless.

Oldřich and his son [[Bretislaus I of Bohemia|Bretislaus]] sought to win back [[Moravia]] from the [[Poland|Poles]] and in 1029 Bretislaus drove the Poles out of the eastern lands. Bretislaus&amp;apos; efforts in [[Slovakia]] against [[Hungary]] failed in 1030 due to the jealousy of the [[Emperor Conrad II]]. In the following year, Czech forces refused to take the field for the emperor.

In 1032, Oldřich was invited to the Diet of [[Merseburg]] and did not appear. His absence raised the ire of the emperor and Conrad, busy with events in [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], charged his son [[Henry VI, Duke of Bavaria]], with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. Oldřich was deposed and sent to [[Bavaria]]. He was replaced by Jaromír, but he in turn was captured, blinded, and deposed by Oldřich, who seized power again and drove out Jaromír&amp;apos;s son from Moravia. Oldřich died abruptly on 9 November 1034 and later examination of his skeleton reveal his skull to have suffered a fatal blow. Jaromír then renounced the throne in favour of Bretislaus.
