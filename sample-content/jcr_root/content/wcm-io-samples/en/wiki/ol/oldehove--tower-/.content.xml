&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Oldehove&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an unfinished church tower in the medieval centre of the Dutch city of [[Leeuwarden]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Stenvert, 2000&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It leans  more than the  [[tower of Pisa]] in Italy.

Oldehove is also the name of an artificial mound (&amp;quot;terp&amp;quot; in Dutch) on which in the late 9th century a (Catholic) church dedicated to [[Saint Vitus]] was built. Construction of the adjoining Late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] tower began in 1529, after the citizens of Leeuwarden demanded a tower taller than the one in the city of [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], the [[Martinitoren]]. In charge were Jacob van Aken (or Aaken) and, after his death, Cornelis Frederiksz.

During construction, the tower began to sag, which the builders tried to compensate for by inserting several &amp;quot;kinks&amp;quot;, but the project was stopped in 1532 (1533 according to another source). In 1595-1596, the then derelict church was demolished, but the tower remains. It consists mostly of brick, but the builders also used so-called [[Bentheim]] [[sandstone]]. It is listed as a [[Rijksmonument]], number 24331.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot; Kennisinfrastructuur Cultuurhistorie &amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kich.nl/kich2010/rapport.jsp?id_qualifier=ODB:Rijksmonumentnr&amp;amp;id=24331|title= kich.nl (Kennisinfrastructuur Cultuurhistorie)|accessdate=2010-08-26}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
