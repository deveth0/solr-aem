&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Olov Svebilius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  was [[Archbishop of Uppsala]], Sweden, 1681-1700. He was born in [[Kalmar Municipality|Ljungby]], close to [[Kalmar]] in Sweden, January 1, 1624 and died the 29 June 1700.

He studied at the [[University of Uppsala]] 1638, two years later he enrolled in the [[KÃ¶nigsberg University]], and thereafter moved back to Uppsala to finish his studies.

Together with two Swedish members of the nobility he undertook a travel through Europe in 1651-1656. On returning he was ordained priest and later vicar. In 1663 he was appointed vicar in his home town Ljungby where he was very comfortable.

He was appointed court chaplain in 1668 and gave the King [[Eucharist|communion]] in 1670. He was also entrusted with commissioning the new Bible translation and revising the Swedish book of hymns.

He published many works. The most notable is perhaps &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A simple explanation of [[Martin Luther]]&amp;apos;s little [[catechism]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a book that was read throughout the country.

He was the Speaker of the Clergy in the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Riksdag]] between 1682-1697. He is said to have been a person of great authority.
