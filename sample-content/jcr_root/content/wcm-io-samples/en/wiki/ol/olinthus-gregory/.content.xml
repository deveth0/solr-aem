&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Olinthus Gilbert Gregory&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (29 January 1774 &amp;amp;ndash; 2 February 1841&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11469|title=Alexander Gordon, ‘Gregory, Olinthus Gilbert (1774–1841)’, rev. Ben Marsden, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 (subscriber access only)|accessdate=2008-05-21}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) was an [[England|English]] [[mathematician]], author and editor.

He was born on 29 January 1774 at [[Yaxley, Cambridgeshire|Yaxley]] in [[Huntingdonshire]]. Having been educated by [[Richard Weston (botanist)|Richard Weston]], a [[Leicester]] [[botanist]], in 1793 he published a treatise, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lessons Astronomical and Philosophical&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Having settled at [[Cambridge]] in 1796, Gregory first acted as sub-editor on the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cambridge Intelligencer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and then opened a booksellers shop. In 1802 he obtained an appointment as mathematical master at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]] through the influence of [[Charles Hutton]], to whose notice he had been brought by a manuscript on the Use of the Sliding Rule; and when Hutton resigned in 1807 Gregory succeeded him in the professorship. Failing health obliged him to retire in 1838, and he died at [[Woolwich]] on 2 February 1841.

Gregory&amp;apos;s books included &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hints for the Use of Teachers of Elementary Mathematics&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1840, new edition 1853), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Mathematics for Practical Men&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1825), which was revised and enlarged by Henry Law in 1848, and again by J. R. Young in 1862. His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Letters on the Evidences of Christianity&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1815) have been several times reprinted, and an abridgment was published by the [[Religious Tract Society]] in 1853. He will probably be longest remembered for his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Biography of [[Robert Hall (minister)|Robert Hall]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which first appeared in the collected edition of Hall&amp;apos;s works, was published separately in 1833, and has since passed through several editions. The minor importance of his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Memoir of [[John Mason Good]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1828) is due to the narrower fame of the subject.

He was one of the founders of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]. In 1802 he was appointed editor of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gentlemen&amp;apos;s Diary&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and in 1818 editor of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lady&amp;apos;s Diary&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and superintendent of the almanacs of the Stationers Company. Gregory was a co-editor of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pantologia]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1813.

Gregory&amp;apos;s son was [[Charles Hutton Gregory]], who later became president of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]].
