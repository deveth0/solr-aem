        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Olf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[physical unit                 |unit]] used to measure the strength of a pollution source. It was introduced by [[Denmark|Danish]] professor [[P. Ole Fanger]]; the name &amp;quot;Olf&amp;quot; is derived from the [[Latin]] word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;olfactus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, meaning &amp;quot;smelled&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Fanger&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Fanger, O. P.: Introduction of the Olf and the Decipol Units to Quantify Air Pollution Perceived by Humans Indoors. In: Energy and Buildings. 12, 1988, 1-6&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

One Olf is the sensory pollution strength from a standard person defined as an average adult working in an office or similar non–industrial workplace, sedentary and in thermal comfort, with a hygienic standard equivalent of 0.7 [[bathing|baths]] per day and whose skin has a total area of 1.8 square metres. It was defined to quantify the strength of pollution sources which can be perceived by humans.

The perceived air quality is measured in [[Decipol]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Fanger&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
