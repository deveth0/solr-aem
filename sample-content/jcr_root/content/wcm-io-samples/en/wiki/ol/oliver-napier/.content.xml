&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sir Oliver Napier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (11 July 1935&amp;amp;nbsp;– 2 July 2011&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-14001215&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) was the first leader of the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]]. In 1974 he served as the first and only Legal Minister and head of the Office of Legal Reform in the [[Northern Ireland Executive (1974)|Northern Ireland power-sharing executive]] set up by the [[Sunningdale Agreement]].

==Early life==
Napier was educated at [[St. Malachy&amp;apos;s College]], [[Belfast]] and the [[Queen&amp;apos;s University of Belfast]] before starting work as a solicitor.

==Political career==
Napier joined the [[Ulster Liberal Party]], rising to become Vice President by 1969.  That year, he led a group of four party members who joined the [[New Ulster Movement]], accepting the post of joint Chairman of its political committee.  The Liberal Party promptly expelled him, but, working with [[Bob Cooper (politician)|Bob Cooper]], he used his position to establish a new political party, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, which sought to become a political force that could command support from across the divided communities of the province.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Thomas G. Mitchell, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Indispensable Traitors&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, pp.10-11; 34-35&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This aimed to offer an alternative to what Napier described as the sectarianism of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]].

He served as the party&amp;apos;s joint leader from 1970 until 1972, then as its sole leader from 1973 to 1984.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Thomas G. Mitchell, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Indispensable Traitors&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p.64&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Under his leadership Alliance participated in successive assemblies that sought to solve the debate on the province&amp;apos;s position, including the [[Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973]] in which Napier was a [[minister (government)|minister]] in the power-sharing Executive. In 1979 he came closer to winning a seat in the [[Westminster Parliament]] than any other Alliance candidate in history when he was less than a thousand votes behind [[Peter Robinson (politician)|Peter Robinson]]&amp;apos;s winning total in [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]] in a tight three-way marginal. When Napier stepped down as leader in 1984 he received many plaudits for his work. The following year he was knighted and in 1989 he stood down from [[Belfast City Council]], seemingly to retire.

However, in 1995 he returned to the political fray when he contested the [[North Down by-election, 1995|North Down by-election]] for the Alliance, standing again in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]].

In 1996 he was elected to the [[Northern Ireland Peace Forum]] for [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]].

Prior to his death Oliver Napier was the last prominent member of the Ulster Liberal Party.

==Public positions==
Napier served on the Board of Governors of the first integrated school in Northern Ireland, [[Lagan College]].
