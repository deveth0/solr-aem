&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Olodum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a cultural group based in the Afro Brazilian community of [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], the capital city of the state of [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]]. It was founded by percussionist, [[Neguinho do Samba]].&amp;lt;ref name=g1&amp;gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Morre Neguinho do Samba, fundador do Olodum |url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/PopArte/0,,MUL1363688-7084,00-MORRE+NEGUINHO+DO+SAMBA+FUNDADOR+DO+OLODUM.html |work=[[EFE]]|publisher=[[G1 (website)]] |date=2009-11-02 |accessdate=2009-11-28}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

One of many similar groups in the city (and elsewhere in Brazil), it offers cultural activities to young people, largely centered around music; it also offers [[theatre|theatrical]] productions and other activities. Founded in 1979, its stated aims are to combat [[racism]], to encourage [[self-esteem]] and pride among Afro Brazilians, and to fight for [[civil rights]] for all marginalized groups.

Olodum is widely credited with developing the music style known as [[samba reggae]] and for its active participation in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Brazilian Carnival|carnaval]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; each year. [[Neguinho do Samba]], the lead percussionist, created a mix of the traditional Brazilian [[samba]] beat with [[Merengue music|merengue]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], and [[reggae]] rhythms for the [[Carnival|Carnaval]] of 1986. This became known as [[samba reggae]]. This &amp;quot;[[Blocos|bloco]] afro&amp;quot; music is closely tied to its African roots, as seen through its percussion instruments, participatory dancing and unique rhythm.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://africanmusic.org/artists/olodum.html/ African Music Encyclopedia]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It also directly draws from many Caribbean cultures, like [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Behague, Gerard. &amp;quot;Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music (1985-95).&amp;quot; Latin American Music Review 27, no. 1&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Olodum&amp;apos;s performing band (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Banda&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) has released records in its own right and has been featured on recordings by Brazilian stars such as [[Simone Bittencourt de Oliveira|Simone]] and [[Daniela Mercury]].

Olodum performed on [[Paul Simon]]&amp;apos;s 1990 album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Rhythm of the Saints]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and at the subsequent concert in Central Park, New York City on August 15, 1991.

In 1995, Olodum appeared in one of the [[music video]]s for [[Michael Jackson]]&amp;apos;s single, &amp;quot;[[They Don&amp;apos;t Care About Us]].&amp;quot;  The music was changed slightly to fit Olodum&amp;apos;s style of drumming.

In 1996, Olodum appeared in Heavy Metal band [[Sepultura]]&amp;apos;s album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Roots (Sepultura album)|Roots]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Neguinho do Samba died of [[heart failure]] on October 31, 2009, at the age of 54.&amp;lt;ref name=g1/&amp;gt; Olodom&amp;apos;s singer and songwriter, [[Germano Meneghel]], died in June 2011.&amp;lt;ref name=telam&amp;gt; {{cite news|first=|last=|title=La misteriosa muerte del vocalista de Olodum
