&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Olaf Tree Feller&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Old Norse]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Óláfr trételgja&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Olof Trätälja&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Olav Tretelgja&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, all meaning &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Olaf Woodwhittler&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was the son of the Swedish king [[Ingjald]] Ill-ruler of the [[House of Yngling]] according to [[Ynglingatal]].

==Heimskringla==
His mother was [[Gauthildr Algautsdóttir|Gauthild]], a princess of [[West Götaland]], whose maternal grandfather was [[King of Nerike|Olof the Sharp-sighted]], the king of [[Nerike]].

His mother sent him to his foster-father Bove in [[West Götaland]], where he grew up with his foster-brother Saxe who was surnamed Flette.

When Olof heard of his father&amp;apos;s death, he assembled the men who were willing to follow him and went to his kinsmen in [[Nerike]], because after his father&amp;apos;s atrocities, the Swedes had grown hostile towards the [[Ynglings]].

When the Swedes learnt that Olof and his kin had sought refuge in Nerike, they were attacked and had to head west through deep and mountainous forests ([[Kilsbergen]]) to Lake [[Vänern]] and the estuary of [[Klarälven]] (where [[Karlstad]] is presently situated).
Here, they settled and cleared land. Soon they had created a whole province called [[Värmland]], where they could make good living.

When the Swedes learnt that Olof was clearing land, they were amused and called him the Tree-feller. Olof married a woman named Solveig who was a daughter of [[Halfdan Guldtand]] of [[Soleyar]]. Olof and Solveigh had two sons, [[Ingjald Olofsson]] and [[Halfdan Hvitbeinn]], who were brought up in [[Soleyar]] in the house of his mother&amp;apos;s uncle Sölve.

Because of king [[Ivar Vidfamne]] and his harsh rule many Swedes emigrated to [[Värmland]], and they became so numerous that the province could not sustain them. The land was afflicted by famine of which the Swedes accused the king. It was an old tradition in Sweden of holding the king responsible for the wealth of the land (see [[Domalde]]). The Swedes accused Olof of neglecting his sacrifices to the gods and believed that this was the cause of the famine.

The Swedish settlers thus rebelled against Olof, surrounded his house on the shores of lake [[Vänern]] and burnt him inside it. Thus he was sacrificed to [[Odin]], like his ancestor [[Domalde]].

==Ynglingatal and Historia Norwegiae==
However, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Historia Norvegiæ|Historia Norwegiae]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; says that Olof succeeded his father and ruled as the king of Sweden in peace until his death.

The lines of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ynglingatal]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; appear to say that he was a Swedish prince (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;svía jöfri&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), and that he was burnt inside his hall and disappeared from [[Gamla Uppsala]].

==Archaeology==
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://www.foteviken.se/historia/ynglinga/yng_start.htm Source]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
Along the lower parts of the river [[Byälven]] in [[Värmland]], there are three large [[tumulus|barrow]]s, which legend attributes to Olof Trätälja. Moreover, there are many [[hillfort]]s near this river and the northern shore of Lake [[Vänern]] testifying to a violent period. Archaeological excavations from one of the hillforts, Villkorsberget, show that it was burnt in a period corresponding to Olof (510–680).
