&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ollerton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a village in the [[Cheshire East|Borough of Cheshire East]] and the ceremonial county of [[Cheshire]], [[England]]. It is situated  approximately {{convert|2|mi|km}} south east of the town of [[Knutsford]], and has a population of 323.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/viewFullDataset.do?instanceSelection=03070&amp;amp;productId=779&amp;amp;$ph=60_61&amp;amp;datasetInstanceId=3070&amp;amp;startColumn=1&amp;amp;numberOfColumns=8&amp;amp;containerAreaId=790336 Office for National Statistics : &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Macclesfield&amp;apos;&amp;apos;] Retrieved 2009-12-01&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Local services are limited, and include a [[parish church|church]] which is within [[Marthall]], [[public house|pub]] and several postboxes. Other services such as the [[primary education|primary]] [[school]], [[post office]] and [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shop]] have closed down, due to many residents using services in Knutsford. Ollerton combined with the adjacent village of [[Marthall]], has a [[Parish councils in England|joint parish council]], elected every 3 years, though having very limited and symbolic powers. The villages share the new village hall in [[Marthall]], which was constructed in November 2009.

Ollerton is thought to have come from the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Owlerton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and is named in the [[Domesday Book]].
