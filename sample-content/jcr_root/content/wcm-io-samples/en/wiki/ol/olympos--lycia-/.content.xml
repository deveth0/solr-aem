&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Olympos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-el|Ὄλυμπος}}) was an ancient city in [[Lycia]]. It was situated in a river valley near the coast. Its ruins are located south of the modern town [[Çıralı]] in the [[Kumluca]] district of [[Antalya Province]], [[Turkey]].

==History==

The former city of Olympos was founded in the [[Hellenistic period]], presumably taking its name from nearby Mount Olympos ({{lang-tr|Tahtalı Dağı}}, Timber Mountain), one of over twenty mountains with the name Olympos in the Classical world.

From these mountains of the Solymi, according to [[Homer]], the god [[Poseidon]] looked out to sea and saw [[Odysseus]] sailing away from [[Calypso (mythology)#The_Odyssey|Calypso]]&amp;apos;s island, and called up a great storm that wrecked him on the shores of the island of [[Nausicaa]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Homer]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Odyssey]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Book V).&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The coins of the city of Olympos date back to the 2nd century BC. It was described by [[Cicero]] as an ancient city full of riches and works of art.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Cicero]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Against Verres]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; II, 1, 4.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The city became one of the six leading cities of the [[Lycia#Lycian_League|Lycian League]]. In the 1st century BC, Olympos was invaded and settled by [[Cilician]] pirates. This ended in 78&amp;amp;nbsp;BC, when the Roman commander [[Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus (consul 79&amp;amp;nbsp;BC)|Publius Servilius Isauricus]], accompanied by the young [[Julius Caesar]], took the city after a victory at sea, and added Olympos to the [[Roman Empire]]. The pirate Zenicetes set fire to his own house and perished.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Strabo]], XIV, p. 5, Loeb ed.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The emperor [[Hadrian]] visited the city after which it took the name of Hadrianopolis for a period, in his honour.

The chief deity of Olympos was [[Hephaestus]], god of fire and blacksmiths. Near Olympos, located in the neighbouring village of [[Çıralı]] and about 200&amp;amp;nbsp;metres above sea level, the [[eternal flame]]s called the [[Chimaera (geography)|Chimaera]] may be seen issuing from the ground. The fuel source for the flames is natural gas, largely [[methane]], seeping through cracks in the earth. The mythical [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimaera]] - or Chimera - was a  monster with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of a serpent, who roamed these woods and sprouted fire from her mouth.

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], [[Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Rhodes|Rhodians]] built two [[fortress]]es along the coast, but by the 15th century Olympos had been abandoned. Today the site attracts tourists, not only for the artifacts that can still be found (though fragmentary and widely scattered), but also for its scenic landscapes supporting wild grapevines, flowering oleander, bay trees, figs and pines.
