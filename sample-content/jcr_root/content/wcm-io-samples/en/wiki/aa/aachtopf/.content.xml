The {{Audio|Aachtopf.ogg|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aachtopf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}} is [[Germany]]&amp;apos;s biggest [[spring (hydrology)|natural spring]], producing an average of 8,500 litres per second. Production varies seasonally and in response to the weather, but the spring never runs dry. The Aachtopf is a [[karst spring]] which is located south of the western end of the [[Swabian Jura]], near the town [[Aach, Baden-Württemberg|Aach]].

The name Aachtopf is compounded from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aach&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (meaning water in [[Old High German]]); the name of the river created by the spring is in full the [[Radolfzeller Aach]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Topf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; can be translated as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;bowl&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and is commonly used for round, bowl-shaped springs. The Radolfzeller Aach flows southward into [[Lake Constance]], which empties into the [[Rhine]].

The spring marks the southern end of a cave system which transports water from the western end of the Swabian Jura. Most of the water is derived from the [[River Danube]] and is obtained where the latter river disappears underground at the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Donauversickerung&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Danube Sinkhole]]) near [[Immendingen]] and [[Fridingen]]. Strangely, the [[Danube]] flows eastwards into the [[Black Sea]], whereas the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rhine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; flows northwards to the [[North Sea]]. Therefore the water of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aach&amp;apos;&amp;apos; flows under the European continental divide. This is a relatively common feature of karst [[stream capture]]s.

The karst spring is connected to a huge cave, which runs northwards. The cave is completely water-filled and can only be explored by [[cave diver]]s. The first exploration was made by [[Jochen Hasenmayer]], a famous German cave diver. Unfortunately, a collapse blocks the cave after a few hundred metres. The cave may continue for several kilometres beyond the other
side of the blockage. A local caving club was formed to find this &amp;quot;lost cave segment&amp;quot; by digging a shaft behind the collapse. At present, a continuation of the cave has not been found.

The Aachtopf is a favourite weekend destination and very romantic. It is not possible to see the cave because it is underwater and cave diving is extremely dangerous.
