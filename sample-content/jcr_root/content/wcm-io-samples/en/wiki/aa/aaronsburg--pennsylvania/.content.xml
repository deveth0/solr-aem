==History==
{{refimprove|date=November 2009}}

Founded by Aaron Levy in 1786, and named for him,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|year=1905|pages=22|author=Gannett, Henry|url=http://books.google.com/books/pdf/The_Origin_of_Certain_Place_Names_in_the.pdf?id=BqwPAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;output=pdf}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The town&amp;apos;s orderly planned and aligned streets were designed that the town might one day be the county seat. This, however never occurred due to the lack of water. The current county seat is [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania|Bellefonte]].

Aaronsburg is home to two churches (Salem Lutheran and Reformed), three cemeteries, a library, historical museum, and a pottery shop.

In 1949 a pageant was held to celebrate Aaronsburg&amp;apos;s unique history and namesake. Aaron Levy, a Jewish merchant from Philadelphia, presented the town&amp;apos;s residents with a pewter communion set as a gift. This unusual gesture inspired many, and 50,000 people descended upon Aaronsburg to commemorate it. Attendees included [[Ralph Bunche]], [[Cornell Wilde]], and, later, [[Ronald Reagan]]. A short film and book were written about this event.

The [[Aaronsburg Historic District]] was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nris&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
