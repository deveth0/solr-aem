&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oud-Beijerland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{pronunciation|Nl-Oud-Beijerland.ogg}}) is a town and municipality in the western [[Netherlands]], in the province of [[South Holland]]. With a population of 23,797 in 2005, it is the most populated town on the [[Hoeksche Waard]] island, located on the [[Oude Maas]] and [[Spui River]]s.

The municipality of Oud-Beijerland also includes the communities [[Vuurbaken]] and [[Zinkweg]].

==History==
After the [[St. Elizabeth&amp;apos;s flood (1421)]], large parts of the islands Putten and Grote Waard were lost and became clay banks and salt marshes which would be inundated at high tide and be unsuitable for habitation. In subsequent centuries, portions of land would be reclaimed.

Oud-Beijerland was formed in 1559 as &amp;quot;Beijerland&amp;quot; by [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont]]. He was granted the rights to this area in 1557 and had the land reclaimed. This new [[polder]] was named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Beijerland, Moerkerken, Cromstrijen en de Greup&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Circa 1624 the smaller polders Bosschenpolder and Nieuwlandpolder were added to it. Beijerland was named after Sabina of [[Bavaria]] (Dutch: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Beijeren&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), wife of the Count of Egmont.

In 1582 the name was changed to Oud-Beijerland, in order to distinguish it from [[Nieuw-Beijerland]] which was formed several kilometers to the west.

In 1604 the village got its churchtower from Sabina van Beijeren, and in 1622 the town hall was built. Oud-Beijerland then became one of the most important market places of the Hoeksche Waard. Its economy was dependent on trade, industry, agriculture and fishing. This brought prosperity which is still reflected in the elegant mansions along the Vliet.

From the end of the 19th century until ca. 1955, a tram connected Oud-Beijerland with [[Rotterdam]]. The tram was nicknamed &amp;quot;Het Moordenaartje&amp;quot; (The Little Murderer) because of the high rate of casualties involved with its operation.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{nl}} [http://www.engelfriet.net/Alie/Hans/verseput3.htm De tramwegen en stoombootveren van de RTM rondom Rotterdam], Engelfriet.net&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{nl}} [http://www.rotterdam010.nl/407-Herinneringen/Herinnering-Rotterdam-RTM.htm Herinnering aan de RTM], Rotterdam010.nl&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
