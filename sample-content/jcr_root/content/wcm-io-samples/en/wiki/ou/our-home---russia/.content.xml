&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Our Home – Russia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Наш дом – Россия, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nash dom – Rossiya&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}), abbreviated as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;NDR&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was a [[Russia]]n [[political party]] between 1995 and early 2000.

Our Home – Russia was founded in 1995 by then Russian [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]]. It was a liberal, centrist political movement, founded for the purpose of rallying more technocratic-reformist (right-wing) government supporters. At the time of its founding, Chernomyrdin had the backing of Russian [[President of Russia|president]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] along with numerous large financial institutions such as [[Association of Russian Banks]], and major companies such as [[Gazprom]], of which he was formerly the chairman. The movement attracted the sympathies and interests of many prominent members of the ruling elite of Russia, and NDR was thus nicknamed &amp;quot;the party of power&amp;quot;. It was also known as the party of the [[Russian oligarchs|Oligarchs]], the position previously identified with another political party, [[Democratic Choice of Russia|Russia&amp;apos;s Choice]]. Two other parties were interested in cooperating with NDR after its foundation: parts of the [[Agrarian Party of Russia]] and [[Democratic Choice of Russia]].  Together their platform would promote &amp;quot;freedom, property, and legality&amp;quot;, and would favor such policies as reducing the state&amp;apos;s role in the economy, support for small businesses, privatization of agriculture, and military cutbacks. However, after Chernomyrdin&amp;apos;s candidacy for a second term as Prime Minister was rejected by the [[State Duma|Duma]], Our Home – Russia declined the other parties&amp;apos; bid for cooperation.

Although it was critical of [[First Chechen War|the war in Chechnya]], Viktor Chernomyrdin and NDR played a central role in supporting Yeltsin in his 1996 bid for re-election as President of the [[Russian Federation]]. &amp;quot;To sum up why Our Home – Russia is for Yeltsin, I can say only one thing--because we are for reforms, for the constitution of Russia, for peace in Chechnya, for a normal life in Russia,&amp;quot; Chernomyrdin told [[Itar-Tass]] news agency in 1996.

In the spring of 1998, Yeltsin removed Chernomyrdin as head of government and in 1999 Yeltsin&amp;apos;s administration backed a newly formed party, [[Unity Party of Russia|Unity]], instead of Our Home – Russia. As a result, Our Home – Russia, which had 55 seats in the Russian [[State Duma]] in 1995-1999, won only 8 seats in the December 1999 election.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;See [http://www.russiavotes.org/Duma_align9599.htm party Alignments in the Duma, 1995-July 2003]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It did not form a separate faction in the next Duma and merged with [[United Russia]] instead.
