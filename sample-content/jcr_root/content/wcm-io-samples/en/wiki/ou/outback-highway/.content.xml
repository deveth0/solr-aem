The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Outback Highway&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Outback Way&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a series of roads and dirt tracks linking [[Winton, Queensland]] and [[Laverton, Western Australia]]. At {{convert|2800|km|0|abbr=on}}, it crosses [[Central Australia]] (colloquially known as the [[Outback]]), passing through [[Queensland]], the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Western Australia]].

It has been proposed as a development to provide an inland route between southern Western Australia and northern Queensland as an alternative to the [[Highway 1 (Australia)|National Highway 1]] along either coast.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;BSD Consultants.(1998) Outback Highway feasibility study : final report / prepared for Main Roads Western Australia, Northern Territory Department of Transport and Works, and Main Roads Queensland ; prepared by BSD Consultants Pty. Ltd. Subiaco, WA  &amp;quot;March 1998&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Roads that make up the highway are:

*[[Great Central Road]]
*[[Gunbarrel Highway]]
*[[Lasseter Highway]]
*[[Stuart Highway]]
*[[Plenty Highway]]
*[[Donohue Highway]]
*[[Kennedy Development Road]]

Support for the project is strong amongst local government areas along the route and elsewhere.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;cboh&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-06-23/councils-back-outback-highway-push/2768626 |title=Councils back outback highway push |accessdate=25 August 2011 |date=23 June 2011 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Federal funding of A$70 million over 10 years would be required.
