&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oudenburg&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Latin]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aldenburgensis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[municipality]] located in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] province of [[West Flanders]]. The municipality comprises the city of Oudenburg itself and the towns of [[Ettelgem]], [[Roksem]] and [[Westkerke, Belgium|Westkerke]]. On January 1, 2006 Oudenburg had a total population of 8,929. The total area is 35.38 km² which gives a [[population density]] of 252 inhabitants per km².

There was a Roman Castellum on this location, built in the 4th century, whose outline is still visible in the city&amp;apos;s streetplan. Some of the stones of the former walls were later used in the construction of the abbey. The former abbey of St. Peter at Oudenburg, founded by [[Arnold of Soissons]], was destroyed during the [[French Revolution]].

==History==
*1070 AD: [[Arnold of Soissons]] founded the abbey of St. Peter in Oudenburg
*1087: Death of Arnold of Soissons (also known as Arnold of Oudenburg or Saint Arnold)
*1226: The City is represented on a Seal
*1843, February 2: The arms were granted
The arms show a castle with the arms of the medieval Lords of Oudenburg in the gate. The castle (Burcht) is a [[Canting arms|canting]] element. The castle already appeared on the oldest [[Seal (device)|seal]] of the city, dating from 1226. All later seals showed a castle, but the size and shape of the castle has changed considerably through the centuries. The small shield appeared for the first time in the 16th century.
