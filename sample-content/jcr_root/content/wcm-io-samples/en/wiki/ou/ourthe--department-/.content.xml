        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ourthe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the name of a [[département in France|département]] of the [[First French Empire]] in present day [[Germany]] and [[Belgium]], at the time written as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ourte&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by French officials. It was named after the river [[Ourthe]]. Its territory corresponds more or less with that of the present day Belgian province [[Liège (province)|Liège]] and a small adjacent region in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].

The département was formed when the [[Southern Netherlands]] and the left bank of the [[Rhine]] were occupied by the French around 1795. Before the occupation, its territory was divided among the [[bishopric of Liège]], the abbacy of [[Stavelot]]-[[Malmedy]], the duchies of [[duchy of Limburg|Limburg]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], and the [[county of Namur]].

Its capital was [[Liège (city)|Liège]]. It was subdivided into the following [[arrondissement]]s and [[canton (subnational entity)|cantons]]:
* [[Liège (city)|Liège]], cantons: [[Dalhem]], [[Fléron]], [[Glons]], [[Herve]], [[Grâce-Hollogne|Hollogne]], [[Liège (city)|Liège]], [[Louveigné]], [[Seraing]] and [[Waremme]].
* [[Huy]], cantons: [[Avennes]], [[Verlaine|Bodegnée]], [[Ferrières, Belgium|Ferrières]], [[Héron, Belgium|Héron]], [[Huy]], [[Landen]] and [[Nandrin]].
* [[Malmedy]], cantons: [[Aubel]], [[Eupen]], [[Dahlem, North Rhine-Westphalia|Kronenburg]], [[Limbourg]], [[Malmedy]], [[Sankt Vith]], [[Schleiden]], [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], [[Stavelot]], [[Verviers]] and [[Vielsalm]].

After [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] was defeated in 1814, most of the département became part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] as the province of [[Liège (province)|Liège]]. The easternmost part ([[Eupen]], [[Malmedy]], [[Sankt Vith]], [[Kronenburg]], [[Schleiden]]) became part of the [[Prussia]]n [[Rhine Province]], but part of this (Eupen, Malmedy, Sankt Vith) was taken back into Liège province after the [[first world war]], under the [[Treaty of Versailles]].
