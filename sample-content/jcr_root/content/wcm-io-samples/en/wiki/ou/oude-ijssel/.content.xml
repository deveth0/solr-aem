&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oude IJssel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), literally &amp;apos;&amp;apos;old IJssel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Issel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[German language|German]]) is a [[river]] in [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]] approximately 80 km long. It is a right tributary of the river [[IJssel]].
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oude IJssel&amp;apos;&amp;apos; means &amp;quot;Old IJssel&amp;quot; in Dutch; the Oude IJssel was the upper course of the IJssel until the connection with the [[Rhine]] was dug, possibly in the [[Roman era]].

Since that moment the Rhine became the largest contributor to the flow of the IJssel, although only a relatively small amount of the total Rhine flow made its way into the IJssel system. Various tributaries can sometimes add quite some water to the total flow of the river, for example the [[Berkel]] and the [[Schipbeek]]. The IJssel river is the only branch of the [[Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta|Rhine delta]] that consumes tributary rivers instead of giving birth to distributary rivers. The latter only happens at the very last part of the river, where the small [[IJssel Delta]] is created.

The Oude IJssel begins near [[Borken, North Rhine-Westphalia|Borken]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany. It flows southwest until it nearly reaches the Rhine near [[Wesel]], then it turns northwest. After [[Isselburg]] it crosses the border with the Netherlands and enters the province of [[Gelderland]]. It flows through [[Doetinchem]] and joins the IJssel in [[Doesburg]].
