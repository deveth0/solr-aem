The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;VDL SB200&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (previously known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;DAF SB200&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a light-weight 12m citybus produced from 2001 by [[VDL Bus International]] (formerly DAF Bus International). It replaced the [[DAF SB220|SB220]], the longest of the DAF bus chassis in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] before the renaming of DAF Bus International.

It is originally designed for use by [[Arriva]] (VDL dealer in the UK) in order to save fuel over heavy-weight citybuses which are designed for [[Continental Europe]] where buses carry large numbers of standing passengers, whereas in the UK they do not.{{Dubious|date=February 2011}}

The SB200 sells very well in VDL&amp;apos;s home market, the [[Netherlands]] mainly using [[VDL Berkhof]] type [[Berkhof Ambassador|Ambassador]] and Citea LLE bodywork. They are operated by all large transport companies in the Netherlands, [[Connexxion]] (including Hermes), [[Veolia Transport]] and Arriva. Arriva also uses SB200 with [[Wrightbus|Wright]] bodywork.

In the UK sales have been slow, not helped by the increased success that [[Volvo Buses|Volvo]] and [[Scania AB|Scania]] are having with heavy-weight citybuses. Apart from Arriva other notable users include Claribels in [[Birmingham]] (which took the first bus) and [[Fishwick Buses|Fishwick]] of [[Leyland, Lancashire|Leyland]]. Initially the SB200 built for the UK was only available with [[Wright Commander]] bodywork, but from 2006, it has been available with [[Plaxton Centro]] (the first of these examples went to Fishwick) or [[Wright Pulsar]] (successor of the Wright Commander) bodywork.
