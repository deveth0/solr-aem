&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aiun-ken Hugo Makibi Enomiya-Lassalle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 11 November 1898 in Gut Externbrock near [[Nieheim]], [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]]; died 7 July 1990 in [[Münster]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia|Westphalia]]) was a German [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest and one of the foremost teachers to embrace both Roman Catholic [[Christianity]] and [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]].

Enomiya-Lassalle joined the [[Society of Jesus]] on 25 April 1919. At the end of the usual Jesuit spiritual and academic training he was ordained [[Catholic priest|priest]] on 28 August 1927.

He travelled to Japan as a [[Catholic missionary|missionary]] in 1929 and became interested in that country&amp;apos;s [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practices.  In 1940, he became the vicar of [[Hiroshima]], and on 6 August 1945 he was critically wounded by the nuclear blast in that city. Shortly thereafter, he returned to Germany.

In September 1946, he had an audience with [[Pope]] [[Pius XII]], in which he revealed his plan to build in Hiroshima a [[cathedral]] dedicated to the idea of world peace. Designed by Japanese architect [[Togo Murano]], construction on the cathedral began in 1950 and on 6 August 1954, the [[Memorial Cathedral for World Peace]] （[[:ja:世界平和記念聖堂|ja]]）was dedicated [http://hiroshima.catholic.jp/~pcaph/cathedral/?page_id=2].

In 1956, Enomiya-Lassalle began studying Zen with [[Harada Daiun Sogaku]].  In 1958, he published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zen: A Way to Enlightenment&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but the [[Holy See]] ordered him not to continue publishing on the subject.

Following Harada&amp;apos;s death in 1961, Enomiya-Lassalle became an apprentice of one of Harada&amp;apos;s students, [[Yamada Koun]].  Yamada was enthusiastic about the possibilities of Zen as a Christian practice, believing that &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zen would become an important stream in the Catholic Church one day&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://terebess.hu/english/sharf.html Terebess Asia Online]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  With Enomiya-Lassalle&amp;apos;s active assistance, he attracted a number of Catholic priests and nuns as students.  In the late 1960s, Enomiya-Lasalle was certified as a teacher in Yamada&amp;apos;s [[Sanbo Kyodan]] sect and given the title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Rōshi|roshi]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Zen master]]), while professing his continued belief in Christianity.  After 1968, Enomiya-Lassalle spent much of his time in Europe leading Zen retreats and encouraging Zen practice among Christians.  Then around 1983 he began to draw heavily from [[Jean Gebser]],  [[Sri Aurobindo]] and [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] to point to a new cultural paradigm based on [[integral consciousness]].[http://www.jean-gebser-gesellschaft.ch/TransDok/Jean%20Gebser%20and%20Zen.pdf]

Lassalle published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Practice of Zen Meditation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (1987, [[HarperCollins|Thorsons]]).
