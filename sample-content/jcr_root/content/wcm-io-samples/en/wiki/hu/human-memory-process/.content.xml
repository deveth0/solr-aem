        text="&lt;p&gt;Numerous theoretical accounts of [[memory]] have differentiated memory for [[fact]]s and memory for [[wiktionary:context|context]].  Psychologist [[Endel Tulving]] (1972; 1983) further defined these two declarative memory conceptions of [[explicit memory]] (in which [[information]] is consciously registered and recalled) into [[semantic memory]] wherein general [[world knowledge]] not tied to specific events is stored and [[episodic memory]] involving the storage of context-specific information about personal experiences (i.e. [[time]], location, and [[surrounding]]s of [[personal knowledge]]). Conversely, [[implicit memory]] (non declarative) involves perhaps [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[image registration|registration]] (lack of [[awareness]] during encoding), yet definite [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[recollection]].  [[Skill]]s and [[habituation|habit]]s, [[Priming (psychology)|priming]], and classical conditioning all utilize [[implicit memory]].

An essential aspect of [[episodic memory]] includes date and time encoding in the subject&amp;apos;s past.  For such processing, the details surrounding the [[memory]] (where, when, and with whom the [[experience]] took place) must be preserved and are necessary for an [[episodic memory]] to form, otherwise the memory would be [[semantic]].  For instance, one may possess an [[episodic memory]] of [[John F. Kennedy]]&amp;apos;s assassination, including the fact that he was watching [[Walter Cronkite]] announce that Kennedy had been murdered.  However, if the contextual details of this event were lost, remaining would be a [[semantic memory]] that [[John F. Kennedy]] was assassinated.  The ability to [[Recall (memory)|recall]] episodic information concerning a memory has been termed [[source monitoring]], and is subject to [[distortion]] that may lead to [[source amnesia]].
