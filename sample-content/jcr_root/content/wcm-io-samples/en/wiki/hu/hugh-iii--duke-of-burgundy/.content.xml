&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hugh III of Burgundy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1142 – August 25, 1192) was [[duke of Burgundy]] between 1162 and 1192. Hugh was the eldest son of duke [[Odo II, Duke of Burgundy|Odo II]] and Marie of Champagne, daughter of [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne|Theobald]] and Mathilda of Carinthia.

The rule of Hugh III marked the ending of a period of relative peace in the duchy of Burgundy. Hugh was a belligerent man and soon was involved in conflicts against king [[Louis VII of France]] over their borders. When [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] succeeded Louis in 1180, Hugh seized the opportunity and forced several men to change alliance to Burgundy. Philip II was not happy with the loss of his vassals and invaded the duchy, besieging Châtillon. The town fell and with it, its garrison, commanded by Eudes, Hugh&amp;apos;s heir. A peace was negotiated and Hugh had to pay a high ransom for his son and give up ambitions over French territory.

Hugh then turned his energies to the Holy Land, embarking in the [[Third Crusade]] in the retinue of Philip II. He was the most trusted ally of [[Richard I of England|Richard, the Lionheart]] and fought with him against [[Saladin]]. When Philip returned to France, he left Hugh in charge of the French troops. Hugh played a major role in the victory of the [[battle of Arsuf]] (September 7, 1191) and the conquest of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], where he died in the following year.

In 1187, Hugh transferred the capital of Burgundy to [[Dijon]], and endeavoured to turn the city into a major commercial centre.
