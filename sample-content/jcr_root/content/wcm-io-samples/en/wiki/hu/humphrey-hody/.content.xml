[[File:Humphrey Hody.jpg|thumb|Humphrey Hody, line engraving by [[Michael Vandergucht]]]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Humphrey Hody&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1659&amp;amp;nbsp;– 20 January 1707) was an [[England|English]] scholar and [[theology|theologian]].

==Life==

He was born at [[Odcombe]] in [[Somerset]] in 1659.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Humphrey Hody (1659–1706)|url=http://words.fromoldbooks.org/Chalmers-Biography/h/hody-humphrey.html|publisher=Chalmers|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  In 1676 he entered [[Wadham College, Oxford]], of which he became a fellow in 1685. In 1692 he became chaplain to [[Edward Stillingfleet]], [[bishop of Worcester]], and for his support of the ruling party in a controversy with [[Henry Dodwell]] regarding the non-juring bishops he was appointed chaplain to Archbishop [[John Tillotson]], an office which he continued to hold under [[Thomas Tenison]].

In 1698 he was appointed regius professor of [[Greek language|Greek]] at Oxford, and in 1704 was made [[archdeacon]] of Oxford.

==Works==

In 1684 he published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Contra historiam Aristeae de LXX. interpretibus dissertatio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in which he argued that the so-called &amp;quot;letter of [[Aristeas]]&amp;quot;, containing an account of the production of the [[Septuagint]], was the late forgery of a [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] [[Jew]] originally circulated to lend authority to that version. The dissertation was generally regarded as conclusive, although [[Isaac Vossius]] published an angry and scurrilous reply to it in the appendix to his edition of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pomponius Mela]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book| last = Champion| first = J.A.I| title = The Pillars of Priestcraft Shaken: The Church of England and its Enemies, 1660-1730| url = http://books.google.com/?id=m5BOAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA50| year = 1992| publisher = Cambridge Studies in Early Modern British History| isbn = 978-0521405362| pages = 48-52 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1689 Hody wrote the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Prolegomena to the Greek chronicle of [[John Malalas]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, published at Oxford in 1691. In 1701 he published &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A History of English Councils and Convocations&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book| last = Hody| first = Humphrey| title = A History of English Concils and Convocations| url = http://books.google.com/?id=IopNpwAACAAJ| year = 2011| publisher = BiblioBazaar| isbn = 978-1-173-57826-8 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  and in 1703 in four volumes &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Bibliorum textis originalibus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book| last = Hody| first = Humphrey| title = De bibliorum textibus originalibus, versionibus graecis, et latina Vulgata| url = http://books.google.com/?id=BSlEAAAAcAAJ| year = 1705| publisher = Thef. Scheldoniano }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  in which he included a revision of his work on the Septuagint,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Humphrey Hody|url=http://gluedideas.com/content-collection/cyclopedia-of-biblical-literature/Humphrey-Hody.html|publisher=Glued Ideas|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  and published a reply to Vossius.

A work, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Graecis Illustribus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which he left in manuscript, was published in 1742 by [[Samuel Jebb]], who prefixed to it a Latin life of the author.
