The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Huon Valley Council&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of [[Tasmania]]. It is the southernmost local government area in [[Australia]].

It encompasses the town of [[Huonville, Tasmania|Huonville]], on the [[Huon River]], some surrounding towns, and many [[Protected areas of Tasmania (Australia)|protected areas]] and [[forestry]] plantations. The [[Tahune Airwalk]] is also in the area, located near the township of [[Geeveston, Tasmania|Geeveston]].

In 1993 the Municipalites of Esperance, Huon and Port Cygnet were amalgamated to form the Huon Valley Council. Remote subantarctic [[Macquarie Island]], which is located some 1400&amp;amp;nbsp;km southeast of Tasmania proper, was part of Esperance until then, and has been part of Huon Valley since then.

The municipality has seven townships:
#[[Cygnet, Tasmania|Cygnet]]
#[[Dover, Tasmania|Dover]] (on Esperance Bay)
#[[Franklin, Tasmania|Franklin]]
#[[Geeveston, Tasmania|Geeveston]]
#[[Port Huon, Tasmania|Port Huon]]
#[[Glen Huon, Tasmania|Glen Huon]]
#[[Huonville, Tasmania|Huonville]]

For election purposes, Huon Valley is un-subdivided. Councillors serve divided four year terms, with elections every two years using the [[Hare-Clark]] system of proportional representation. The terms of four Councillors expire at one two yearly election, and the terms of five Councillors expire at the other. The Mayor and Deputy Mayor are each directly elected for a two-year term. The Mayor and Deputy Mayor must also be elected Councillors. Unless a non-retiring Councillor they are ineligible to hold the position of Mayor or Deputy Mayor if they fail to win election to a Councillor position as well. The current composition of the Council, with place of residence, is:&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.huonvalley.tas.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=353&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

* Mayor for a term expiring 2013:  Robert Armstrong (Cygnet)

Neither the [[Australian Labor Party]] nor the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] endorse local government candidates in Tasmania. Most councillors are [[non-partisan]]. Two Councillors, Liz Smith and Rosalie Woodruff, are members of the [[Australian Greens]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.tasmaniantimes.com/index.php/article/huon-valley-guessing-games-12&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

According to ABS data, the townships in the South East that experienced the largest growth were Huonville (including Franklin where the population was up by 1,300 people)with Cygnet third (up for 440).
