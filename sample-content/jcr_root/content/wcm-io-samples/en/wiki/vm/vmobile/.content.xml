&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vmobile&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Nigeria]]n [[mobile phone]] network provider with close to a million subscribers in 2004. The company was previously owned by [[Econet Wireless Nigeria]], but after a shareholder dispute was purchased (for a month) by Vodacom of South Africa. The Vodacom deal was short lived, and the operator soon thereafter began trading a VMobile Nigeria, owned by Vee Netoworks Limited. The name Vee was based on Vee from Vodacom, after Vodacom pulled out of the deal. Vodacom&amp;apos;s South African staff was retained by the Nigerian Investors, to run the now called VMobile network. Willem Swart was appointed as CEO, with a number of previous Econet staff as directors.

The company claimed that all investors were Nigeria-based. They included the state governments of [[Lagos]], [[Delta State, Nigeria|Delta]] and [[Akwa Ibom State|Akwa Ibom]]. On April 16, 2006, [[Celtel]] made a conditional offer for Vmobile and in May 2006, Vmobile was bought over by Celtel for US$1.005. billion after Celtel acquired a controlling stake of 65% in Vmobile

During its time, Vmobile branded itself as the network for the Nigerian people, with the catch phrase being &amp;quot;its all about you&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_20052607.shtml |title=Celtel Sierra Leone buys Nigeriaâ€™s Vmobile |accessdate=2007-06-14 |author=Awareness Times |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2006-05-31|work= |publisher= |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
