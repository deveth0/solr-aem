==Works==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chinthayile Roopakangal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (1991) is a collection of articles on the role of metaphors in [[philosophy]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[literary theory]]. It includes two introductory essays on [[Jacques Derrida]].The last two essays discuss novels by [[O. V. Vijayan]] and [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pravachakante Maranam&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (1993) includes an early piece on the [[Absurdism|absurd]] (1972), an essay on Bertolt Brecht&amp;apos;s theatre, an introduction to Brecht&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Threepenny Novel]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a study of Ambikasuthan Mangad&amp;apos;s story and an essay on the politics of [[deconstruction]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kathayum Pratyayasastravum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,(1993) contains an introduction to Western [[Marxist]] literary criticism, and an introduction to [[structuralism]]. It includes an essay on the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dhvani]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; theory  which argues that Dhvani is the same as [[metaphor]] in the broad sense of the term, an essay on the ideological underpinnings of some short stories and essays on [[T. Padmanabhan]] and [[Paul Zacharia]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vaakkum Vaakkum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (1996) is devoted to the reading of poems by [[Vyloppillil Sreedhara Menon]], [[P. Kunhiraman Nair]], [[K. Ayyappa Panicker]] and [[Kadammanitta Ramakrishnan]]. The other works discussed include novels by [[O. V. Vijayan]], [[V. M. Basheer]] and short stories by [[T. Padmanabhan]] and [[Zacharia]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arthantaranyasam&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (1999) discusses the relevance of the classical Indian concepts of [[Dhvani]] and [[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]]. It begins with an analysis of the theory of [[metaphor]] and its relationship with the concepts of [[Freudian]] [[unconscious mind|Unconscious]] and [[Marxian]] concept of [[ideology]].It is argued that in their classical form Dhvani and Rasa are not useful in reading modern texts.Rasa is rejected as such, and the Dhvani  theory is given a more prosaic interpretation along the lines suggested by [[Mukulabhatta]]. Instead of reviving these theories, these are to be destroyed and a new concept can be created out of their ruins.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aadhunikotharam: Vimarsanavum Vikalanavum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (1999) is a closely argued response to some [[Malayalam]] critics and writers who maintain that [[Malayalam literature]] has already entered into its post-modern phase. With reference to the Western writers, it is argued that this claim is not true.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vimarsanatmaka siddhantam&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (1999) is an expository book on the work of [[Frankfurt School]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Novelvayanakal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (2003) reads 12 Malayalam novels without using many critical tool borrowed from the west. Part of the text itself is taken as the model for reading and interpreting it. It brings out relays of meanings across the works. It reveals a current of non-religious [[spirituality]] running through the works read.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Prathivadangal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (2004) is a thoroughgoing criticism of  Marxian philosophical concepts.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Arthavadangal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (2006: Mathrubhumi Books, Kozhikode)contains essays on Death, Dhvani theory. Arthavadam, M. P. Paul and William Hudson, Appan Thampuran&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bhutarayar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Venmani Mahan&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pooraprabandham&amp;apos;&amp;apos; etc.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rahukalam&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (2007: Sign Books, Thiruvananthapuram) is a collection of essays on Joseph Muliyil&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sukumari&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Medieval Malayalam poetry, Asan&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Duravastha&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, N. Prabhakaran&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bhutabhumi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, poetry of Rafeeq Ahmed and [[Cervantes]]&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Don Quixote]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
