        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Værløse&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a municipality ([[Danish language|Danish]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Municipalities of Denmark|kommune]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) consisting of only &amp;apos;&amp;apos;one&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[parish]] also named Værløse in the former [[Copenhagen (county)|Copenhagen County]] on the island of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sjælland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) in eastern [[Denmark]].  The municipality covered an area of 34 km², and in 2005 had a total population of 18,649.  Its last mayor was Jesper Bach, a member of the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] (Liberal Party) [[Politics of Denmark|political party]].
He will be the first mayor of the newly formed [[Furesø municipality]]. The community is connected by a road and a motorway and commuter railway to [[Farum]] to the north via an [[isthmus]] at Fiskebæk between Lake Farum sø and Lake [[Furesø (lake)|Furesø]]. The road and motorway run through a small forest on the western shore of Lake Furesø and is almost out of sight and hearing distance from nearby homes in Værløse, but north of the isthmus they run through the town of Farum, separating it in a western and eastern part.

The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of [[Værløse]].  Other towns in the former municipality are [[Hareskovby]], [[Kirke Værløse]], and [[Jonstrup]].

Neighboring municipalities were [[Farum municipality|Farum]] to the north, [[Stenløse]] to the west, [[Ballerup]] and [[Herlev]] to the south, and [[Gladsaxe]], [[Lyngby-Taarbæk]] and [[Søllerød]] to the east, albeit the last of these is separated physically from the municipality by the waters of Lake &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Furesø (lake)|Furesø]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

On January 1, 2007 Værløse municipality ceased to exist, as the result of [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipal Reform 2007|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kommunalreformen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;The Municipal Reform&amp;quot; of 2007)]].  It merged with [[Farum municipality]] to form the new [[Furesø municipality]].  This created a municipality with an area of 57 km² and a total population of 37,311 (2005).  The new municipality belongs to [[Region Hovedstaden]] (&amp;quot;Copenhagen Capital Region&amp;quot;).

Værløse is mentioned in the weather report but sounds almost like &amp;quot;vejrløse&amp;quot;, which means &amp;quot;weatherless&amp;quot;. This is a well known joke.
