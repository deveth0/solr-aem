        text="&lt;p&gt;The spectra of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;V-type asteroids&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;vestoids&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, are similar to that of [[4 Vesta]], by far the largest asteroid in this class (hence the name). Approximately 6% of main-belt asteroids are vestoids.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

A large proportion have orbital elements similar to those of 4 Vesta, either close enough to be part of the [[Vesta family]], or having similar [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricities]] and [[inclination]]s but with a [[semi-major axis]] lying between about 2.18 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] and the 3:1 [[Kirkwood gap]] at 2.50 AU. This suggests that most or all of them originated as fragments of Vesta&amp;apos;s crust, possibly blasted out by a single very large impact at some point in its history. The enormous southern-hemisphere crater on Vesta is the prime candidate for the impact site.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Bus02&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal | author= S. J. Bus and R. P. Binzel| title= Phase II of the Small Main-belt Asteroid Spectroscopy Survey: A feature-based taxonomy| journal= Icarus| year= 2002| volume= 158| pages= 146| doi= 10.1006/icar.2002.6856| bibcode=2002Icar..158..146B}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The V-type asteroids are moderately bright, and rather similar to the more common [[S-type asteroid|S-type]], which are also made up of [[Rock (geology)|stony]] [[iron]]s and ordinary [[chondrite]]s. This rather rare type of asteroid contains more [[pyroxene]] than the [[S-type asteroid|S-type]].

The [[electromagnetic spectrum]] has a very strong absorption feature longward of 0.75 [[μm]], another feature around 1 μm and is very red shortwards of 0.7&amp;amp;nbsp;µm. The visible wavelength spectrum of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;V-type&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; asteroids (including 4 Vesta itself) is similar to the spectra of basaltic achondrite [[HED meteorite]]s.

A [[J-type asteroids|J-type]] has been suggested for asteroids having a particularly strong 1 μm absorption band similar to [[diogenite]] meteorites,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Binzel93&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal | author= R. P. Binzel and S. Xu| title= Chips off of asteroid 4 Vesta: Evidence for the parent body of basaltic achondrite meteorites| journal= Science| year= 1993| volume= 260| pages= 186 | doi= 10.1126/science.260.5105.186| pmid= 17807177 | issue= 5105|bibcode = 1993Sci...260..186B }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; likely being derived from deeper parts of the crust of 4 Vesta.

== Distribution ==
The vast majority of V-type asteroids  are members of the Vesta family along with Vesta itself. There are some [[Mars-crosser asteroid|Mars-crossers]] such as [[9969 Braille]], and some [[Near-Earth objects]] like [[3908 Nyx]].

There is also a scattered group of objects in the general vicinity of the Vesta family but not part of it. These include:&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal | author= V.
