&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;V Recordings&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[drum and bass]] [[record label]], based in [[London]]. Started by [[DJs]] [[Bryan Gee]] and [[Jumping Jack Frost]], V Recordings is one of the longest-running Drum and Bass imprints,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;IMO Records [http://www.imorecords.co.uk/drumandbasslabels/v-recordings-biography/ &amp;quot;V Recordings Biography&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[IMO Records]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Retrieved on 12 December 2011.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; with a large catalogue of releases stretching back to [[1993 in music|1993]].  V Recordings has consistently featured some of the biggest names in Drum and Bass, with releases by [[Roni Size]], [[DJ Die]], [[DJ Krust]], [[Ed Rush]] and [[Optical (artist)|Optical]] and [[Dillinja]]. Bryan Gee continues to own and operate the label.

V Recordings is known for representing a wide variety of styles and subgenres of Drum and Bass, from the liquid styles of [[Artificial Intelligence]] to the harder sounds of [[Dillinja]] and [[Lemon D]].  V Recordings was also the first UK label to feature the material from the Brazilian Drum and Bass scene. Following a trip to the South American country, label boss Bryan Gee was amazed at both the huge popularity of Drum and Bass in Brazil and at the skills of local DJs, including [[DJ Marky]], [[Patife]], [[XRS Land]] and [[Esom]].  The result of this connection was the popular &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Brazil EP&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2001) and the chart hit &amp;apos;&amp;apos;LK&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2002), a remix of the Brazilian classic &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Carolina Carol Bela&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  Following this initial exposure, Brazilian DJs and producers have become a fixture of the UK Drum and Bass scene.

V Recordings has reased two compilation albums; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;V Classic (VELP 01)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1997 and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Planet V (VELP 02)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1999 and a number of mix CDs.
