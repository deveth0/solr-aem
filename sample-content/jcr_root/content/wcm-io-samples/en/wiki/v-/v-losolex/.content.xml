&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;VéloSoleX&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[moped]], or [[motorised bicycle]], which was originally produced by the French manufacturer [[Solex]], based in [[Paris]], France. The company manufactured [[centrifugal radiator]]s, [[carburetor]]s, and [[micrometer]]s, before branching into assist motors and [[bicycle]]s. Owned successively by [[Dassault]], [[Renault]], [[Motobécane]]/[[MBK (Scooter manufacturer)|MBK]], VéloSoleX sold more than 7 million units worldwide before ceasing production in France in 1988. Production of the VéloSoleX restarted in both China and Hungary after 1988, but production ceased in Hungary in 2002. VéloSoleX is now manufactured in France.
