&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Personal Matter&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos; (個人的な体験, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kojinteki na taiken&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a novel by Japanese writer [[Kenzaburō Ōe]].  Written in 1964, the novel is dark, deeply personal, and semi-autobiographical.  It tells the story of Bird, a man who must come to terms with the birth of his mentally disabled son.

==Plot==

Bird&amp;apos;s son, like Ōe&amp;apos;s, was born with a [[brain herniation|brain hernia]], however at the end of the novel this is revealed to be a false diagnosis of a benign tumor. Bird tries to escape his responsibility for the child and his crumbling relationship with his wife &amp;amp;ndash; turning to alcohol and an old girlfriend. Bird is fired from his job teaching at a cram school in the process.  He half attempts to kill the child, albeit indirectly, and is forced to make a decision as to whether or not he wants to keep the child.

==Themes==

Though the novel has a &amp;quot;happy&amp;quot; end, it should be considered in juxtaposition with the story &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Aghwee the Sky Monster]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also by Ōe), in  which a father faced with a similar decision makes a different choice. Ōe&amp;apos;s son, [[Hikari Ōe]], despite his disability has made something of a name for himself in Japan through musical composition.
