&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Gamut of Games&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, written by [[Sid Sackson]] and first published in 1969, contains rules for a large number of [[paper and pencil game|paper and pencil]], [[card game|card]], and [[board games|board]] [[game]]s. Many of the games in the book had never before been published.  It is considered by many to be an essential text for anyone interested in [[abstract strategy]] games, and a number of the rules were later expanded into full-fledged published board games.

Some of the games which were later sold separately include [[Focus (board game)|Focus]], [[Property (game)|Property]] and Origins of World War I; [[Robert Abbott (game designer)|Robert Abbott]] expanded his game [[Crossings (game)|Crossings]], published here, into the more-refined title [[Epaminondas (game)|Epaminondas]].  Many of the games covered in the book were creations of Sid Sackson himself, who was a prolific game designer.
