==Historical mistakes in the book==
The book is mostly historically correct about the facts they point out, but there are a few mistakes in the book. These are some of them:

*When the author speaks of a dream where everything in boxing would be ideal, he states &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marcel Cerdan wouldn&amp;apos;t bear any of the scars of that horrific plane crash&amp;apos;&amp;apos;- Cerdan died in the plane crash.

*The Julio César Chávez section says Chávez beat [[Edwin Rosario]] by knockout in ten rounds. Chávez actually took eleven rounds to win.
*The Roberto Durán section says Duran beat [[Iran Barkley]] with a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;brilliant knockout&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Duran won that fight by decision.
*The Wilfredo Gómez section says Gómez beat [[Lupe Pintor]] by knockout in twelve rounds. Gómez actually took fourteen rounds to win.
*The Salvador Sánchez section says that he dropped Gómez three times during their fight. He actually dropped Gómez twice. It also says that Sanchez died five months after his fight with Azumah Nelson, when in reality, Sanchez only died a month and a half after it.
*The caption below Alexis Argüello&amp;apos;s photo identifies him as a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Versatile [[Argentina|Argentine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Arguello was actually from [[Nicaragua]].
