        text="&lt;p&gt;[[Image:Armoiries Arménie-Lusignan.svg|thumb|150px|Constantine&amp;apos;s arms, a combination of those of Lusignan, Jerusalem, and Cilicia.]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Constantine II&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Constantine IV&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; {{lang-hy|Կոստանդին Բ}}, [[Western Armenian]] [[transliteration]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gosdantin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kostantine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; died 17 April 1344), born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Guy de Lusignan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was elected the first Latin [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|King of Armenian Cilicia]] of the [[Lusignan]] dynasty, ruling from 1342 until his death in 1344.

He was a son of [[Princess Isabella of Armenia|Isabella]], daughter of [[Leo II of Armenia]], and [[Amalric of Tyre|Amalric]], a son of [[Hugh III of Cyprus]], and was made [[Governor]] of [[Serres]] in 1328 and until 1341. When his cousin [[Levon IV of Armenia|Leo IV]], the last [[Hethumid]] monarch of Cilicia, was murdered by the barons, the crown was offered to his younger brother [[John of Lusignan|John]], who urged Guy to accept it. Guy was reluctant — his mother and two of his brothers had been murdered by the Armenian regent [[Oshin of Corycos]] — but he eventually accepted and took the name Constantine.

Guy was killed or murdered in an uprising in [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenia]] on April 17, 1344 and was succeeded by a distant cousin, [[Constantine V of Armenia|Constantine III]]. He had married twice, firstly in [[Constantinople]] ca 1318 or 1318 to a Kantakouzene (died ca 1330), without issue, and secondly in 1330–1332, Theodora Syrgiannaina (died 1347/1349), sister of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[pinkernes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;cupbearer&amp;quot;) [[Syrgiannes Palaiologos|Syrgiannes Palaiologos Philanthropenos]], with whom he fathered two children. One of them, Isabella (or Zampea=Maria) de Lusignan (ca or after 1333 – in [[Cyprus]], 1382–1387), Lady of [[Aradippou]], married after February 26, 1349 [[Manuel Kantakouzenos]] (ca 1326 – April 10, 1380), [[Despot of Morea]].
