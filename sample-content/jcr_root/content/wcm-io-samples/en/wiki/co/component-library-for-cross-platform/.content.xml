&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Component Library for Cross Platform (CLX)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (pronounced clicks), is a cross-platform visual component-based framework for developing [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]] applications. It is developed by [[Borland]] for use in its [[Kylix programming tool|Kylix]], [[Delphi programming language|Delphi]], and [[C++ Builder]] software development environment.

Its aim was to replace the popular [[Microsoft Foundation Classes]] with [[Visual Component Library]]. CLX was based on [[Qt (framework)|Qt]] by [[Nokia]]. The [[Application programming interface|API]] of CLX almost completely followed VCL. It was envisioned that existing applications using VCL would be recompiled with CLX.

However, due to lacklustre performance on Windows, subtle differences from VCL, and bugs, it didn&amp;apos;t become the expected successor to VCL. Commercial failure of Kylix stopped further development of CLX.

In terms of [[object-oriented]] approach, CLX forms an object hierarchy where the TObject class serves as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Superclass (computer science)|base class]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. All other classes inherit or indirectly inherit the TObject class.
