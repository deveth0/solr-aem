        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Constant Chevillon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born October 26, 1880 in [[Annoire]] ([[Jura (department)|Jura]]); died March 23, 1944 in Lyon) was Grand Master of the [[Freemasonry]] [[Rite of Memphis-Misraïm]] and head of [[FUDOFSI]] and other [[occult]] societies.

As a member of the Rosicrucian Fraternity, he was opposed to [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]]&amp;apos; [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis|AMORC]] and [[FUDOSI]].

He was enthroned as [[Patriarch]] of the [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica#History|Eglise Gnostique Universelle]] after [[Jean Bricaud]], and succeeded by one of his students, René Chambellant, who maintained the compendium of esoteric societies in cooperation with the [[Gnostic church]].

At an early age, his prodigious memory and learning genius made their debut and the priest decided to teach him Latin. At the age of twelve, he entered the College of Montciel, near Lone-le Saulnier (Jura). He studied [[Literature]], [[Ancient History]], the [[Classics]] and [[Philosophy]].

He moved on to higher branches of learning, receiving a Bachelor&amp;apos;s degree at the Faculty of Letters at Lyon where he also received his [[Licentiate]]&amp;apos;s Degree and a Fellowship.

He studied philosophy under the celebrated Professor Arthur Hennequin. He knew [[Socrates]]&amp;apos; [[Precept]]s of [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]], but the one that guided his life was: &amp;quot;Renounce thyself while serving others&amp;quot;. His philosophy professor was such an ideal for him that after Hennequin&amp;apos;s death, he left the University.

He went to work at the Société Général, a bank in Lyon and worked there until 1913. Later he went to work for the Banque Nationale de Credit in Lyon and continued his work there until his death.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[R. Swinburne Clymer]], M. D. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Book of Rosicruciae&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, v. ii pp. 96-99, The Philosophical Publishing Co., 1947 ASIN: B00104HMOW&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

During World War II, on March 23, 1944, he was shot and killed by the [[Gestapo]] in a brutal hostage murder on March 23, 1944 in [[Lyon]].
