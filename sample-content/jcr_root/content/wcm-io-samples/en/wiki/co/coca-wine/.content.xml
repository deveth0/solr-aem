In [[Atlanta]], [[John Pemberton]], a pharmacist, developed a beverage based on Vin Mariani, called [[Pemberton&amp;apos;s French Wine Coca]]. It proved popular among American consumers. In 1886, when Georgia introduced [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], Pemberton had to replace the wine in his recipe with non-alcoholic [[syrup]]. The new recipe was similar to, but not the same as, [[Coca-Cola]].&amp;lt;ref name=cocaineorg/&amp;gt;

At the end of the 19th century, the fear of drug abuse made coca-based drinks less popular. This led to the prohibition of cocaine in the United States, and the removal of [[coca alkaloid]] from coca wine as well as Coca-Cola, though [[coca leaf]] remained.&amp;lt;ref name=cocaineorg/&amp;gt; The drink itself became illegal in the United States when its other main drug, alcohol, was banned just a few years later.
