        text="&lt;p&gt;{{Politics of New Zealand}}
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Communist Workers&amp;apos; Group&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Trotskyist]] political group in [[New Zealand]]. Its origins are to be found in a split in the NZ [[Spartacist League]] in 1972 which led to the formation of the [[Communist Left of Australia]] in 1974. The Communist Left of NZ (CLNZ) was formed in 1981. In 1992 the CLNZ fused with [[League for a Revolutionary Communist International]], led by the British group [[Workers Power (UK)|Workers Power]] and became Workers Power (NZ).

In 1994 the CLNZ founding members opposed the LRCI&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;dual defeatist&amp;apos; position in the [[NATO]] bombing of [[Serbia]] and a split with the LRCI took place leading to the formation of the CWG (NZ). Along with the Peruvian and Bolivian groups of the LRCI, it then formed the [[Liaison Committee of Militants for a Revolutionary Communist International]] (CEMICOR) in 1995.

CEMICOR has since dissolved and the CWG (NZ) is now a member of the [[International Trotskyist Fraction]] (FLT) together with [[Workers&amp;apos; Democracy (Argentina)]], the [[International Workers&amp;apos; Party (Chile)]], [[Revolutionary Trotskyist League (Peru)]], [[Red October International (Bolivia)]] and the [[Trotskyist Fraction (Brazil)]].

CWG produces a bimonthy magazine &amp;apos;Class Struggle&amp;apos; and contributes to the international publications of the FLT.
Its members are active in the trades unions, in united fronts opposed to imperialist wars, and international campaigns of solidarity with workers struggles.
