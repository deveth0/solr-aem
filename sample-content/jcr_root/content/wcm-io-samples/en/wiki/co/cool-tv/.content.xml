&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cool TV&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] television channel, which migrated to [[Romania]] after being threatened with closure by Hungarian authorities. The channel was launched in 2004 in the [[Hungarian language]], and in 2005 it also started broadcasting cool stuff.

==History==

===At the beginning===
Originally Cool TV had the target audience of 15–29 urban youths who love music, externals, clothes, trendy lifestyle and extravagance. The channel was launched in 2004 and it is available in 2.5 million households.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://r-time.hu/csatornaink/cool]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
The channel is on a [[24/7]] broadcast schedule, targeting audience not only during the day, but during the night as well. Cool TV airs reruns of series RTL Klub originally purchased or produced as well as series targeting today&amp;apos;s youth. These include: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[South Park]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Married... with Children]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Egy rém rendes család&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[24 (TV series)|24]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Footballer&amp;apos;s Wives]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Futbalista feleségek&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The L Word]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;L&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Queer as Folk (US TV series)|Queer as Folk]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;A fiúk a klubból&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Unit]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Az egység&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Dead Like Me]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Haláli hullák&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Spangli&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Skins&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Desperate Housewives]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Született feleségek&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)

In 2007, Cool TV launched a series of topical shows produced by the channel, such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cool Live and Cool Night&amp;apos;&amp;apos; featuring younger hosts lent to Cool by RTL Klub. The earlier being a youth lifestyle show, and the latter being an adult show including interviews with Hungarian porn stars and producers, as well as occasionally shown soft-core video clips. As of today these talk shows are cancelled.

In 2009, Cool TV purchased the airing rights of the successful Hungarian version of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Whose line is it anyway?]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Beugró]].

===Present===
From August 30, 2010 Cool TV changed image and was rebranded, opening for a wider audience. Since then the channel airs mostly crime procedurals like the CSI franchise, Bones, Castle, Cobra 11, The Mentalist, etc. The move was successful because as of July 2012 Cool TV is the 3rd watched Commercial TV Channel, and most watched cable channel in Hungary (target audience 18-49, prime time 19.00-23.00) beating main competitor [[Viasat 3]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://r-time.hu/csatornaink/cool/ajanlok/cool-a-3-csatorna&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
