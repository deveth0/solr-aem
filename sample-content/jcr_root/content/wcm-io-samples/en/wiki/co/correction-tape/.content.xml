&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Correction tape&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an alternative to [[correction fluid]] used to correct mistakes during typing, or, in some forms, handwriting. One side of the tape, which is placed against the error, is coated in a white, opaque masking material. Pressure applied to the other side of the tape transfers this material to the paper.

Correction tape in its current form was invented by Japanese [[stationery]] product manufacturer Seed in 1989&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.seedr.co.jp/tape/tape2.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and quickly spread throughout the world.

== Types ==

Correction tape is sold in short spools for hand use, or as long rolls to be used in [[typewriter]]s, which apply sudden pressure when a key is struck, and can therefore apply the masking material in exactly the same shape and position as the erroneous character.

Some versions of correction tape are sold in separate dispensers that are used to roll the tape onto paper directly, sometimes known as a correction mouse.

The [[IBM Selectric typewriter]] also offered a &amp;quot;correction tape&amp;quot; that was actually a lift-off tape for use with its carbon film [[typewriter ribbons]].

As it is solid, correction tape is not subject to misuse as an [[inhalant]], unlike most correction fluids.
