        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;counterparty&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (sometimes &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;contraparty&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a term most commonly used in the financial services industry to describe a [[Juristic person|legal entity]], unincorporated entity or collection of entities to which an exposure to financial risk might exist. The word became widely used in the 1980s, particularly at the time of the [[Basel I]] in 1988. Sometimes it used instead of unicorporation. The legal entity notion is using as counterparty.

Well-drafted contracts usually attempt to spell out in explicit detail what each counterparty&amp;apos;s rights and obligations are in every conceivable circumstance, though there are of course limits. There are general provisions for how counterparties are treated under the law, and (at least in [[common law]] legal systems) there are many [[legal precedent]]s that shape the common law.

==Financial services sector==
Within the [[financial services]] sector, the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;market counterparty&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is used to refer to [[government]]s, [[national bank]]s, national monetary authorities and international monetary organisations such as the [[World Bank Group]] that act as the ultimate guarantor for loans and indemnities. The term may also be applied, in a more general sense, to companies acting in this role.

Also within financial services, counterparty can refer to brokers, [[investment bank]]s, and other securities dealers that serve as the  contracting party when completing [[Over-the-counter (finance)|&amp;quot;over the counter&amp;quot;]] securities transactions.  The term is generally used in this context in relation to &amp;quot;[[counterparty risk]]&amp;quot;, which is the risk of monetary loss a firm may be exposed to if the counterparty to an over-the-counter securities trade encounters difficulty meeting its obligations under the terms of the transaction.

==Insurance sector==
Within the [[insurance]] sector, this term is extended to include companies offering or requiring high-level [[Reinsurance#Retrocession|retrocession]] of insurance risk to insurance companies in a role similar to that offered by governments. This term, over time, has become more generally applied to companies offering or requiring retrocession and other forms of [[reinsurance]].
