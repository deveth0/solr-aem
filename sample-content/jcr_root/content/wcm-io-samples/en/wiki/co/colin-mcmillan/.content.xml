&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Colin McMillan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 12 February 1966) is an [[England|English]] retired professional boxer. In a professional career spanning from 1988 to 1997, McMillan fought his way to the British Featherweight title in 1991 with a win over [[Gary De Roux]]. After successfully defending his British title, he added the Commonwealth title in 1992 before beating [[Maurizio Stecca]] for the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] Featherweight belt that same year. Known in fighting circles as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sweet C&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, McMillan lost his WBO belt on his first defence, when he was unable to continue against [[Rubén Darío Palacios]] due to a dislocated shoulder.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-interview-colin-mcmillan-sweet-c-turns-deal-maker-1122464.html | title=The interview Colin McMillan: Sweet C turns deal maker|author=Hubbard, Alan | work=The Independent | date=26 September 1999 | accessdate=24 February 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
