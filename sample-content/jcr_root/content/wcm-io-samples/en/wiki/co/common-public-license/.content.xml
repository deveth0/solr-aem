In [[computing]], the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;CPL&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Common Public License) is a [[free software]] / [[open-source software]] license published by [[IBM]]. The [[Free Software Foundation]] and [[Open Source Initiative]] have approved the license terms of the CPL.

==Definition==

The CPL has the stated aims of supporting and encouraging collaborative [[open source|open-source]] development while still retaining the ability to use the CPL&amp;apos;d content with software licensed under other licenses, including many [[proprietary software|proprietary]] licenses. The [[Eclipse Public License]] (EPL) consists of a slightly modified version of the CPL.

The CPL has some terms that resemble those of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), but some key differences exist. A similarity relates to distribution of a modified [[computer program]]: under either license (CPL or GPL), one must make the source code of a modified program available to others.

CPL, like the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]], allows non-CPL-licensed software to link to a library under CPL without requiring the linked source code to be made available to the licensee.

CPL lacks compatibility with both versions of the GPL because it has a &amp;quot;[[Choice of law clause|choice of law]]&amp;quot; section in section 7, which restricts legal disputes to a certain court.  Another source of incompatibility is the different [[copyleft]] requirements.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#CommonPublicLicense10 Various Licenses and Comments about Them - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)]
&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

To reduce the number of open source licenses, IBM and Eclipse Foundation agreed upon using solely the [[Eclipse Public License]] in the future.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://mmilinkov.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/one-small-step-towards-reducing-license-proliferation/ Mike Milinkovich - One Small Step Towards Reducing License Proliferation]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Open Source Initiative therefore lists the Common Public License as deprecated and superseded by EPL.

==Projects using the Common Public License==

[[Microsoft]] has released its [[WiX|Windows Installer XML]] (WiX) developer tool, [[Windows Template Library]] (WTL) and the [[FlexWiki]] engine under the CPL as [[Sourceforge]] projects.

Some projects of the [[COIN-OR]] Foundation use the CPL.
