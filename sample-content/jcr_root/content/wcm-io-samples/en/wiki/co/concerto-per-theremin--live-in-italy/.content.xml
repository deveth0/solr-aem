&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Concerto per Theremin. Live in Italy&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is [[Lydia Kavina]]&amp;apos;s second [[compact disc]]. It was recorded in [[Italy]] in 1998 and then released on CD by [[Teleura]] in 2000.

==Theremin &amp;amp; Lydia Kavina==

Invented in 1919 in Russia by [[Leon Theremin|Lev Sergeivitch Termen]], the [[Theremin]] was not only the first [[electronic musical instrument]], but also the first (and still the only) instrument played without touching it by moving the hands in the space between two antennas, one of which controls intonation and the other the volume.

[[Lydia Kavina]] is universally recognised as being the greatest virtuoso of the [[Theremin]] in the world{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. The niece of one of [[Leon Theremin|Lev Termen]]&amp;apos;s first-degree cousins, Kavina began studying the [[Theremin]] under the direction of [[Leon Theremin|Termen]] himself when she was nine years old. Five years later, she was ready to give her first [[Theremin]] concert, which marked the beginning of a musical career that has so far led to more than 500 [[theatre]], [[radio]] and [[television]] performances throughout the world.

In addition to giving concerts, Kavina is a composer of music for the [[Theremin]] (three of her works can be heard on this disc) and teaches the instrument in [[Russia]], the [[United States]] and [[Western Europe]].

Together with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]], she participated in creating the sound track of the Oscar-winning film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ed Wood (movie)|Ed Wood]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 1999 has been published Lydia&amp;apos;s first disc entitled &amp;quot;[[Music from the Ether]]&amp;quot;.
