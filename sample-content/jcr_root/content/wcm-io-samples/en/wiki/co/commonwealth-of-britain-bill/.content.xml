        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Commonwealth of Britain Bill&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] first introduced in 1991 by [[Tony Benn]], then a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]]. It proposed abolishing the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]], with the [[United Kingdom]] becoming a &amp;quot;democratic, federal and secular commonwealth&amp;quot;, in effect, a [[republic]] with a written [[constitution]]. It was read in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] a number of times until his retirement in 2001, but never achieved a [[second reading]]. Under the bill:

*The constitutional status of [[the Crown]] would be ended;
*The [[Church of England]] would be [[Disestablishment|disestablished]];
*The [[head of state]] would be the [[President]], elected by a joint sitting of both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament;
*Many functions of the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|Royal Prerogative]] would not be transferred to the President, but instead to Parliament;
*The [[Her Majesty&amp;apos;s Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] would be abolished, and replaced by a [[Council of State]];
*The [[House of Lords]] would be replaced by an elected [[House of the People]], with equal representation of men and women;
*The [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] would similarly have [[Reverse discrimination|equal]] representation of men and women;
*[[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] would have their own National Parliaments;
*[[County Court]] judges and [[magistrate]]s would be elected; and
*British jurisdiction over [[Northern Ireland]] would be ended.
