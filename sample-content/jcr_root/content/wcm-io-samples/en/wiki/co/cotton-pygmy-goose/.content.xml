==Description==
[[File:Nettapus coromandelianus male - Bueng Boraphet.jpg|thumb|left|Male in [[Thailand]]]]

Small individuals of this species are the smallest waterfowl on earth, at as little as {{convert|160|g|oz|abbr=on}} and {{convert|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}. White predominates in this bird&amp;apos;s plumage. Bill short, deep at base, and goose-like.

Male in breeding plumage is glossy blackish green crown, with white head, neck, and underparts; a prominent black collar and white wing-bar.  Rounded head and short legs.
In flight, the wings are green with a white band, making the male conspicuous even amongst the huge flying flocks of the [[Lesser Whistling Duck]], which share the habitat.
Female paler, without either black collar and only a narrow or
nonexistent strip of white wing-bar.
In non-breeding plumage (eclipse) male resembles female except for his white wing-bar.
Flocks on water bodies (jheels), etc.

The call is a peculiar clucking, uttered in flight

==Distribution==

It is largely resident, apart from dispersion in the wet season, but [[China|Chinese]] birds make long-distance [[bird migration|migrations]] to winter further south. It nests in tree holes, laying 8â€“15 eggs.

This is an abundant species in Asia, although the slightly larger Australian race appears to be declining in numbers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Found on all still freshwater lakes (jheels), rain-filled ditches, inundated paddy fields, irrigation tanks, etc. Becomes very tame on village tanks wherever it is unmolested and has become inured to human proximity. Swift on the wing, and can dive creditably on occasion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Behaviour==

Its food is chiefly seeds and vegetable matter, especially [[Nymphaeaceae|water lilies]]; also insects, crustaceans, etc.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The nesting season is July to September (SW. monsoon).{{Where|date=July 2011}} Its nest is a natural hollow in a tree-trunk standing in or near water, sometimes lined with grass, rubbish and feathers. It lays 6 to 12 eggs, which are ivory white.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
