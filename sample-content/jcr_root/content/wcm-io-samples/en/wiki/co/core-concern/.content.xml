In [[computer science]], a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;core concern&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of the main [[Concern (computer science)|concern]]s a [[computer program|program]] is written for. The main coding of the application is to satisfy the core concerns, such as doing the tasks as visualized. Other coding which is to document changes, maintain histories and other non-direct actions supportive of the core tasks are not core concerns.

==Example==
If writing an [[application software|application]] for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Medical Records&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the bookkeeping and indexing of such records is a core concern, while [[Data logging|logging]] a history of changes to the record database or user database, or an authentication system, would be [[cross-cutting concern]]s since they touch more parts of the program.

The sum of all core concerns is the [[business logic]] of a program, while all other [[aspect (computer science)|aspect]]s of the program are needed for proper execution, but not part of the actual business logic.
