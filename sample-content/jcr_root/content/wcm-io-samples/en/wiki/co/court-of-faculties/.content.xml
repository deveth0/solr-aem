Under English [[ecclesiastical law]], the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Court of Faculties&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a tribunal of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and is attached to the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

The jurisdiction conferred upon the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] by the Ecclesiastical Licences Act 1533 is exercised by the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Court of Faculties&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. This includes the appointment and removal of notaries public, and the granting of those licences and faculties which are the concern of the Archbishop of Canterbury, such as special and ordinary marriage licences. The [[Lambeth degrees]] are also conferred by the Court of Faculties. The [[Master of the Faculties]], who is appointed by the Archbishop, subject to the approval of the Crown, is also the [[Dean of the Arches]].

The court:

# creates rights as to [[pew]]s, [[monument]]s, and rights of [[burial]];
# grants licenses such as [[marriage]] licenses, a faculty to erect an organ in a parish [[Church (building)|church]], to level a churchyard, or to exhume bodies buried in a church [[cemetery]]. These rights are granted under 25 Hen VII c. 21; and
# issues [[notary public|notaries public]], after the passage of the Ecclesiastical Licences Act 1533 (UK), which was a direct result of the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in [[England]]. Notaries public in some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions such as New Zealand and the State of Queensland, Australia are still appointed through the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury by the Court of Faculties.
# issues faculties for the creation and conferral of [[Lambeth degrees]].
