==Chapter 8 Great Council of Chiefs (Bose Levu Vakaturaga)==

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chapter 8: Executive Government.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Chapter 8&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the [[Constitution of Fiji|Fiji Constitution]] is titled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Great Council of Chiefs (Bose Levu Vakaturaga).&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  Its single section &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;(Section 116)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; enshrines in the constitution a powerful feudal institution that has played a pivotal role in Fiji&amp;apos;s history.

===Section 116 Bose Levu Vakaturaga===
{{main|Great Council of Chiefs}}
This chapter, the shortest in the [[Fiji]] Constitution, stipulates that the Great Council of Chiefs, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bose Levu Vakaturaga&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Fijian language|Fijian]], originally established under the [[Fijian Affairs Act]], continues in existence, and that its membership, functions, operations, and procedures are as prescribed by that act.

The Great Council of Chiefs is a very old body, which has its roots in the chiefly councils established by [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau|Ratu Seru Epenisa Cakobau]] in the 1800s.  It was retained as a consultative body by the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial rulers.  It had no formal political role, however, until Fiji became independent in 1970.  Under the independence constitution, it gained the authority to nominate 8 of the then 22 [[Senate (Fiji)|Senators]].

Today, the Great Council of Chiefs nominates 14 Senators out of 32, and also serves as an electoral college to choose the [[List of Presidents of Fiji|President]] and [[List of Vice-Presidents of Fiji|Vice-President]].  But these powers are not stated in this chapter; they are set out elsewhere in the constitution.

Although previously established by an [[Act of Parliament]], the framers of the 1997 Constitution thought it best to enshrine it there.  With increased political representation being granted to [[Indo-Fijian]]s, the [[Ratu|chiefs]] felt they needed the security of having the Great Council enshrined in the constitution, and not merely in a legal document that could be amended at the whim of politicians.
