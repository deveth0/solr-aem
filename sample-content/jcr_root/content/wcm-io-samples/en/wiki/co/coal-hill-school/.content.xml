        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Coal Hill School&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a fictional school in the television series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Doctor Who]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It is a [[comprehensive school]] in Coal Hill Road, located in the [[Shoreditch]] area of [[London]]. The school arms consist of a shield with the Cross of St George between two dragons segreant, with the motto &amp;quot;Domine dirige nos&amp;quot;, which translates as &amp;quot;Lord, guide us&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The Coal Hill School is the setting of much of the very first episode of the series, &amp;quot;[[An Unearthly Child]]&amp;quot;, first broadcast in November 1963. The episode takes place in the same year. In the episode, two teachers at the school, science teacher [[Ian Chesterton]] and history teacher [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]], discover that one of their students, [[Susan Foreman]], is an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[time travel]]ler who has been attending the school as her grandfather, [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] (the central character of the series), makes repairs on their time machine, the [[TARDIS]].

The school appeared in the series again almost twenty-five years later in the October 1988 story &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In this [[List of Doctor Who serials|serial]], a nostalgia-laden tribute to the show that kicked off its 25th anniversary season, the [[Seventh Doctor]] returns to 1963 to complete some business left unfinished by his hurried departure on the previous occasion. The school is a featured location, as a group of [[Dalek]]s set up a base there while attempting to locate a powerful [[Time Lord]] artifact, the [[Hand of Omega]], the Doctor had previously hidden in the area. The school sign names the incumbent Headmaster as H Parson.

Coal Hill School is also set to make another appearance in the 50th anniversary special. The school sign names the Headmaster W Coburn, making reference to Anthony Coburn, who wrote [[An Unearthly Child]]. It also says that I. Chesterton (Ian), is the head of governors for the school, perhaps suggesting he could have a small appearance in the special.

[[Sam Jones (Doctor Who)|Sam Jones]], a [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] from the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] spin-off novels, also attended Coal Hill School.
In the 2010 episode &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Vampires of Venice]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the [[Eleventh Doctor]] briefly produces a [[library card]] from Shoreditch Library with the photo ID of his [[First Doctor|original incarnation]].
