The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,  also &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Commission on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; CCAMLR&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,  is part of the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]. The Convention was opened for signature on 1 August 1980 and entered into force on 7 April 1982 by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, headquartered in [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]]. The goal is to preserve marine life and environmental integrity in and near [[Antarctica]].

It was established in large part to concerns that an increase in [[krill]] catches in the [[Southern Ocean]] could have a serious impact on populations of other marine life which are dependent upon krill for food.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ccamlr.org/ |title=Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources  |work=ccamlr.org |year=2011 |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was signed by 14 states and has been ratified by 35 states and the [[European Community]].&amp;lt;ref name = ratifications&amp;gt;[http://www.ccamlr.org/en/system/files/CCAMLR%20Status%20list%20as%20at%2028%20March%202013.pdf]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; As of May 2013, the states that have ratified the convention are: [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[China]], [[Cook Islands]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Mauritius]], [[Namibia]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Pakistan]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]] (ratified as the [[Soviet Union]]), [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Ukraine]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Vanuatu]].&amp;lt;ref name = ratifications/&amp;gt; [[East Germany]] is a former state party.

In 1985, CCAMLR set up the [[Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources Ecosystem Monitoring Programme|Ecosystem Monitoring Programme]] (CEMP) to further monitor the effects of fishing and harvesting of species in the area.

The CCAMLR is to meet in July 2013, where it will vote on the establishment of the world&amp;apos;s largest marine protected area in the [[Ross Sea]], [[Antarctica]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Sanford-to-back-marine-proposal/tabid/1160/articleID/294582/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Sanford to back marine proposal| date=17 April 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
