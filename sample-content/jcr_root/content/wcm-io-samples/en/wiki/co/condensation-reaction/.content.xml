A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;condensation reaction&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also commonly referred to as dehydration synthesis, is a [[chemical reaction]] in which two [[molecule]]s or moieties ([[functional groups]]) combine to form a larger molecule, together with the loss of a small molecule.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Gold&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Condensation Reaction|file=C01238|year=1994}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Possible small molecules lost are [[water]], [[hydrogen chloride]], [[methanol]], or [[acetic acid]]. The word &amp;quot;condensation&amp;quot; suggests a process in which two or more things are brought &amp;quot;together&amp;quot; (Latin &amp;quot;con&amp;quot;) to form something &amp;quot;dense&amp;quot;, like in condensation from gaseous to liquid state of matter; this does not imply, however, that condensation reaction products have greater density than reactants.

When two separate molecules react, the condensation is termed [[intermolecular]]. A simple example is the condensation of two [[amino acid]]s to form the [[peptide bond]] characteristic of [[proteins]]. This reaction example is the opposite of [[hydrolysis]], which splits a chemical entity into two parts through the action of the polar water molecule, which itself splits into [[hydroxide]] and [[hydrogen]] ions. Hence energy is released.

If the union is between atoms or groups of the same molecule, the reaction is termed [[intramolecular]] condensation, and in many cases leads to ring formation. An example is the [[Dieckmann condensation]], in which the two [[ester]] groups of a single diester molecule react with each other to lose a small [[alcohol]] molecule and form a β-ketoester product.

==Mechanism==
Many condensation reactions follow a [[nucleophilic acyl substitution]] or an [[aldol condensation]] [[reaction mechanism]]. Other condensations, such as the [[acyloin condensation]] are triggered by [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] or [[single electron transfer]] conditions.

==Condensation reactions in polymer chemistry==
In one type of polymerization reaction, a series of condensation steps take place whereby [[monomer]]s or monomer chains add to each other to form longer chains. This is termed &amp;apos;condensation polymerization&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;[[step-growth polymerization]]&amp;apos;, and occurs for example in the synthesis of [[polyester]]s or [[nylon]]s. It may be either a homopolymerization of a single monomer A-B with two different end groups that condense or a [[copolymer]]ization of two co-monomers A-A and B-B. Small molecules are usually liberated in these condensation steps, in contrast to [[polyaddition]] reactions with no liberation of small molecules.

In general, condensation polymers form more slowly than addition polymers, often requiring heat. They are generally lower in molecular weight. Monomers are consumed early in the reaction; the terminal functional groups remain active throughout and short chains combine to form longer chains. A high conversion rate is required to achieve high molecular weights as per [[Carothers&amp;apos; equation]].

Bifunctional monomers lead to linear chains (and therefore [[thermoplastic]] polymers), but, when the monomer [[polymer#functionality|functionality]] exceeds two, the product is a [[branching (chemistry)|branched]] chain that may yield a [[thermoset]] polymer.

==Applications==
This type of reaction is used as a basis for the making of many important [[polymer]]s, for example: [[nylon]], [[polyester]], and other [[condensation polymer]]s and various [[epoxy|epoxies]]. It is also the basis for the laboratory formation of [[silicate]]s and [[polyphosphate]]s. The reactions that form acid [[anhydride]]s from their constituent acids are typically condensation reactions.

Many biological transformations are condensation reactions. [[Polypeptide synthesis]], [[polyketide]] synthesis, [[terpene]] syntheses, [[phosphorylation]], and [[glycosylation]]s are a few examples of this reaction.

A large number of such reactions are used in synthetic organic chemistry. Other examples include:

*[[Acyloin condensation]]
*[[Aldol condensation]]
*[[Benzoin condensation]] (this is not technically a condensation, but is called so for historical reasons)&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Gold&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
*[[Claisen condensation]]
*[[Claisen–Schmidt condensation]]
*[[Darzens condensation]] (glycidic ester condensation)
*[[Dieckmann condensation]]
*[[Guareschi–Thorpe condensation]]
*[[Knoevenagel condensation]]
*[[Michael condensation]]
*[[Pechmann condensation]]
*[[Rap–Stoermer condensation]]
*[[Self-condensation]] or symmetrical aldol condensation
*[[Ziegler condensation]]
