&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Consumer electronics&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (abbreviated &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;CE&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) are [[Electronics|electronic]] equipment intended for everyday use, most often in [[entertainment]], [[communication]]s and [[office]] productivity.  [[Radio broadcasting]] in the early 20th century brought the first major consumer product, the broadcast receiver.  Later products include [[personal computer]]s, [[telephone]]s, [[MP3 player]]s, [[audio equipment]], [[television]]s, [[calculator]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] [[automotive electronics]],digital [[sphygmomanometer]]s, digital [[Glucose meter]]s, [[digital camera]]s and players and recorders using video media such as [[DVD]]s, [[VCR]]s or [[camcorder]]s. Increasingly these products have become based on digital technologies, and have largely merged with the computer industry in what is increasingly referred to as the [[consumerization]] of [[information technology]] such as those invented by [[Apple Inc.]] and [[MIT Media Lab]]. The largest electronics companies are mostly from Japan and to lesser extent South Korea and Taiwan. Some American companies do contract manufacturing done in East Asia.

The latest consumer electronics are previewed yearly at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], at which many industry pioneers speak.

==Trends==
One overriding characteristic of consumer electronic products is the trend of ever-falling prices. This is driven by gains in manufacturing efficiency and [[automation]], lower [[Labour (economics)|labor]] costs as manufacturing has moved to lower-wage countries, and improvements in [[semiconductor]] design.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qualitydigest.com/inside/quality-insider-news/china-moves-automate-electronics-manufacturing.html |title=China Moves to Automate Electronics Manufacturing |author=Mike Deng|date=23 October 2012|work= |publisher=Quality Digest|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Semiconductor components benefit from [[Moore&amp;apos;s Law]], an observed principle which states that, for a given price, semiconductor functionality doubles every two years.

While consumer electronics continues in its trend of [[Technological convergence|convergence]], combining elements of many products, consumers face different decisions when purchasing. There is an ever increasing need to keep product information updated and comparable, for the consumer to make an informed choice.  Style, price, specification and performance are all relevant.  There is a gradual shift towards [[e-commerce]] web-storefronts.

Many products include [[Internet connectivity]] using technologies such as [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]] or [[Ethernet]]. Products not traditionally associated with computer use (such as [[Internet TV|TV]]s or [[Hi-Fi]] equipment) now provide options to connect to the Internet or to a computer using a [[home network]] to provide access to digital content.  The desire for [[High definition television|High definition (HD)]] content has led the industry to develop a number of technologies, such as [[WirelessHD]] or [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]], which are optimized for distribution of HD content between CE devices in a home.

== Environmental impact ==
[[Standby power]] used by consumer electronics and appliance while they are turned off accounts for 5 to 10% of household energy consumption, adding an estimated $3 billion to annual energy costs in the USA. &amp;quot;In the average home, 75% of the electricity used to power home electronics is consumed while the products are turned off.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/consumer/tips/home_office.html EERE Energy Savers: Home Office and Home Electronics&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
