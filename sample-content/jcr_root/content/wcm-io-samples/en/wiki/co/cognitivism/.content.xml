        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cognitivism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; may refer to:
* [[Cognitivism (ethics)]], the philosophical view that ethical sentences express [[proposition]]s, and hence are capable of being true or false.
* [[Cognitivism (psychology)]], a psychological approach to understanding the mind which argues that mental function can be understood as the &amp;apos;internal&amp;apos; manipulation of symbols.
* [[Cognitivism (aesthetics)]] is the view that cognitive psychology can help us better understand art and our response to it.
* [[Anecdotal cognitivism]], a psychological methodology for interpreting animal behavior in terms of mental states, comparable to the mental states of humans. For example, the methodology attempts to determine the cognitive capacity of animals through observation without the necessity that this observation be regulated or controlled as in an experiment; however, behavior in an experiment can be interpreted using the methodology.
* [[Cognitivism (learning theory)]],  the theory that humans generate knowledge and meaning through sequential development of an individualâ€™s cognitive abilities.
* [[Cognition]], the study of the human mind
* [[Cognitive anthropology]]
