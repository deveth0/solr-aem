&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cosmic noise&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;galactic radio noise&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is [[random noise]] that originates [[Outer space|outside the Earth&amp;apos;s atmosphere]]. It can be detected and heard on [[radio]] receivers.

== Elaboration ==
Cosmic noise characteristics are similar to those of [[thermal noise]]. Cosmic noise is experienced at frequencies above about 15&amp;amp;nbsp;MHz when highly directional antennas are pointed toward the sun or to certain other regions of the sky such as the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. Celestial objects like [[Quasar]]s, super dense objects that lie far from Earth, emit electromagnetic waves in its full spectrum including radio waves. We can also hear the fall of a [[meteorite]] in a radio receiver; as the falling object burns from friction with the Earth&amp;apos;s atmosphere, ionizing surrounding gases, thereby producing [[radio waves]]. [[Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation]] (CMBR) from outer space, discovered by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]], who later won the [[Nobel Prize]] for this discovery, is also a form of cosmic noise. CMBR is thought to be a relic of the [[Big Bang]], and pervades the space almost homogeneously over the entire [[celestial sphere]]. The [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the CMBR is wide, though the peak is in the microwave range.
