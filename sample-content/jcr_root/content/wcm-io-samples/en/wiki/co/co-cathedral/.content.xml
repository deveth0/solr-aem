        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;co-cathedral&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[cathedral]] church which shares the function of being a [[bishop]]&amp;apos;s seat, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[cathedra]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, with another cathedral. Instances of this occurred in England before the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the [[diocese]]s of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and [[Wells]], and of [[Coventry]] and [[Lichfield]], hence the names of these dioceses. In France the [[bishop of Couserans]] (a see suppressed by the [[French Revolution]]) had two co-cathedral churches at [[Saint-Lizier]], and the [[bishop of Sisteron]] (a see also suppressed) had a second throne in the church of [[Forcalquier]] which is still called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;La Con-cathÃ©drale&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

== United Kingdom ==

In the case of [[York]] the [[collegiate church]]es of [[Beverley Minster|Beverley]], [[Ripon Minster|Ripon]] and [[Southwell Minster|Southwell]] were almost in the same position, but although the archbishop had a stall in each he had no diocesan cathedra in them, and the chapters were not united with that of the metropolitan church in the direct government of the diocese, or the election of the archbishop, nor had they those other rights which were held to denote the cathedral character of a church.

===Catholic Church===
[[File:St Mary&amp;apos;s Cathedral Basilica, Galveston.jpg|thumb|right|St. Mary Cathedral Basilica, located in [[Galveston, Texas]], one of the two Roman Catholic See cities of the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston.]]
In the United States, there are several instances in which a [[Roman Catholic]] diocese maintains two [[Episcopal See]] cities, each with their own cathedral or co-cathedral.  Examples include the [[Cathedral of Saint Paul (Minnesota)|Cathedral of Saint Paul]] and the [[Basilica of Saint Mary, Minneapolis|Basilica of Saint Mary]] in the [[Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis]] (Minnesota) and [[St. Mary&amp;apos;s Cathedral Basilica, Galveston|St. Mary&amp;apos;s Cathedral Basilica]] and the [[Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in Houston|Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart]] in the [[Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston]] (Texas).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.archgh.org/cocathedral/dedication/history-cocathedral.htm Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston: History of the Cathedral &amp;amp; Co-Cathedral&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Other instances include the Diocese of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown|Altoona-Johnstown]] (Pennsylvania), the Diocese of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend|Fort Wayne-South Bend]] (Indiana), the Diocese of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Great Falls-Billings|Great Falls-Billings]] (Montana),
the Diocese of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux|Houma-Thibodaux]] (Louisiana), the Diocese of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-Saint Joseph|Kansas City-Saint Joseph]] (Missouri), the Diocese of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pensacola-Tallahassee|Pensacola-Tallahassee]] (Florida), the Diocese of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau|Springfield-Cape Girardeau]] (Missouri),
and the Diocese of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston|Wheeling-Charleston]] (West Virginia).

There are also four instances in the United States in which a cathedral and its co-cathedral are in the same city.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.gcatholic.com/churches/data/cathUS.htm Cathedrals in the United States&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This usually occurs when a historically important cathedral becomes too small to serve a growing population, and a larger co-cathedral is constructed to accommodate larger services. Examples include:
*The [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace]] and the [[Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus]], both within walking distance of each other in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu|Diocese of Honolulu]] (Hawaii).
*The [[Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Burlington, Vermont)|Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception]] and [[St Joseph&amp;apos;s Co-Cathedral]] in the [[Diocese of Burlington]] (Vermont).
*The [[Cathedral of Mary Our Queen]] and the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Archdiocese of Baltimore]] (Maryland).
*The [[Cathedral_Basilica_of_St._James_(Brooklyn)|Cathedral Basilica of St. James]] and the [[Co-Cathedral_of_St._Joseph_(Brooklyn)|Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph]] in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn|Diocese of Brooklyn]]

An example in Canada is the Cathedral of the Holy Family and St. Paul&amp;apos;s Cathedral in the Diocese of Saskatoon in Saskatchewan.

===Episcopal Church===
In the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], both the [[Diocese of Iowa]] and the [[Diocese of Minnesota]] each have two cathedrals, both located in different cities; however, they are not styled &amp;quot;co-cathedrals.&amp;quot;
