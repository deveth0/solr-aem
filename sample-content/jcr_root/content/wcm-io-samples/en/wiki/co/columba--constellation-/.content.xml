&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Columba&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small, faint [[constellation]] created in the late sixteenth century. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[dove]]. It is located just south of [[Canis Major]] and [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]].

==History==
Columba was created by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] astronomer [[Petrus Plancius]] in 1592 in order to differentiate the &amp;apos;unformed stars&amp;apos; of the large constellation [[Canis Major]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=120-121}} Plancius first depicted Columba on the small celestial planispheres of his large wall map of 1592. It is also shown on his smaller world map of 1594 and on early Dutch celestial globes.

Plancius originally named the constellation &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Columba Noachi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;[[Noah]]&amp;apos;s Dove&amp;quot;), referring to the dove that gave Noah the information that the [[Great Flood]] was receding. This name is found on early 17th-century celestial globes and star atlases (such as [[Johann Bayer|Bayer&amp;apos;s]] [[Uranometria]] of 1603&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.lindahall.org/services/digital/ebooks/bayer/bayer88.shtml Canis Maior and Columba in Bayers Uranometria 1603 (Linda Hall Library)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;). Columba may also represent the dove released by [[Jason and the Argonauts]] at the [[Black Sea]]&amp;apos;s mouth; it helped them navigate the dangerous [[Symplegades]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=120-121}}

In the [[Society Islands]], Alpha Columbae (Phaet) was called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ana-iva&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=281}}

===Stars===
{{seealso|List of stars in Columba}}
Columba is rather inconspicuous, the brightest star, [[Alpha Columbae]], being only of magnitude 2.7. Alpha Columbae, a blue-white star, is traditionally called Phact, which means &amp;quot;ring dove&amp;quot;. Alpha Columbae is 268 light-years from Earth. The only other named star in Columba is [[Beta Columbae]], which has the name Wazn. It is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 3.1, 86 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=120-121}}

Columba is the constellation that is at the solar antapex - the Earth (and Sun) is moving away from its direction as the solar system moves through space.

The constellation contains the [[runaway star]] [[Mu Columbae|μ Columbae]], which was probably expelled from the [[Iota Orionis|ι Orionis]] system.

===Deep-sky objects===
There is one [[globular cluster]] in Columba, 7th-magnitude [[NGC 1851]]. It is 35,000 light-years from Earth and is resolvable in medium-sized amateur telescopes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=120-121}}
