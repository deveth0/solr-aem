In [[Greek mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Coroebus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Lang-el|Κόροιβος}}) may refer to:

*Coroebus, son of King [[Mygdon of Phrygia]]. He came to the aid of [[Troy]] during the [[Trojan War]] out of love for Princess [[Cassandra]].  During the Sack of Troy, Coroebus convinced some of his fellow soldiers, including [[Aeneas]], to dress in enemy armor to disguise themselves.  When he tried to defend Cassandra from rape by [[Ajax the Lesser]], he was killed, either by [[Peneleos]], [[Diomedes]] or [[Neoptolemus]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Virgil]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Aeneid]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 341 - 343&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Description Of Greece,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 10. 27. 1&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

*Coroebus of [[Argos]], who slew Poene, the personification of punishment sent upon Argos by [[Apollo]] in retribution for the deaths of his lover [[Psamathe]] and their son Linus. Thereupon Apollo struck the city with plague, which made Coroebus decide to go to [[Delphi]] to ask to be punished individually, so that the city didn&amp;apos;t have to suffer. The [[Pythia]] told him to never return home, but to take up a tripod and carry it until he would drop it, then settle on the spot where it would happen. The tripod slipped out of his hands as he had reached the [[Geraneia]]n Mountains, where he founded a town known as Tripodiscoi (&amp;quot;Little Tripods&amp;quot;). The tomb of Coroebus was shown in [[Megara]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Description of Greece&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1. 43. 7 - 8&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

*Coroebus, a defender of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] against the [[Seven Against Thebes|Seven]], killed by [[Parthenopaeus]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Statius]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Thebaid (Latin poem)|Thebaid]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 9. 745&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
