&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cocoparra&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a national park in [[New South Wales]] ([[Australia]]), 457&amp;amp;nbsp;km west of [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]].
[[File:Cocoparra valley view.jpg|thumb|left|Store Creek in Cocoparra National Park]]
Cocoparra National Park is located 25 kilometres northeast of Griffith, in the [[Riverina]] region of south western New South Wales.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;travel&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web | title = Cocoparra National Park | work =  | publisher = TotalTravel.com | date =  | url = http://www.totaltravel.com.au/travel/nsw/riverina/griffith/attractions/gardens/cocoparra-national/details/ | accessdate = 25 October 2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It includes a prominent range of hills such as Bingar Mountain, 455 metres above sea level and Brogden Mountain, 390 metres above sea level, in an otherwise largely flat landscape. Adjoining the national park to the north is Cocoparra Nature Reserve. The national park was gazetted in 1969 and has an area of 8358 hectares. The nature reserve was dedicated in 1963 with an area of 4647 hectares (Cocoparra National Park Plan of Management 1995).  The Binya-Cocoparra area is classified by [[BirdLife International]] as an [[Important Bird Area]] because of its relatively large population (of up to 50 individuals) of the [[near threatened]] [[Painted Honeyeater]], as well as the [[Diamond Firetail]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Binya-Cocoparra|accessdate=2 June 2011 |work= Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The climate is [[Semi-arid climate|semi arid]]. The vegetation communities reflect this, with [[wattles]], [[orchids]], [[ironbark]] and blue-tinged [[Callitris|cypress pines]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;travel&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

The geology comprises Upper Devonian sandstones, siltsones and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]].

There are a number of day use (picnic) areas in the park and a campground at Woolshed Flat.
