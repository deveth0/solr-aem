It lies on the north bank of the [[River Tweed]] in [[Berwickshire]], while [[Northumberland]] in [[England]] lies to the south bank, with [[Cornhill-on-Tweed]] the nearest village.  A former [[burgh]], Coldstream is the home of the [[Coldstream Guards]], a [[regiment]] in the [[British Army]], and is the location where [[Edward I of England]] invaded Scotland in 1296.

In February 1316 during the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|Sir James Douglas]] defeated  a numerically superior force of Gascon soldiery led by [[Edmond de Caillou]] at the [[Battle of Skaithmuir|Skaithmuir]] to the north of the town.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Coldstream was a popular centre for runaway [[marriage]]s, much like [[Gretna Green]], as it lay on a major road (now the [[A697 road|A697]]). Notable buildings in the town include the [[toll house]] where marriages were conducted, and [[The Hirsel]], which is the family seat of the [[Earls of Home]].

An imposing monument to [[Charles Marjoribanks]], MP for [[Berwickshire]], stands at the east end of the town, near the Coldstream Bridge.

[[Alec Douglas-Home]], who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of the [[United Kingdom]] from 1963 to 1964, is buried in Coldstream.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;amp;GRid=11442]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Each year, during the first week of August, Coldstream hosts a traditional &amp;quot;Civic Week&amp;quot; where it includes historical aspects of the town&amp;apos;s history such as the Torchlight procession and horse-rides to the Battle of Flodden battlefield.

A history of the town has been published by Coldstream and District Local History Society, [http://www.coldstreamhistorysociety.co.uk/index.php/about/publications/ &amp;apos;Second to None  A History of Coldstream&amp;apos;], 2009.

Books by [http://www.antonychessell.co.uk Antony Chessell] relating to the town and surrounding area are &amp;apos;Coldstream Building Snippets  Cans, Quoins and Coursers&amp;apos;, 2010; &amp;apos;The Braw Trees of Coldstream&amp;apos;, 2011 and &amp;apos;Leet Water From Source to Tweed&amp;apos;, 2012.
