The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;coat of arms of Canberra&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was created by the Commonwealth Department of Home Affairs and Territories in 1927, in response to a request by the Commonwealth Department of Defence,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nla&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-pa-http%253A%252F%252Fwww.basis.act.gov.au%252FDUSLibrary%252FImagesACT.nsf%252F3506a89b45287c52ca256abc000c49a8%252F3736769288053aaf4a256ca70016fe05!OpenDocument The Coat of Arms of the City of Canberra]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;National Library of Australia: Picture Australia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Accessed 1 July 2009.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; who wanted to use it on the newly commissioned &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[HMAS Canberra (D33)|HMAS Canberra]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nla&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

The [[Federal Capital Commission]] (FCC) announced a competition to design a [[coat of arms]] for both the ACT and the FCC.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nla&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

In April 1928, the design of one Mr C. R. Wylie, having won the competition, was sent to the [[College of Arms]], in London, for approval.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nla&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; The coat of arms at this stage did not include a motto.  After minor adjustments, King George V granted the design by Royal Warrant dated 8 October 1928. The College of Arms issued the official exemplification (artistic rendition) and blazon (description) on 7 November 1928, along with a [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;nla&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

==Symbolism==
The various symbols of the coat of arms are explained below:
*The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;crown&amp;apos;&amp;apos; symbolises [[Queen of Australia|Royal]] authority;
*The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;mace&amp;apos;&amp;apos; symbolises the [[Parliament of Australia]];
*The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;sword&amp;apos;&amp;apos; symbolises the [[Sword of State]];
*The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;castle&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has three towers, symbolise the three branches of government (executive, legislature and judiciary);
*The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;White Rose&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the badge of the [[Duke of York]] who opened the old [[Parliament of Australia]] building in 1927, and who would later be crowned as [[King George VI of the United Kingdom]].
*The crowned &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[portcullis]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; again symbolises the parliament, this being the traditional symbol of the [[Palace of Westminster]] (which houses the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]);
*Behind the portcullis is a Gum tree which symbolises Canberra&amp;apos;s nickname &amp;quot;The Bush Capital&amp;quot;;
*The supporters are the Australian [[black swan]], representing the [[Australian Aborigine]]s, and the European white [[swan]], representing the white settlers.
*The motto is &amp;quot;For the Queen, the Law and the People&amp;quot; which is the English translation of &amp;quot;Pro Rege, Lege et Grege&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.archives.act.gov.au/home/educational_resource/find_of_the_month/2008/november_2008/previous_find_of_the_month&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
