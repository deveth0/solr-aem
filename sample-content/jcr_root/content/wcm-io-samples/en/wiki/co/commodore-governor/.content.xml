In [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Commodore-Governor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a British [[Royal Navy]] official who was commander of the annual fishing convoy which left England each spring to fish off Newfoundland and was charged with protecting the convoys from harm. He was also responsible for various administrative and judicial functions, including assisting the [[fishing admiral]]s in maintaining law and order and compiling the annual report on the fishery for the English government. By 1818,  the [[colony]] had a significant enough permanent population to justify having a resident [[governor]].
