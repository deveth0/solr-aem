[[File:Constitution Hill.jpg|thumb|right|Constitution Hill from [[Wellington Arch]]]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Constitution Hill&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a road in the [[City of Westminster]] in [[London]]. It connects the western end of [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] (just in front of [[Buckingham Palace]]) with [[Hyde Park Corner]], and is bordered by [[Buckingham Palace Gardens]] and [[Green Park]].  The term &amp;quot;Hill&amp;quot; is something of a misnomer; there is barely detectable slope but most observers would regard the road as flat.  An old lane on this route was enhanced in connection with the development of [[Buckingham Palace]] in the 1820s. It formed an official route from the palace to [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. It is now closed to traffic on Sundays.

The road obtained its name in the 17th century from King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]&amp;apos;s habit of taking &amp;quot;constitutional&amp;quot; walks there. In Strype&amp;apos;s Map, 1720, it is marked &amp;quot;Road to Kensington&amp;quot;. In John Smith&amp;apos;s map of 1724, it is called &amp;quot;Constitution Hill&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Wheatley, Henry Benjamin. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;London Past and Present: Its History, Associations, and Traditions&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. 1891, p. 452.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

It was the scene of three assassination attempts against Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]]â€”in 1840 (by [[Edward Oxford]]), 1842 (by John Francis) and 1849 (by William Hamilton). In 1850, the former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] was thrown from his horse on Constitution Hill by the gate into Green Park; he suffered a fatal injury and died three days later.

[[Wellington Arch]] at Hyde Park Corner was originally the culmination of the route, but the effect is somewhat muted now that the Arch stands at the centre of a busy traffic island. There is a recent war memorial to Commonwealth soldiers near the top of Constitution Hill, just before Hyde Park Corner; the memorial is known as the [[Memorial Gates (Constitution Hill)|Memorial Gates]].

There are other streets called &amp;apos;Constitution Hill&amp;apos;, for example in [[Birmingham]].
