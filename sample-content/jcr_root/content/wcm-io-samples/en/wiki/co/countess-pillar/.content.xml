        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Countess Pillar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 17th-century [[monument]] near [[Brougham, Cumbria]], [[England]], between [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] and [[Appleby-in-Westmorland|Appleby]]. It is two miles east of Penrith on the [[A66 road (England)|A66]]. The square top of the pillar is brightly painted and carries [[sundial]]s on its sides.
It was erected by [[Lady Anne Clifford]] in 1656 to mark the place where she said goodbye for the last time to her mother, [[Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/countess-pillar-brougham/history-and-research/ The history of the Countess Pillar], English Heritage&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Jean Wilson, &amp;quot;The Countess&amp;apos; Pillar, Westmoreland&amp;quot;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;History Today&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Vol. 48, July 1998&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Anne Clifford, countess of Pembroke, Dorset and Montgomery (1590-1676), spent much of her life in a long and complex legal battle to obtain the rights of her inheritance. Her mother was one of the few people who supported Anne&amp;apos;s claim to the family estates.  In 1616 Anne travelled north to see &amp;apos;her&amp;apos; estates and visit her mother at [[Brougham Castle]]. On her departure from the castle, Anne travelled with her mother a quarter of a mile to where the castle drive meets the main road, where they had &amp;quot;a grievous and heavy parting&amp;quot;. Margaret died a month later. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/people-and-places/womens-history/anne-clifford/ Lady Anne Clifford&amp;apos;s story], English Heritage&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
The inscription on the pillar describes Anne as &amp;quot;Sole Heire&amp;quot; of her father [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland|George Earl of Cumberland]]&amp;quot;.  It also refers to a bequest in memory of Margaret which was made to the poor of the parish of Brougham.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.visitcumbria.com/pen/countess-pillar/ Countess Pillar page on Visit Cumbria]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
