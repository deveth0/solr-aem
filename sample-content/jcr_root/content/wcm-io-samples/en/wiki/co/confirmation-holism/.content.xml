        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Confirmation holism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;epistemological holism&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is attributed to [[Willard van Orman Quine]]&amp;apos;s extension of [[Pierre Duhem]]&amp;apos;s problem of [[underdetermination]] as to physical theory, Quine&amp;apos;s extension of underdetermination to all knowledge claims, since no [[theory]] of any type can be tested in isolation, but only embedded on a background of innumerable and often undetermined factors.  (See [[Quine-Duhem thesis]].)  Confirmation holism thus involves the problem of credit assignment, determining which aspect of the overall network to attribute a theory&amp;apos;s failure to.  And by ontological relativity, explicated by Quine, one can always protect one&amp;apos;s explanation of phenomena by attributing failure to some aspect outside the explanation.

==Underdetermination in physical theory==

By 1845 astronomers found that the orbit of planet [[Uranus]] around the Sun departed from expectations.  Not concluding that [[Newton&amp;apos;s law of universal gravitation]] was flawed, however, astronomers [[John Couch Adams]] as well as [[Urbain Le Verrier]] independently predicted a new planet, calculated its weight and orbit through Newton&amp;apos;s theory, and so was discovered the planet [[Neptune]] where predicted.  And yet neither did this empirical success of Newton&amp;apos;s theory verify Newton&amp;apos;s theory.

Le Verrier soon reported that Mercury&amp;apos;s [[perihelion]]—the peak of its orbital ellipse nearest to the Sun—advanced each time Mercury completed an orbit, a phenomenon not predicted by Newton&amp;apos;s theory, which astrophysicists were so confident in that they predicted a new planet, named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Vulcan (hypothetical planet)|Vulcan]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which a number of astronomers subsequently claimed to have seen.  In 1905, however, Einstein&amp;apos;s [[special theory of relativity]] claimed that space and time are both [[spacetime|relative]], refuting the very framework of Newton&amp;apos;s theory that claimed that space and time were both [[absolute space and time|absolute]].

In 1915, Einstein&amp;apos;s [[general theory of relativity]] newly explained [[gravitation]] while precisely predicting Mercury&amp;apos;s orbit.  In 1919, astrophysicist [[Arthur Eddington]] led an expedition to test Einstein&amp;apos;s prediction of the Sun&amp;apos;s mass reshaping [[spacetime]] in its vicinity.  The [[Royal Society of London|Royal Society]] announced confirmation—accepted by physicists as the fall of Newton&amp;apos;s theory.  Yet few [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]] believe general relativity a fundamentally accurate description of gravitation, and instead seek a theory of [[quantum gravity]].
