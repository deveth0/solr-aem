&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gladys Staines&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born c. 1951) is the widow of [[Australia]]n [[missionary]] [[Graham Staines]].  Graham Staines was burnt alive along with their two sons Philip (aged 9) and Timothy (aged 7) in [[Odisha]], [[India]] on 22 January 1999.

Shortly after the sentencing of the killers, Staines issued a statement saying that she had forgiven the killers and had no bitterness towards them.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2003/09/23/stories/2003092305471200.htm &amp;quot;I have forgiven them&amp;quot;: Gladys Staines]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 2004, she decided to return to Australia to stay with her daughter and father. She however said that she would continue to look after the people she and her husband had been looking after so far.

In 2005, she was awarded the [[Padma Shri]], a civilian award from the [[Government of India]], which drew negative protests from many people in the country. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
