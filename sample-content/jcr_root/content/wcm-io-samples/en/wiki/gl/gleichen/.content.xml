&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gleichen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the name of two groups of castles in [[Germany]], thus named from their resemblance to each other ({{lang-de|gleich {{=}} like, or resembling}}).

== Castles in Thuringia between Gotha and Erfurt ==
The first is a group of three (hence called “die drei [three] Gleichen”), each situated on a hill in [[Thuringia]] between [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]] and [[Erfurt]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;
The [[:de:Drei Gleichen|German Wikipedia article]] reports that the three castles do not look alike.  The legend of the resemblance of the three is said to stem from an onslaught of [[ball lightning]] on May 31, 1231, when the three shone like identical torches.
&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
One of these called Gleichen, the [[Wandersleben]]er Gleiche (1221&amp;amp;nbsp;ft. above the sea), was besieged unsuccessfully by the emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] in 1088. It was the seat of a line of counts, one of whom, Ernest III, a crusader, is the subject of a romantic legend. Having been captured, he was released from his imprisonment by a [[Turkey|Turkish]] woman, who returned with him to Germany and became his wife, a papal dispensation allowing him to live with two wives at the same time (see Reineck, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Die Sage von der Doppelehe eines Grafen von Gleichen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1891). After belonging to the elector of [[Mainz]] the castle became the property of [[Prussia]] in 1803. The second castle is called Mühlburg (1309&amp;amp;nbsp;ft. above the sea). This existed as early as 704 and was besieged by Henry IV in 1087. It came into the hands of Prussia in 1803. The third castle, [[Wachsenburg Castle|Wachsenburg]] (1358&amp;amp;nbsp;ft.), was still inhabited in 1911 and contained a collection of weapons and pictures belonging to its owner, the duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, whose family obtained possession of it in 1368. It was built about 935 (see Beyer, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Die drei Gleichen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Erfurt, 1898).

== Castles near Göttingen ==
The other group consists of two castles, Neuen-Gleichen and Alten-Gleichen. The former is in ruins, while the latter is barely discernable under the forest cover. They crown two hills south-east of [[Göttingen]], over [[Bremke]].

== The name of Gleichen ==
The name of Gleichen is taken by the family descended from [[Prince Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]] through his marriage with [[Princess Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg|Laura Wilhelmina Seymour]], sister of the [[Francis Seymour, 5th Marquess of Hertford|5th Marquess of Hertford]] and daughter of Admiral Sir [[George Francis Seymour]], a branch of the Hohenlohe family having at one time owned part of the county of Gleichen.
