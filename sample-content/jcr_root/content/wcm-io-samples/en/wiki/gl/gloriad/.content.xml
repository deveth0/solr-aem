India, Singapore, Vietnam, and Egypt were added in 2009.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;livescience&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=High-Speed Other Internet goes Global |publisher=LiveScience.com | url=http://www.livescience.com/technology/091015-global-gloraid-taj-cyber-net.html | date = 15 October 2009 | accessdate = 16 October 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

GLORIAD is sponsored by the US [[National Science Foundation]], a consortium of science organizations and Ministries in Russia, the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], the Ministry of Science and Technology of Korea, the Canadian [[CANARIE]] network, the national research network in The Netherlands [[SURFnet]] and has some telecommunications services donated by [[Tyco Telecommunications]].

GLORIAD provides [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of up to 10 Gbit/s via [[OC-192]] links, e.g. between [[KRLight]] in Korea and the [[Pacific NorthWest GigaPOP]] in the United States.

The previous version of the network, &amp;quot;Little GLORIAD&amp;quot;, was completed in mid-2004, and it connected [[Chicago]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Beijing]], [[Novosibirsk]], [[Moscow]], [[Amsterdam]] and Chicago again. For this network, a direct computer link was drawn between Russia and China for the first time in history.
