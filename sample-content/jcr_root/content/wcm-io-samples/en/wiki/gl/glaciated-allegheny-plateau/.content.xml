[[Wisconsin glaciation|Glaciation]] in this area of the plateau removed the sharp relief that is seen in unglaciated areas of the plateau. The line of the distant peaks approximates the level of a [[peneplain]] that was uplifted to form the plateau.]]

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Glaciated Allegheny Plateau&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is that portion of the [[Allegheny Plateau]] that lies within the area covered by the last [[glaciation]].  As a result, this area of the Allegheny Plateau has lower relief and more gentle slopes than the relatively rugged [[Unglaciated Allegheny Plateau]].  In general, the glaciated lies to the north and west of the unglaciated, and forms an arc in northeastern to southeastern [[Ohio]] lying between the [[Glacial till plains (Ohio)|glacial till plains]] and the Unglaciated Allegheny Plateau. The Glaciated Allegheny Plateau extends into a belt of southern [[New York| New York state]] and the central [[Susquehanna River]] basin.

A small area of the Allegheny Plateau was glaciated during the [[Last glacial period|Wisconsin Stage]], the late [[Illinoian (stage)|Illinoian Stage]], and Pre-Illinoian B and G glaciations of the [[Pre-Illinoian|Pre-Illinoian Stage]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;RichmondOther1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Richmond, G.M. and D.S.

The major cities on the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau are [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] and [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]].
