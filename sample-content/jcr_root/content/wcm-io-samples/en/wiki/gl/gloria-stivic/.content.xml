&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gloria Stivic&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (née &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bunker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), is a [[supporting character]] played by [[Sally Struthers]] on the American [[situation comedy]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[All in the Family]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which aired on the [[CBS]] [[television network]] from 1971 until 1979. She was the only child of [[Archie Bunker|Archie]] and [[Edith Bunker]], and she was married to [[Michael Stivic]]. She was born 11 months after Edith and Archie were married as stated in the episode The Longest Kiss Season 5, Episode 10.

Gloria was often caught in the middle of arguments between her husband Michael, with whom she shared liberal political beliefs, and her conservative father, Archie.

Gloria&amp;apos;s mother mentioned (in the pilot) that Gloria was [[anemic]] and was therefore overprotected as a child.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Adler|first=Richard|title=All in the Family: A Critical Appraisal|publisher=Praeger|year=1979|pages=17|accessdate=2008-10-10}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Gloria was the main breadwinner for the couple during the first five years of their marriage while they lived in her parents&amp;apos; home.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Sagert|first= Kelly Boyer|title=The 1970s|location=Westport, Conn.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007|pages=194|isbn=0-313-33919-8, 9780313339196|accessdate=2008-10-10}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;robinson&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; With Michael attending college, initially for his bachelor&amp;apos;s degree, then continuing for his master&amp;apos;s, Gloria worked full-time at a department store.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;robinson&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Lillian S.|title=Sex, Class, Culture|publisher=Routledge|location=New York and London|year=1986| pages=315|isbn=0-416-01241-8, 9780416012415|accessdate=2008-10-10}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; She was sensitive about having only a high school education.

Gloria and Mike moved to a rental house owned by former Bunker neighbor [[George Jefferson]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=McCrohan|first=Donna|title=Archie &amp;amp; Edith, Mike &amp;amp; Gloria: The Tumultuous History of All in the Family|publisher=Workman Pub.|year=1987|pages=178|isbn=0-89480-527-4, 9780894805271|accessdate=2008-10-10|location=New York}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; At that time Gloria became pregnant. She then had a boy, [[Joey Stivic]], and became a stay-at-home mother, while Michael began his teaching career. The Stivics later moved to [[Santa Barbara, California]] after Michael was offered an associate professor&amp;apos;s position at a university.

The Stivic marriage was tested after Gloria engaged in an affair with Bud Kreeger, a college faculty colleague of her husband. Gloria confessed this affair to her parents, while remaining silent about sleeping with him, during Archie and Edith&amp;apos;s Christmas visit to California.

Michael would later get arrested for a nude protest at a nuclear power plant, and would eventually abandon his family to join a [[commune]] with one of his college students.

Struthers continued playing the character of Gloria Bunker in guest appearances on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Archie Bunker&amp;apos;s Place]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and on the 1982–1983 related series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Gloria (TV series)|Gloria]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in which she was divorced from her husband Michael, and working in a [[veterinarian]]&amp;apos;s office in upstate New York.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=McNeil|first= Alex|title=Total Television: The Comprehensive Guide to Programming from 1948 to the Present|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|year=1986|isbn=0-14-024916-8, 9780140249163|accessdate=2008-10-10}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
