&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gladys Rosa Zender de Meier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[married and maiden names#Spanish-speaking_world|née]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zender Urbina&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;;  born October 19, 1938) is a [[beauty queen]] from [[Peru]] who became the first [[Latin America]]n woman to win the [[Miss Universe]] title.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;montreal&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

==Miss Universe==
Born to a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] father and a Peruvian mother, she obtained the title of [[Miss Universe 1957]] in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[California]], [[United States]].

After being crowned, it was revealed that she was only 17 years old, a few months under the contest&amp;apos;s minimum age requirement. Pageant officials decided that she could keep the crown, after they were told she was considered to be 18 in Peru.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;montreal&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  That same year, [[Miss USA]], [[Mary Leona Gage]], was stripped of her title and disqualified from the semifinals of the Miss Universe pageant after it was revealed she was a married mother of two children. Miss Argentina, Mónica Lamas, replaced her as one of the 15 semifinalists.

==Return to Peru==
Zender became an instant celebrity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

*She flew on the inaugural flight from [[JFK International Airport|Idlewild International Airport]] in [[New York City]], [[New York]], to [[Jorge Chavez International Airport]] in [[Lima]], Peru, where she was greeted by thousands of fans.
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Caretas]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, one of Peru&amp;apos;s most-popular [[newsmagazine]]s, soon featured Zender on their cover. She was also later featured on that publication&amp;apos;s first all-color cover.
*The Peruvian composer Alicia Maguina created a song called &amp;quot;Polka a Gladys Zender&amp;quot; (Polka dedicated to Gladys Zender). It was also titled &amp;quot;La más hermosa&amp;quot; (The most beautiful) and was recorded by the Peruvian group [[Los Troveros Criollos]].

==Personal life==
Zender married Antonio Meier in 1965, and secluded herself into a family life; they had four children together. Their son, [[Christian Meier]], is a well-known actor and singer in Peru and has achieved some fame in other Latin American countries.

In 2003, Zender allowed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Caretas&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to photograph her (and Meier&amp;apos;s) home showcasing various artifacts, including a collection of [[Inca]]n art, the couple have acquired through their years together.
