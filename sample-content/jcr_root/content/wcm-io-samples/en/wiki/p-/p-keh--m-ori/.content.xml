        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pākehā Māori&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were the early [[Europe]]an [[settler]]s in [[New Zealand]] (known as [[Pākehā]] in the [[Māori language]]) who lived among the [[Māori people|Māori]].

Some were kept by the Māori as [[Slavery|slaves]], while others settled in Māori communities by choice, many being runaway seamen or escaped convicts.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/cultural-go-betweens/2 &amp;quot;Cultural go-betweens, Pākehā–Māori&amp;quot;], Te Ara&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;They were often welcomed, took wives and were treated as Māori, particularly in the first two decades of the 19th century. The rarity value of Europeans in New Zealand and the importance of trade in Western goods - particularly muskets - made Pākehā Māori highly prized for their trading skills. Some achieved a degree of prestige among the Māori and fought in battle with their adopted tribe in the [[New Zealand land wars]], sometimes against European soldiers. While some lived the rest of their lives amongst Māori, others, such as lapsed missionary [[Thomas Kendall]], found it convenient to only briefly &amp;quot;go native.&amp;quot;

A few Pākehā Māori such as John Rutherford&amp;lt;ref name=railways&amp;gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Gov13_08Rail-t1-body-d7.html &amp;quot;John Rutherford — The “White New Zealander”&amp;quot;], A.J. Waldie&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and [[Barnet Burns]] even received the [[Tā moko|moko]] or facial tattoo.

As more Europeans arrived, the status of early Europeans among Māori fell and some of the early Pakeha Maori reverted to a more European existence.

The early settler [[Frederick Edward Maning]] published two books under the pseudonym &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pakeha Māori&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which contain many examples of how Pakeha/Maori lived.
