&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pâté chinois&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-fr|pɑte ʃinwa|pron}}) is a French Canadian dish similar to [[England|English]] [[cottage pie]] or [[shepherd&amp;apos;s pie]], or [[France|French]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[hachis Parmentier]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It is made from layered [[ground beef]] (sometimes mixed with [[Sautéeing|sautéed]] [[dicing|diced]] [[onion]]s) on the bottom layer, [[canning|canned]] [[maize|corn]] (either whole-kernel, [[creamed corn|creamed]], or a mix) for the middle layer, and [[mashed potato]]es on top. Variations may include sprinkling [[paprika]] on top of the potatoes, reversing the layering of ingredients, adding diced [[bell pepper]]s to the ground beef, and serving the dish with [[pickling|pickled]] [[Egg (food)|egg]]s or [[beet]]s. Pâté chinois (French for &amp;quot;Chinese pie&amp;quot;) is often consumed with [[ketchup]] mixed in.

==Name origins==

Pâté Chinois is not a Chinese [[recipe]]. It may simply be an adaption of &amp;quot;Shepherd&amp;apos;s Pie&amp;quot;, but one possible explanation for the Chinese reference is that it was introduced to Canadian railway workers by Chinese cooks during the building of the North American railroads in the late 19th century.{{Fact|date=March 2009}} These cooks made it under instruction from the [[railway]] bosses (of English extraction) as an easily-prepared, inexpensive version of the popular [[cottage pie]], with the sauce in the tinned creamed-corn serving as a substitute for the [[gravy]].

The French Canadian railway workers became fond of it and brought the recipe back with them to their home communities. From there, it was brought to the [[textile mill]] communities of [[Maine]] ([[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]]), [[New Hampshire]] ([[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]]), [[Massachusetts]] (e.g., [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] and [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]]) and [[Rhode Island]] ([[Woonsocket, Rhode Island|Woonsocket]]) where many French Canadians immigrated to work in the mills during the early 20th century. It may also be connected to the town of China, Maine.
Some Lewiston, Maine families made a variation called Pâté au Chinois layering the dish with mashed potatoes at the bottom, ground beef next, followed by peas, whole beets, and creamed corn on the top.

==Cultural references==
In the [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] humorous [[television program]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[La Petite Vie]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, pâté chinois is used to show one of the character&amp;apos;s abysmal lack of [[common sense]] as she regularly fails to properly prepare it, for example, by laying the three [[ingredient]]s side by side instead of layering them, or forgetting to mash the potatoes.
