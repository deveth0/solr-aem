[[File:Agénor Bardoux.jpg|thumb|Agénor Bardoux &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; (unknown photographer, unknown date, probably before 1880).]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Agénor Bardoux&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Bourges]], [[Cher (department)|Cher]], 15 January 1829 &amp;amp;ndash; [[Paris]], 23 November 1897) was a [[France|French]] [[wikt:statesman|statesman]] and [[republicanism|republican]], son of Jacques Bardoux ([[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]], 3 February 1795 - [[Clermont-Ferrand]], 8 January 1871) and wife Thérèse Pignet ([[Limoges]], 6 April 1807 - [[St. Saturnin]], 25 March 1883).

A native of [[Bourges]], he was established as an [[advocate]] in [[Clermont-Ferrand]], and did not hesitate to proclaim his Republican sympathies. In 1871 he was elected deputy of the [[French National Assembly]], and re-elected in 1876 and in 1877. In the chamber he was president of the group of the [[centre-left]], standing strongly for the republic but against [[anti-clericalism]]. In the republican chamber elected after May 16, 1877, he became [[Minister of National Education (France)|minister of public instruction]] (December 1877), and proposed various republican laws, notably on compulsory primary education. He resigned in 1879. He was not re-elected in 1881, but in December 1882 was named [[senator for life]].

Married in [[Montpellier]] on 15 July 1873 Clémence Villa ([[Millau]], 26 December 1847 - [[Paris]], 2 December 1939), daughter of Achille Villa ([[Millau]], 17 April 1818 - [[Millau]], 7 April 1901) and wife Sophie Bimar ([[Montpellier]], 13 October 1824 - [[Montpellier]], 6 February 1885), by whom he had at least one son, the French senator and academic [[Jacques Bardoux|Achille Octave Marie Jacques Bardoux]]. One of his descendants, [[Valéry Giscard d&amp;apos;Estaing]] (born 1926) was [[president of France]] from 1974 until 1981.
