&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Agoli-agbo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is considered to have been the twelfth and final King of [[Dahomey]].  He took the throne after the previous king, [[Behanzin]], went into exile after a failed war with [[France]].  He was in power from 1894 to 1900.

The exile of Behanzin did not legalize the French colonization. The French general [[Alfred Dodds]] offered the throne to every one of the immediate royal family, in return for a signature on a treaty establishing a French protectorate over the [[Kingdom (politics)|Kingdom]]; all refused. Finally, Behanzin&amp;apos;s Army Chief of Staff Prince Agoli-agbo, brother of Behanzin and son of King Glélé. He was appointed to the throne, as a &amp;apos;traditional chief&amp;apos; rather than head of state of a sovereign nation, by the French when he agreed to sign the instrument of surrender. He &amp;apos;reigned&amp;apos; for only six years, assisted by a French [[Viceroy]]. The French prepared for direct administration, which they achieved on February 12, 1900. Agoli-agbo went into exile in [[Gabon]]. In 1910, he was allowed to return and to live in the Save-Region. He occasionally returned to Abomey in order to perform ancestor worship for the departed kings.

Agoli-agbo&amp;apos;s symbols are a leg kicking a rock, a bow (a symbol of the return to traditional weapons under the new rules established by the colonial administrators), and a broom.
