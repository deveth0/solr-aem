&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hiero II&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (c. 308 BC – 215 BC) was the [[Greeks|Greek]] Sicilian king of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] from 270 to 215 BC, and the illegitimate son of a Syracusan noble, [[Hierocles of Syracuse|Hierocles]], who claimed descent from [[Gelo]]n. He was a former general of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] and an important figure of the [[First Punic War]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+1.8 &amp;quot;The Rise of Hiero&amp;quot; from Polybius, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Histories&amp;apos;&amp;apos; at Perseus]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
==Punic War==
[[File:Syracuse Philistis Tetradrachm 218 BC 80000114.jpg|thumb|right|Image of [[Philistis]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;(left)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the wife of Hiero II, from a coin.]]
On the departure of Pyrrhus from [[Sicily]] (275 BC) the Syracusan army and citizens appointed him commander of the troops. He strengthened his position by marrying the daughter of Leptines, the leading citizen. In the meantime, the [[Mamertines]], a body of [[Campania]]n mercenaries who had been employed by [[Agathocles]], had seized the stronghold of [[Messana]], and proceeded in harassing the Syracusans. They were finally defeated in a pitched battle near [[Mylae]] by Hiero, who was only prevented from capturing Messana by [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] interference. His grateful countrymen then made him [[king]] (270).

In 264 BC he again returned to the attack, and the Mamertines called in the aid of [[Rome]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+1.16 &amp;quot;Hiero and Rome&amp;quot; from Polybius, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Histories&amp;apos;&amp;apos; at Perseus]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Hiero at once joined the Punic leader [[Hanno]], who had recently landed in Sicily; but fighting a battle to an inconclusive outcome with the Romans led by the [[consul]] [[Claudius Caudex|Appius Claudius Caudex]], he withdrew to Syracuse.&amp;lt;ref name = &amp;quot;8-16&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==As King of Syracuse==
Pressed by the Roman forces, in 263 he concluded a treaty with Rome, by which he was to rule over the south-east of Sicily and the eastern coast as far as [[Tauromenium]].&amp;lt;ref name = &amp;quot;8-16&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[[Polybius]] i. 8-16; [[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]] Viii. 9&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

From this time until his death in 215 BC he remained loyal to the Romans, and frequently assisted them with men and provisions during the Punic war.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Livy]] xxi. 49-51, xxii. 37, xxiii. 21&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He kept up a powerful fleet for defensive purposes, and employed his famous kinsman [[Archimedes]] in the construction of those engines that, at a later date, played so important a part during the siege of Syracuse by the Romans.

According to a story told by [[Vitruvius]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[De architectura]] IX.9...12&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Hiero suspected he was being cheated by the goldsmith to whom he had supplied the gold to make a [[votive crown]] for a temple. He asked Archimedes to find out if all the gold had been used, as had been agreed. Archimedes, on discovering the principle of [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]] needed to measure the [[density]] of the crown is said to have shouted &amp;quot;[[Eureka (word)|eureka, eureka!&amp;quot;]] while running naked through Syracuse. Vitruvius concludes this story by stating that Archimedes&amp;apos; method successfully detected the goldsmith&amp;apos;s fraud; he had taken some of the gold and substituted silver instead.
==Legacy and honors==
A picture of the prosperity of Syracuse during his rule is given in the sixteenth idyll of [[Theocritus]], his favourite poet.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Diodorus Siculus|Diod. Sic.]] xxii. 24-xxvi. 24; Polybius i. 8-vu. 7; [[Junianus Justinus|Justin]] xxiii. 4.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Prince]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (VI), [[Machiavelli]] cites Hiero as an exceptionally virtuous man and a rare example of someone who rose to princehood from private station, comparing him to [[Moses]], [[Cyrus]], [[Theseus]],and [[Romulus]].
