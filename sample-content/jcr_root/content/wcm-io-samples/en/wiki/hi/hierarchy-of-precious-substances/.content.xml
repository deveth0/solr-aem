In [[popular culture]], sets of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;precious substances&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; may form &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hierarchies&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which express conventional perceived relative [[Value theory|value]] or [[:wikt:merit|merit]]. [[Precious metal]]s appear prominently in such [[hierarchies]], but as they grow, [[gemstone|gem]]s and semi-precious materials may be introduced as part of the system. The sequences can provide interesting examples of the arbitrariness of [[sign (semiotics)|semiotic signs]].

==Traditional manifestations==
[[Jubilee#Anniversaries and celebrations|Jubilee]]s have a [[hierarchy]] of years: [[Silver Jubilee|silver]] (25), [[Golden Jubilee|golden]] (50) followed by [[Diamond Jubilee|diamond]] (60), and [[Platinum Jubilee|platinum]] (70 or 75).

[[Wedding anniversary|Wedding anniversaries]] extend the jubilee hierarchy with various sequences of substances filling in many of the gaps between the major milestones: bronze (8 years) – silver (25 years) – pearl (30) – ruby (40) – gold (50) – diamond (60) – diamond &amp;amp; gold (75).

[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] mythic-cultural [[cosmology]] depicted a decline from a [[golden age]] to a [[silver age]] followed by an [[Ages of Man|Iron Age]]. This is even more intense in the Indian Vedic system, where the four ages: Gold, Silver, Bronze, Iron, come with defining characteristics. We are currently in an Iron Age, which will eventually give way to a returning Golden Age.

==Modern adaptations==
The measurement of sales of [[popular music]] starts high relative to the wedding anniversary scale, concentrating on gold and platinum (see [[gold album]]).  Likewise, [[credit card]] companies usually have a &amp;quot;gold card&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;platinum card&amp;quot; (many formerly had a &amp;quot;silver card&amp;quot; then followed by a &amp;quot;gold card&amp;quot;, but due to similarity in appearance between silver and platinum these were often discontinued with the rise in popularity of platinum as a precious metal); [[Standard Chartered Bank]] has introduced a &amp;quot;titanium card&amp;quot; as a grade higher than platinum.

[[Sport]]s events have a well-established convention (introduced into the [[Olympic games|Olympic]] tradition at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]]), of a hierarchy of [[medal]]s: [[bronze medal]] - [[silver medal]] - [[gold medal]]. This presumably echoes conventional [[coin]]age systems, in which cheap bronze or [[copper]] denominations could aggregate to intermediate silver coins, then to gold [[money]]. The archetypal British designations ([[British one penny coin (pre-decimal)|penny]], [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] and [[Pound Sterling|pound]]) parallel and reflect this hierarchy.

Events-[[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] in [[sport]] or in the [[arts]] may involve (for example) silver, gold and/or platinum sponsors.
Titanium is considered as a semi-precious metal.
