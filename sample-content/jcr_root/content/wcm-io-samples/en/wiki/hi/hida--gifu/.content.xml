{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hida&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|飛騨市|Hida-shi}} is the northernmost city in [[Gifu Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. It received its name from the historical province of [[Hida Province]], which was centered around the same area.

The official &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[kanji]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for the city is actually 飛驒, which uses the old rendering of the 騨 character. However, the 驒 characters is not included on the official list of usable characters (as decided by the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications]]), so the 騨 character is often used outside of the city.

==History==
The city was established on February 1, 2004 by the merger of the towns of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Furukawa&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kamioka&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the villages of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kawai&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Miyagawa&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, all from [[Yoshiki District, Gifu|Yoshiki District]].

==Geography==
The city is located on the northern part of the Hida Plateau. The city is geographically divided into two areas, the eastern and western half. The [[Takahara River]] flows through the eastern half the city and the Miya River flows through the western half (both rivers are part of the [[Jinzū River]] river system). A mountainous region separates the two sides and the population generally clusters around the two river valleys.

Much of the area within the city&amp;apos;s borders is covered in forests. There are many mountains that reach higher than {{Convert|1000|ft|0|on}}, though some peaks in the [[Hida Mountains]] reach even higher, going beyond {{Convert|2000|ft|0|on}}.

==Economy==
The main two traditional economies in the city are the production of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[sake]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and [[Japanese candles]]. The Furukawa area of the city is known for both of these crafts, though the Kamioka section is also known for its &amp;apos;&amp;apos;sake&amp;apos;&amp;apos; production.

==Festival in Hida==
Furukawa Festival, a famous for festival in Gifu Prefecture, with this event held on every April.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
