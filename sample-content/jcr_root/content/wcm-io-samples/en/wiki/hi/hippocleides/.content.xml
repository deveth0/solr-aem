        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hippocleides&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Ἱπποκλείδης), the son of Teisander (Τείσανδρος), was an [[Athens|Athenian]] nobleman, who served as [[Archons of Athens|Eponymous Archon]] for the year 566 BC – 565 BC.

He was a member of the [[Philaidae]], a wealthy Athenian family which was opposed to the [[Peisistratus]] family. During his term as [[archon]] he set up the statue of [[Athena]] Promachos (πρὀμαχος) in Athens and oversaw a reorganization of the [[Panathenaia]] festival.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Terry Buckley, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aspects of Greek history, 750-323 BC: A Source-Based Approach&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Routledge, 1996), pp. 120-121.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

As a young man he competed for the hand of [[Agariste of Sicyon|Agariste]], the daughter of [[Cleisthenes of Sicyon|Cleisthenes]], the [[tyrant]] of [[Sicyon]]. By the end of the competitions, only Hippocleides and [[Megacles]] remained. According to [[Herodotus]] (6.129-130), Hippocleides became intoxicated during a dinner party with Cleisthenes, and began to act like a fool; at one point he stood on his head and kicked his legs in the air, keeping time with the flute music. When Hippocleides was informed by Cleisthenes &amp;quot;Oh son of Teisander, you have just danced away your marriage,&amp;quot; his response was &amp;quot;οὐ φροντὶς Ἱπποκλείδῃ&amp;quot;, (&amp;quot;[[Zamanfou|Hippocleides doesn&amp;apos;t care]]&amp;quot; or literally &amp;quot;No care for Hippocleides&amp;quot;). The phrase, according to Herodotus, became a common expression in the [[Greece|Greek]] world.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Herodotus, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ed. [[Aubrey de Sélincourt]] ([[Penguin Books]], 1954; rev. ed. John Marincola, 1996), pp. 406-407.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The phrase was well-known to later authors; [[Aristophanes]] paraphrases it in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Wasps]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Aristophanes, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Wasps&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, trans. [[Moses Hadas]], in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Complete Plays of Aristophanes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ed. Moses Hadas (Bantam Books, 1962), pg. 209. Line 1410.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and [[Plutarch]], who disliked Herodotus, says the author &amp;quot;would dance away the truth&amp;quot; like Hippocleides.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Plutarch, &amp;quot;Of Herodotus&amp;apos; Malice&amp;quot;, in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Plutarch&amp;apos;s Lives]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, vol. 4, ed. William W. Goodwin (Boston, 1874), pg. 356.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

[[T. E. Lawrence]] also had the phrase &amp;quot;ου φροντις&amp;quot; inscribed on his doorway.
