==History==

Hino District has been settled since ancient times. The area is especially rich in remains from the late [[Kofun period]] (250 &amp;amp;ndash; 538) AD. Hino District belonged to [[Hōki Province]], a former [[old provinces of Japan|old province]] of [[Japan]] that covered the western part of present-day Tottori Prefecture. The district is described in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Izumo Fudoki]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a detailed 8th-century record of the culture and geography of [[Izumo Province]]. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wamyō Ruijushō]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a 10th-century [[Japanese dictionary]], records that the district consisted of six villages by the time of the [[Heian period]] (794 &amp;amp;ndash; 1185). From the middle of the [[Kamakura period]] to the end of the [[Nanboku-chō period]], from roughly the 13th to 14th centuries, the district was controlled by the [[Hino clan|Hino]] and [[Kamonamochi clan|Kamonamochi]] clans.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;kokushi&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;chimei&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

Various clans took control of the district in the [[Sengoku period]] (1467 &amp;amp;ndash; 1573), but the area was ultimately unified under the [[Ikeda clan]], who ruled from [[Tottori Castle]] in present-day [[Tottori, Tottori|Tottori City]]. At the beginning of the [[Edo period]] (1603 &amp;amp;ndash; 1868) the district had 173 villages; by the end of the period, they numbered 165. Hino District was noted for the production of [[iron]], [[steel]], and [[tobacco]] in the Edo period. In 1858 Hino was separated into two districts, but records from the period indicate the borders of the area were, in general, poorly defined. Under the administrative reforms of the [[Meiji period]] (1868 &amp;amp;ndash; 1912) Hino District was re-established, and in 1889 consisted of 29 villages. Through various mergers the district now consists of only three municipalities.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;kokushi&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;chimei&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
