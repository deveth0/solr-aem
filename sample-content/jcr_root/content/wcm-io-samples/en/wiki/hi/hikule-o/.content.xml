        text="&lt;p&gt;In the [[Tongan mythology|mythology]] of [[Tonga]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Havea Hikule{{okina}}o&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the god of the [[world]], [[Pulotu]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The [[Samoa|Sāmoan]] equivalent is Savea Si{{okina}}uleo.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The islands of [[Kao (island)|Kao]], [[Tofua]], [[Hunga Ha&amp;apos;apai|Hunga Ha{{okina}}apai]], [[Hunga Tonga]], [[Late (Island)|Late]] and [[Fonualei (volcano)|Fonualei]] came from [[Rock (geology)|stone]]s thrown down from the skies by Hikule{{okina}}o. They are all volcanic islands.  The other, (coral) islands were fished up by his brother or cousin [[Maui (Tongan mythology)|Maui]].

Hikule{{okina}}o&amp;apos;s ancestors were, according to one source, the god Pil&amp;apos;e ([[Limu (Tongan mythology)|Limu]] according to others) and the goddess Kele, who came from Pulotu and created the mythical land of Tongamama{{okina}}o for their children to dwell in. They had a son Toiukamea (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hidden iron&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and a daughter Mā{{okina}}imoa{{okina}}alōngona (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;royal game of hearing&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) who married each other and had children.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;This pair seems to be a modern invention, since &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ukamea&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (iron) is a modern word that postdates European contact; in fact other informants leave out this generation.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Among their children were many sons&amp;apos;, the boy Taufulifonua and the girl Havea Lolofonua. One day they lay on the beach, naked, as they were still innocent, with their legs in the sea. The tide rose and the water covered them more and more. Then an o{{okina}}o (meaning: to penetrate) fish swam along and started to suck from the girl&amp;apos;s labia, which caused her a lot of joy. Once the fish had been chased away the boy tried to gently stroke her inflicted parts but that did not give her relief. Then instead of his hand, he tried it with his penis, and suddenly the girl was consoled. So copulation was invented, and Havea Hikule{{okina}}o was the first of many children.

Meanwhile Taufulifonua and Havea Lolofonua&amp;apos;s younger brother and sister, also twins, also married each other. They were named Fonu{{okina}}uta (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;land turtle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and Fonutahi (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;sea turtle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and their child was [[Maui (Tongan mythology)|Maui]] (Maui Motu{{okina}}a, that is; if he was not the child of Taufulifonua and Havea Lolofonua themselves). And the next younger brother and sister, also twins who married each other, were Velesi{{okina}}i (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;small enticer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and Velelahi (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;big enticer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), who brought forth [[Tangaloa (Tongan mythology)|Tangaloa]] (Tangaloa {{okina}}Eiki, that is).

When Taufulifonua had become old and close to death, he divided the universe: Tangaloa got the sky to rule, Maui the earth, and Havea Hikule{{okina}}o became the lord of [[Pulotu]].

Tangaloa&amp;apos;s descendants would become later the (divine) [[Tu&amp;apos;i Tonga|Tu{{okina}}i Tonga]] starting with [[&amp;apos;Aho&amp;apos;eitu|{{okina}}Aho{{okina}}eitu]]. Maui&amp;apos;s line became the Tu{{okina}}i Talau, while Hikule{{okina}}o&amp;apos;s offspring was [[Lo&amp;apos;au|Lo{{okina}}au]], and the ancestry of the [[Tu&amp;apos;i Ha&amp;apos;atakalaua|Tu{{okina}}i Ha{{okina}}atakalaua]].

The historical interpretation of this triumvirate (Hikule{{okina}}o, Maui, Tangaloa) may be a struggle to liberate Tonga from the dominance of the [[Tu&amp;apos;i Pulotu|Tu{{okina}}i Pulotu]] empire in Fiji, after which the victors could divide the spoils. Or, in reality perhaps, those three were Sāmoans, which made Tonga part of the [[Tu&amp;apos;i Manu&amp;apos;a|Tu{{okina}}i Manu{{okina}}a]] empire.
