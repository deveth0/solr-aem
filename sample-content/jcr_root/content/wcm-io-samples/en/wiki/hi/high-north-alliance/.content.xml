        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;High North Alliance&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Norwegian; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;HÃ¸ge Nord Alliansen)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an umbrella organisation of several [[fishing]], [[whaling]] and [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] [[municipal]] councils. The organisation objectives are, it says, &amp;quot;to protect the rights of whalers, sealers and fishermen to harvest renewable resources in accordance with the principle of sustainable management.&amp;quot;

The alliance was founded in 1991 in response to calls from [[environmentalist]]s to prohibit completely commercial [[whaling]], and, from more radical groups, calls to prohibit the killing of [[marine mammal]]s for any purpose. The alliance is organised by a governing committee of six members, three from [[Norway]], and one each from the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]]. The alliance is funded by membership fees, and from grants from organisations such as the [[North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission]] and the Regional Development Committee for Northern Norway.

Activities of the Alliance include lobbying the largely sympathetic Norwegian government for increases in Norway&amp;apos;s whaling quota, promoting studies into methods of more humane whaling, lobbying the [[International Whaling Commission]] into relaxing the whaling moratorium, and responding to campaigns from anti-whaling groups such as the [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society]] and [[Greenpeace]].
