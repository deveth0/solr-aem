Evidence suggests that around 3,000 years ago successive waves of human migrants from [[Southeast Asia]] spread across the Western [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] populating its many small islands. The [[Marshall Islands]] were settled by [[Micronesia]]ns in the [[2nd millennium BC]]. Little is known of the islands&amp;apos; early history.  Early settlers traveled between the islands by canoe using traditional [[stick chart]]s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.inquirewithin.biz/history/american_pacific/oceania/orientation.htm The History of Mankind] by Professor Friedrich Ratzel, Book II, Section A, The Races of Oceania page 165, picture of a stick chart from the Marshall Islands. MacMillan and Co., published 1896.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Alonso de Salazar]] landed there in 1529. They were named by [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Krusenstern]], after [[England|English]] [[explorer]] [[John Marshall (British captain)|John Marshall]], who visited them together with [[Thomas Gilbert (captain)|Thomas Gilbert]] in 1788, in route from [[Botany Bay]] to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (two ships of the [[First Fleet]]). The Marshall Islands were claimed by Spain in 1874.

Following [[papal]] mediation and German compensation of $4.5 million, Spain recognized Germany&amp;apos;s claim in 1885, which established a [[protectorate]] and set up trading stations on the islands of [[Jaluit]] and [[Ebon Atoll|Ebon]] to carry out the flourishing [[copra]] (dried [[coconut]] meat) trade. Marshallese [[Iroij]] (high chiefs) continued to rule under indirect colonial German administration.

At the beginning of [[World War I]], [[Japan]] assumed control of the Marshall Islands. The Japanese headquarters was established at the German center of administration, [[Jaluit]]. On January 31, 1944 American forces landed on [[Kwajalein]] [[atoll]] and U.S. Marines and Army troops later took control of the islands from the Japanese on February 3, following intense fighting on Kwajalein and [[Enewetak Atoll|Enewetak]] atolls. In 1947, the United States, as the occupying power, entered into an agreement with the [[UN Security Council]] to administer much of [[Micronesia]], including the Marshall Islands, as the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]].

From 1946 to 1958, it served as the [[Pacific Proving Grounds]] for the United States, and was the site of 67 [[nuclear tests]] on various atolls. The world&amp;apos;s first [[hydrogen bomb]], codenamed &amp;quot;[[Ivy Mike|Mike]]&amp;quot;, was tested at the [[Enewetak]] atoll in the [[Marshall Islands]] on November 1 (local date) in 1952, by the United States.

A significant [[radar]] installation was constructed on [[Kwajalein]] atoll.

On May 1, 1979, in recognition of the evolving political status of the Marshall Islands, the United States recognized the constitution of the Marshall Islands and the establishment of the Government of the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]]. The constitution incorporates both American and British constitutional concepts.

There have been a number of local and national elections since the Republic of the Marshall Islands was founded. The United Democratic Party, running on a reform platform, won the 1999 parliamentary election, taking control of the presidency and cabinet.

The islands signed a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States in 1986. Trusteeship was ended under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 683]] of December 22, 1990. Until 1999 the islanders received US$180M for continued American use of Kwajalein atoll, US$250M in compensation for [[nuclear test]]ing, and US$600M in other payments under the compact.

Despite the constitution, the government was largely controlled by Iroij. It was not until 1999, following [[political corruption]] allegations, that the [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] government was overthrown, with [[Imata Kabua]] replaced by the &amp;apos;[[commoner]]&amp;apos; [[Kessai Note]].
