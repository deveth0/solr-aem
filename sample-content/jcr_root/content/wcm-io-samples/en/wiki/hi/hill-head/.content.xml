&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hill Head&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a residential area (or village) on the coast of the [[Solent]]. It is located south of [[Stubbington]], west of [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] and south east of [[Titchfield]], in the borough of [[Fareham (borough)|Fareham]], [[Hampshire]]. Hill Head is in the [[Gosport (UK Parliament constituency)|Gosport]] parliamentary constituency. Hill Head has a shingle beach with [[sailing]], [[windsurfing]], [[kitesurfing]] and [[fishing]] and being the most popular pastimes upon its shores. There is also a small harbour, located where the [[River Meon]] enters the Solent. It is next to [[Titchfield Haven National Nature Reserve]].

Hill Head has a substantial elderly population &amp;amp;ndash; 22.45% of its 7,121 residents are over 65, compared to an English average of 15.89%.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;census&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news

During [[World War II]], Hill Head was one of many loading zones for the [[D-Day]] invasions and the area was inundated with allied troops. Along the coast here there are still many reminders of the war time activities including remnants of [[fortifications]]. Part of a [[Mulberry harbour]] broke away and was grounded at Hill Head beach. It remained there for many years{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}.

Hill Head&amp;apos;s Salterns beach is one of the south coast&amp;apos;s leading venues for watersports including sailboarding and kitesurfing, and is the home of Seafarers Sailing Club. Just to the west is Hill Head Sailing Club.

The Swordfish [[public house]] at Hill Head was demolished in 2004 to make way for a small development of luxury million pound beach-front homes known as Swordfish Close. The name Swordfish is derived from the World War Two bomber the [[Fairey Swordfish]] which flew from the nearby airfield at [[RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus)]]. Swordfish Close has been featured in the popular [[BBC]] television series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Seaside Rescue&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The only remaining pub along Hill Head beach-front is The Osborne View, so named as [[Osborne House]] (residential home of HM Queen Victoria) is visible on a clear day.

Between 1985 and 1990, Hill Head&amp;apos;s beaches featured in the popular [[BBC]] TV show &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Howards&amp;apos; Way]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was mostly filmed at nearby [[Bursledon]], [[Hamble-le-Rice]], [[Warsash]] and [[Swanwick, Hampshire|Swanwick]].

Bus services to and from Hill Head are provided by First,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.firstgroup.com/ukbus/hampshire/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; with a half-hourly circular service to and from Fareham.
