&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xewkija Heliport&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gozo Heliport&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a small [[heliport]] on the island of [[Gozo]] in [[Malta]], near the town of [[Xewkija]]. It has two 22 meter wide helipads, connected by asphalt, to form a small 174 meter long [[runway]] in the 10/28 direction. There used to be scheduled helicopter flights between [[Malta International Airport]] and Xewkija Heliport. These were started by [[Malta Air Charter]] in 1990, which ceased to operate in 2004. From March 2005 until October 2006 the flights were done by [[HelicÃ³pteros del Sureste]]. Currently, no scheduled flights take place from the heliport. However, [[Heli Link Malta]] offers flights between the heliport and Malta on request.

It is being examined if the current short runway could be expanded to allow [[fixed wing aircraft]] [[STOL]] to land at Xewkija.
