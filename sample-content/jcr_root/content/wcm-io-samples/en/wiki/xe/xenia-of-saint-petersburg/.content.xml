&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Saint Blessed Xenia of [[St. Petersburg]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Святая блаженная Ксения Петербургская [&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xenia Grigoryevna Petrova&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - Ксения Григорьевна Петрова]; {{circa|1719–1730}} – {{c.|1803}}, Saint Petersburg) is a patron saint of St. Petersburg, who according to tradition, gave all her possessions to the poor after her husband died.

Her husband had been Colonel Andrey Fyodorovich Petrov, a chanter at the [[Saint Andrew Cathedral, Saint Petersburg|Saint Andrew Cathedral]]. After his death, Xenia became a &amp;quot;[[Yurodivy|fool-for-Christ]]&amp;quot; and for 45 years wandered around the streets of St. Petersburg, usually wearing her late husband&amp;apos;s military uniform.

St. Xenia&amp;apos;s grave is in the [[Smolensky Cemetery]] of St. Petersburg. It has been marked by an ornate chapel since 1902. She was canonized by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] on February 6, 1988.  Her feast day in the [[Julian calendar|O.S.]] is January 24, which is February 6 in the [[Gregorian Calendar|New Calendar]].

St. Blessed Mother Xenia is noted for her intercessions in helping those with employment, marriage, the homeless, for fires, for missing children, and for a spouse.(*http://www.serfes.org/lives/stxeniaofpetersburg.htm)

==Hymns==
[[Troparion]] (Tone 4)
:Having renounced the vanity of the earthly world,
:Thou didst take up the cross of a homeless life of wandering;
:Thou didst not fear grief, privation, nor the mockery of men,
:And didst know the love of Christ.
:Now taking sweet delight of this love in Heaven,
:O Xenia, the blessed and divinely wise,
:Pray for the salvation of our souls.

Troparion (Tone 8)
:In you, O mother was carefully preserved what is according to the image.
:For you took up the Cross and followed Christ.
:By so doing, you taught us to disregard the flesh for it passes away,
:But to care instead for the soul since it is immortal.
:Therefore, O Blessed Xenia, your spirit rejoices with the Angels.

[[Kontakion]] (Tone 7)
:Having loved the poverty of Christ,
:You are now being satisfied at the Immortal Banquet.
:By the humility of the Cross, you received the power of God.
:Having acquired the gift of miraculous help, O Blessed Xenia,
:Beseech Christ God, that by repentance
:We may be delivered from every evil thing.
