        text="&lt;p&gt;{{Cavalli operas}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xerse&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[opera]] by [[Francesco Cavalli]] - specifically, a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[dramma per musica]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; about [[Xerxes I]]. The [[libretto]] was written by [[Nicolò Minato]], and was later set by both [[Giovanni Battista Bononcini]] and [[George Frideric Handel]]. Minato&amp;apos;s plot outline is loosely based on Book 7 of [[Herodotus]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The opera, consisting of a prologue and three acts, was first performed at [[Venice]] on the 12 January of 1654, at the [[Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo|Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo]].

The opera was highly popular in Italy, not least due to Cavalli&amp;apos;s setting of &amp;quot;Ombra mai fù&amp;quot; (later more famously set by Handel): 9 different revivals were given across Italy while Cavalli lived. In 1660 Cavalli was persuaded to travel to France to produce a new opera for the wedding of [[Louis XIV]] in Paris. Unfortunately for the composer, he soon became entangled in court intrigue which ensured that the projected opera, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ercole amante]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was not ready in time and had to be replaced by a revival of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xerse&amp;apos;&amp;apos; at the last minute. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xerse&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was given with ballets by Cavalli&amp;apos;s rival [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], a [[Florence|Florentine]] who had become the official court composer in France. The whole spectacle lasted eight or nine hours and the French audience had little appreciation for an opera in a foreign language, preferring Lully&amp;apos;s dance music.
