&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xenusion auerswaldae&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an early [[arthropoda|arthropod]]/[[Velvet worm|onychophore]] known from two specimens found in glacial debris in Germany.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Dzik1989&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1502-3931.1989.tb01679.x}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; They probably originated in the Kalmarsund Sandstone of Southern [[Sweden]] (Jaeger and Martinsson 1966), which was deposited in the Lower Cambrian (Upper Tommotian–Lower Atdabanian; Stages 2→3).&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Han2008&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.gr.2007.09.001}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The specimens are not especially well preserved. The older specimen is 10&amp;amp;nbsp;cm or so in length with a narrow, weakly segmented body. A depression runs up the bottom on all but the rearmost segments. There is a slightly bulbous tail, and each segment beyond that seems to have a single pair of tapering annulated legs similar to the modern [[velvet worm|onychophore]], but without claws. Nine segments are present. There is a spine on each body bump and faint transverse parallel striations on the annulations on the legs. The legs of what is possibly the foremost segments are either missing or not preserved. The head is believed to be missing or is poorly preserved.  If &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xenusion&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[arthropoda|arthropod]]/[[velvet worm|onychophore]], it is one of the oldest currently known fossils of a mobile, modern animal.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xenusion&amp;apos;&amp;apos; has been reinterpreted as an [[Ediacaran biota|Ediacaran]] frond animal by Tarlo, and a drawing of that interpretation has been presented by McMenamin. Assuming that the creature is actually a lobopodian, the original specimen would appear to be part of an animal about 20&amp;amp;nbsp;cm in length.
In a photograph presented in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology|The Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Volume O, the organism&amp;apos;s appearance seems to support the original interpretation more.  Further studies of Xenusiid close the possibility of a Rangeomorphy affinity.
