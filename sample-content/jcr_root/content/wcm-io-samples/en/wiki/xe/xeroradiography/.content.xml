&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xeroradiography&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a type of [[x-ray]] in which a picture of the body is [[recorded]] on paper rather than on [[film]]. In this technique, a plate of selenium, which rests on a thin layer of aluminium oxide, is charged uniformly by passing it in front of a &amp;apos;[http://www.medcyclopaedia.com/library/topics/volume_i/s/scorotron.aspx scorotron]&amp;apos;.

As X-ray photon impinges on this amorphous coat of selenium, charges diffuse out, in proportion to energy content of the X-ray. This occurs as a result of [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/photoconduction photoconduction]. The resulting imprint, in the form of charge distribution on the plate, attracts toner particles, which is then transferred to reusable paper plates. In contrast to conventional X-rays, [[photographic developer]]s are not needed. Hence the term xeroradiography; &amp;apos;xero&amp;apos; meaning dry in Greek.
It requires more radiation exposure.
Its use is in mammography.

[[Xeromammography]] is a form of xeroradiography.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{MeshName|Xeromammography}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
