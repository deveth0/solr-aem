==Facilities==
{{tocright}}
Xenia Station was custom built in 1998 for the city of Xenia by a local contractor&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.matthewscontractor.com/commercial_projects.html David Metthews]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and is located on a {{convert|9|acre|m2|sing=on}} city park of the same name, which has play equipment, picnic tables, a picnic shelter,  nature areas, a [[caboose]] and off-street parking. The site is the former B&amp;amp;O freight yards. The building&amp;apos;s first floor houses a local history museum which includes  railroad memorabilia while the second floor has a classroom/meeting space. Xenia Station is also the hub for 5 regional [[rail trails]], two of which are segments of the unfinished Ohio to Erie Trail, which will run from Cincinnati to Cleveland. In addition to the museum and classroom/meeting space, the building also has restrooms, vending machines and water for the [[bicyclists]], [[hikers]] and others who use the park. It also has a large map of the rail trails and  the Hub Lookout, which is a tower accessible by spiral staircase that provides a panoramic view of the rail trails.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;miamivalleytrails.org&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;xenia.dreamhosters.com&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Railroad history==
As late as 1960, Xenia had 3 railroads running through it, as follows:
* The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&amp;amp;O]] [[Wellston, Ohio|Wellston]] subdivision, which ran between [[Washington Court House, Ohio|Washington Court House]] and [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]];
* The [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]&amp;apos;s Little Miami branch, between Cincinnati and [[Springfield, Ohio|Springfield]]: and
* The Pennsylvania Railroad&amp;apos;s [[Main Line (Pittsburgh to St. Louis)|Pittsburgh to St. Louis mainline]]. [[Amtrak]] used this line for the National Limited until 1979.

All 3 railroads were discontinued and dismantled by 1979 or shortly thereafter.

==Rail trails==
The crossing of these 3 railroad rights-of-way created 6 spokes on a wheel with Xenia Station in the center. Of these 6 spokes, 5 have been or are being converted to [[rail trail]]s.  The one exception was the B&amp;amp;O line west to Dayton which did not become a trail because it closely paralleled the Pennsylvania mainline to Dayton.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;miamivalleytrails.org&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Clockwise from the north, the 5 rails trails are:&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;miamivalleytrails.org&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

===Northeast===
The Prairie Grass Trail (a part of the  [[Ohio to Erie Trail]]) runs from Xenia to [[Cedarville, Ohio|Cedarville]] and to [[London, Ohio|London]] and beyond.

===East===
The Xenia-Jamestown Connector will run from Xenia to [[Jamestown, Ohio|Jamestown]] and beyond, but there is now a short gap from Xenia Station to Jasper Road.

===South===
The southern branch of the Little Miami Scenic Trail is a part of the  [[Ohio to Erie Trail]] and runs from Xenia to [[Milford, Ohio|Milford]] and beyond.
