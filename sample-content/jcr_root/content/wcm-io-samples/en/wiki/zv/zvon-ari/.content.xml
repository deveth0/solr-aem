&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zvončari&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the bellmen) is the characteristic folk custom maintained in the region around [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]. It was added to [[UNESCO]]&amp;apos;s [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] in 2009.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00011&amp;amp;RL=00243 UNESCO: Annual carnival bell ringers’ pageant from the Kastav area]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The custom dates to [[pagan]] antiquity, and remains typical for this region. The primary task of Zvončari is to scare away evil spirits of winter and to stir up new spring-time cycle. During the [[Rijeka Carnival]] time Zvončari march from village to village throughout the region, following the same centuries-old route, making an extraordinary amount of noise, fueled in part by the wine provided by the locals en route.

The standard Zvončar costume includes white trousers, striped shirt, and a sheepskin throw. In their hands they hold a &amp;quot;balta&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bačuka&amp;quot; - a stylized [[Ceremonial mace|mace]], and around the waist one or more big brass bells. The costume varies from village to village; for example, Zvončari of Halubje and [[Grobnik]] ([[Dondolaši]]) wear special stylized masks representing fantastic animal heads, while Zvončari of Žejane and Brgud wear &amp;quot;flower hats&amp;quot;.

A legend tells that Zvončari scared away invading [[Tatars]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turks]]. According to the legend the shepherds put masks on their heads, belted on bells, and produced a deafening noise that scared the enemy away. From that time on, a mace became  part of the standard equipment of Zvončari.

With their impressive appearance, Zvončari have become something of a tourist attraction, participating regularly in the international [[Rijeka Carnival]].
