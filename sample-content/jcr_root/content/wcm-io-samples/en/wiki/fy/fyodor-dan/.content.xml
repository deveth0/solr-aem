[[File:Fedor Dan.jpg|thumb|right|Dan in military doctor&amp;apos;s uniform.]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fyodor Ilyich Dan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ru|Фёдор Ильич Дан}}), often known in English as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fedor Dan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, (October 19, 1871 in [[Saint Petersburg]] &amp;amp;ndash; January 22, 1947 in [[New York]]) was one of the founding leaders of [[Menshevism]].

==Background==
Fyodor Dan was born to a [[Jewish]] family in St. Petersburg. His original surname was Gurvitch.

==Career==
Dan was a lifelong [[Communist]] activist.

===Russia===
While still a young man he joined the [[Union of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class]]. He was arrested in 1896 and exiled in [[Oryol]] for three years.

On his return he joined the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] and went to [[London]] for their Second Congress in 1903. Dan aligned himself with [[Julius Martov]] who wanted to have a larger party of activists, rather than [[Vladimir Lenin]]&amp;apos;s conception of a smaller party of professional revolutionaries. Dan helped Martov form the Mensheviks, returning to [[Russia]] in 1912.

Living in St Petersburg, he edited Menshevik publications until facing exile to [[Minusinsk]] following the outbreak of [[World War I]]. He was released in 1915 when he agreed to serve in the Army as a surgeon. He returned to St Petersburg following the [[February Revolution]] and argued for Menshevik involvement in the [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Provisional Government]]. He also argued for continuing the war against [[Germany]] and [[Austria]].

In 1917 he was the leading Menshevik on the praesidium of the [[Petrograd Soviet]]. He opposed the [[October Revolution]] and he was a member of the small oppositional group in the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]]. However this was banned in 1918. Dan continued to denounce the curtailment of political freedoms, linking [[Bolshevism]] with [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakuninism]].

===Exile===
Dan was arrested in 1921 and sent into exile. When the [[Soviet Union]] was attacked in 1941, Dan gave his support to the regime. In his book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Origins of Bolshevism&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1943) he argued that Bolshevism was the carrier of [[socialism]], whilst still arguing for political liberalisation in the Soviet Union.

==Death==
Dan died in [[New York City]] in the [[United States]].
