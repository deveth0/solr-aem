&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;August Richard &amp;quot;Gus&amp;quot; Suhr&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (January 3, 1906 – January 15, 2004) was a [[Major League Baseball]] [[first baseman]]. Suhr was born in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States|USA]]. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed.

Suhr was a career .279 hitter with 84 [[home run]]s and 818 [[Run batted in|RBI]] in 1435 games played with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] (1930–39) and [[Philadelphia Phillies]] (1939–40).

Prior to playing in the majors, Suhr played for the [[Pacific Coast League|San Francisco Seals]]. In 1929, he hit .381 with 51 home runs and 177 RBI for his team. In his rookie season with the Pirates, he belted 17 homers with 107 RBI. He produced three 100-RBI seasons in his 11-year career.

On September 11, 1931, Suhr started a then [[National League]] record streak of 822 [[games played]], which ended on June 4, 1937 when he missed a game to attend his mother&amp;apos;s funeral.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Gus_Suhr_1906|title=The Ballplayers – Gus Suhr|accessdate=January 28, 2009|last=Eckhouse|first=Morris A.|publisher=BaseballLibrary.com}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; His record stood until June 12, 1957 when it was broken by [[Stan Musial]].
