&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pai Yuen Airport&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the main airport in [[Guangzhou]], [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China]], until August 5, 2004, when it was replaced by the identically named [[Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport]], some 25 kilometers to the north. The airport was opened in 1932. &amp;quot;Baiyun&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;white clouds&amp;quot; in Chinese. The airport got this name as it was located beside the [[Baiyun Mountain]].

Aerial views of the old airport now shows re-development of the airport is underway. Roads now criss-cross across the old runways and the terminal complex is surrounded by new residential buildings and other developments. Several aircraft are now located at the former airports taxiways.

The current Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport is located {{convert|25|km|mi}} north of the former airport site.

==History==

The old airport opened in 1932. Due to growth of Guangzhou, the airport couldn&amp;apos;t be expanded to meet passengers needs as buildings surrounded the airport. There were also complaints with noise from aircraft. Plans were underway to replace the airport. On August 5, 2004, the new Baiyun airport opened and the old airport was closed. The land that the old airport occupies is being redeveloped.{{cn|date=July 2012}}

==Redevelopment==

Plans for the site of the old airport include a large shopping mall. The former terminal of the airport is being converted into a large shopping mall. Other plans are converting the northern portion of the former airport into a provincial-and city-level functional area integrating conference services. The southern portion will be converted into Guangzhou&amp;apos;s secondary center integrating retail business, Cultural, sports, business, and commercial activities.

==Incidents and accidents==
