The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gulf of Ob&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ob Bay&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) ({{lang-ru|О́бская губа́}}, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Obskaya guba&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[headlands and bays|bay]] of the [[Arctic Ocean]], located in Northern [[Russia]] at the mouth of the [[Ob River]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;earth&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.eosnap.com/tag/gulf-of-ob/ &amp;quot;Gulf of Ob.&amp;quot;] [http://www.eosnap.com Earthsnapshot.com]. Accessed June 2011.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

This Gulf flows into the [[Kara Sea]] between the [[Gydan Peninsula|Gydan]] and [[Yamal Peninsula|Yamal]] peninsulas.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;earth&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; It is about 1,000&amp;amp;nbsp;km (600&amp;amp;nbsp;mi) long and varies in width from about 50&amp;amp;nbsp;km (30&amp;amp;nbsp;mi) to 80&amp;amp;nbsp;km (50&amp;amp;nbsp;mi), and generally runs north and south.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;earth&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  It is relatively shallow, with an average depth from ten to twelve metres which restricts heavy sea transport. The [[Taz Estuary]] is an eastern side-branch formed by the [[Taz River]].

There are several islands near the mouth of the Ob, at the beginning of the estuary, like &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Khaley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. All these islands are close to the shore and they are generally flat and low-lying. They are protected wetlands under [[Ramsar sites in Russia|Ramsar]]. Further north, except for a few islands located close to the shore, like &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Khalevigo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nyavigo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the Gulf of Ob is free of islands until it meets the [[Kara Sea]].

Very large [[natural gas|gas]] and [[petroleum|oil]] deposits have been discovered in this region.  Oil and gas from the wells are sent South via [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] and [[rail transport]].  The [[Yamburg gas field]] is the world&amp;apos;s [[World Largest Gas Fields|third largest]] [[natural gas field]], and is located between the southern portion of the gulf and the Taz Estuary to the east.
