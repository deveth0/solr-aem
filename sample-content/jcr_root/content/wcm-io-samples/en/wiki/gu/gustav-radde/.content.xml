&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gustav Ferdinand Richard Radde&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (27 November 1831 - 2 March 1903) was a [[Germany|German]] [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[List of explorers|explorer]].

==Biography==
Radde was born in [[Danzig]], the son of a [[schoolmaster]]. He had little formal education, and began a career as an [[apothecary]]. He became increasingly interested in natural history, and in 1852 he gave up his career and spent two years in the [[Crimea]] with the botanist [[Christian von Steven]], collecting both plants and animals. He made further trips to southern Russia with [[Johann Friedrich von Brandt]] and [[Karl Ernst von Baer]]. He was botanist and zoologist on the East Siberian Expedition of 1855, led by the astronomer [[Ludwig Schwarz (astronomer)|Ludwig Schwarz]].

In 1864 he eventually settled in [[Tbilisi]]. In the same year he explored the region surrounding [[Mount Elbrus]], the highest mountain in the [[Western Palearctic]]. As well as collecting many plants he recorded the languages, ballads and customs of the local tribes. He set up a museum (the Caucasus Museum) and library in Tbilisi to exhibit his discoveries. His collecting expeditions included visits along the [[Black Sea]] coast and eastwards beyond the [[Caspian Sea]] to [[Askhabad]]. In 1895 he sailed to [[India]] and [[Japan]] with the Grand Duke Michael, and two years later he was official naturalist on a visit by members of the Russian imperial family to [[North Africa]]. He eventually became a member of the Council of State
in Tiblisi.

In 1884 he was honoured with the chairmanship of the first [[International Ornithological Congress]] in [[Vienna]]. He was also an honorary member of the D. O.-G., and a foreign member of the [[British Ornithologists&amp;apos; Union]] and the [[Zoological Society of London]]. [[Animal]]s named after him include [[bird]]s such as [[Radde&amp;apos;s Warbler]] and [[Radde&amp;apos;s Accentor]], and the [[Bufo raddei|Radde&amp;apos;s Toad]], or Siberian (Sand) Toad (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bufo raddei&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

==Collections==
Radde was an avid [[entomologist]]. His insect (and other) collections are divided: [[Transbaikal]] and [[Amur Oblast|Amur]] material is in the [[Zoological Museum of the Russian Academy of Science]], [[Caucasus]] and [[Transcaspian]] material is in the [[Georgian National Museum]] Zoological Section, Tbilisi.
