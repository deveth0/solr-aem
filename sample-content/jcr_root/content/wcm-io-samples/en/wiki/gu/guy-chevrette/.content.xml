        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Guy Chevrette&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born January 10, 1940 in [[Saint-Come, Quebec]]) served as [[Parti Québécois]] leader of the Opposition in the [[National Assembly of Quebec]], [[Canada]], from 1987 to 1989. He was the MNA for the riding of [[Joliette-Montcalm]] from 1976 to 1981 and [[Joliette (provincial electoral district)|Joliette]] from 1981 to 2002.

When former [[Premier of Quebec|Premier]] [[Pierre-Marc Johnson]] quit politics in 1987 after losing the [[Quebec general election, 1985|1985 election]], Chevrette became leader of the Opposition. In 1988, the PQ elected a new leader, [[Jacques Parizeau]], however Parizeau was not sitting in the National Assembly since he had resigned in 1984.

In the [[Quebec general election, 1989|1989 election]], Parizeau won a seat and replaced Chevrette as leader of the Opposition.

After the PQ won the [[Quebec general election, 1994|1994 election]], Chevrette served in various ministerial posts in cabinet in the governments of Parizeau, [[Lucien Bouchard]] and [[Bernard Landry]].  He resigned and quit politics in 2002.

In 2003, he founded a lobbying firm with longtime chief of staff, Pierre Chateauvert.  In 2005, he was appointed executive officer of the Quebec Forest Council, a private association defending the forestry industry.
