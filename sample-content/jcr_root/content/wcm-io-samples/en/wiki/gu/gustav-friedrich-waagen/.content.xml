&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gustav Friedrich Waagen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (February 11, 1794&amp;amp;ndash;July 15, 1868) was a [[Germany|German]] art historian. In the light of later research his writings are not of much value as regards trustworthy criticism, though they are useful as catalogues of art treasures in private collections at the time when they were compiled. His opinions were greatly respected in England, where he was invited to give evidence before the royal commission inquiring into the condition and future of the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], for which he was a leading candidate to become director. He died on a visit to [[Copenhagen]] in 1868.

==Biography==
Waagen was born in [[Hamburg]], the son of a painter and nephew of the poet [[Ludwig Tieck]]. Having passed through the college of [[Hirschberg]]{{dn|date=May 2012}}, he volunteered for service in the Napoleonic campaign of 1813-1814, and on his return attended the lectures at [[University of Wroclaw|Breslau University]]. He devoted himself to the study of art, which he pursued in the great European galleries, first in Germany, then in Holland and Italy.

A pamphlet on the brothers [[Van Eyck]] led in 1832 to his appointment to the directorship of the newly founded Berlin Museum, now vastly expanded as the [[Berlin State Museums]], although his main interest was the paintings in what is now the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]. The result of a journey to [[London]] and [[Paris]] was an important publication in three volumes, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kunstwerke und Künstler in England und Paris&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Berlin, 1837-1839), which became the basis for his more important &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Treasures of Art in Great Britain&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, translated by [[Elizabeth Eastlake]], (4 vols, London, 1854 and 1857).  This remains a key source for the [[provenance]] of paintings then in England.  Although Waagen has been criticised for his &amp;quot;amateurish and erratic expertise&amp;quot; by modern standards, his work was regarded as highly authoritative for the next half-century.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Reitlinger, Gerald; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Economics of Taste, Vol I: The Rise and Fall of Picture Prices 1760-1960&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p. 110, Barrie and Rockliffe, London, 1961&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1844 he was appointed professor of art history at the [[Berlin University]], and in 1861 he was called to [[St Petersburg]] as adviser in the arranging and naming of the pictures in the imperial collection. On his return he published a book on the Hermitage collection (Munich, 1864). Among his other publications are some essays on [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Luca Signorelli|Signorelli]]; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kunstwerke und Künstler in Deutschland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Die vornehmsten Kunstdenkmäler in Wien&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
