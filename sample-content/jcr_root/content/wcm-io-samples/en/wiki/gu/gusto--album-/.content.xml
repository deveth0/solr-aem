&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gusto&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the eighth album by the [[Huntington Beach, California]] [[punk rock]] band [[Guttermouth]], released in 2002 by [[Epitaph Records]].  It found the band taking their style of fast, abrasive punk rock in new directions, experimenting with elements of [[pop (music)|pop]] and other styles.  Their usual tongue-in-cheek humor and sarcastic lyrics remain intact, but the album&amp;apos;s overall sound is quite different from any of their others.  This was due partly to a lineup change: founding member and frequent songwriter James Nunn had left the group the previous year, leaving guitarists Scott Sheldon and Eric Davis to fill in on [[bass guitar|bass]], along with studio bassist Hedge.  The album received generally poor reviews from both critics and longtime fans, and would later be regarded by the band as somewhat of a failed experiment.
