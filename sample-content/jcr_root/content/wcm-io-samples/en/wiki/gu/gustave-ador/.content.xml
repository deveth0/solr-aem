&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gustave Ador&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (December 23, 1845 – March 31, 1928) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] politician. In 1919, he became [[President of the Confederation (Switzerland)|President of the Confederation]].

==Biography==
===Origins===
He was born in [[Cologny]]. He was the grandson of Jean Pierre Ador, an immigrant from [[Vaud]], who obtained his Genevan citizenship in 1814.  He studied law at the [[University of Geneva|academy (now the university) of Geneva]], and in 1868 became a lawyer.

===Early political career===
In 1871 he started his political career as member of the communal council of [[Cologny]], and was twice mayor, in 1878-9 and 1883-5. He was a member of the [[Grand Council of Geneva|cantonal parliament]] 1874-6, and continuously from 1878 to 1915 save for a short break in 1902. In 1878-9 he represented Geneva in the [[Council of States (Switzerland)|Swiss Conseil des États]]. Then he became a member of the executive of the [[canton of Geneva]], being put in charge of the Department of Justice and Police. He resigned after an unfavourable election in 1880, but once more became member of the cantonal executive in 1885, and for 12 years had charge of the cantonal finances.

===National Council===
In 1889 he became a member of the [[National Council (Switzerland)|Swiss Conseil National]] (Swiss National Council), and remained so until 1917, being elected [[President of the Swiss National Council]] in 1901. He was president of the cantonal executive in 1890, 1892, and 1896. In 1894 he became lieutenant-colonel in the [[Swiss Army]]. In 1914 he founded in Geneva the association for facilitating communications between prisoners of war and the central Geneva agency, and succeeded in giving this enterprise great importance and a widespread extension.

===Federal Council===
After the enforced resignation of [[Arthur Hoffmann (politician)|Arthur Hoffmann]], Ador, in order to soothe the [[Triple Entente|Entente]], became a [[Federal Council of Switzerland|federal councillor]] (a member of the Federal Executive) on June 26, 1917. He was entrusted with the [[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs|Department of Foreign Affairs]]. Towards the end of 1918 he was elected by Parliament to be the [[President of the Confederation (Switzerland)|Swiss President]] for 1919, but retired from the Federal Executive at the end of his year of office, on December 31, 1919. During his time as councillor, along with being in the Department of Foreign Affairs (1917), he was later in the [[Department of Home Affairs (Switzerland)|Department of Home Affairs]] (1918 - 1919). He was affiliated with the [[Liberal Party of Switzerland|Liberal Party]].
