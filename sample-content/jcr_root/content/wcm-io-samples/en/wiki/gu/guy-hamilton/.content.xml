&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Guy Hamilton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 16 September 1922&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800032716/bio&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) is an English [[film director]].

He made 22 [[film]]s from the 1950s to the 1980s, including four [[James Bond]] films.

He was married at one time to actress [[Naomi Chance]].

==Superman and Batman==
Hamilton was originally chosen to direct &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Superman (film)|Superman: The Movie]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1978, but due to his status as a [[tax exile]] he was only allowed to be in [[England]] for thirty days, where production had moved at the last minute to [[Pinewood Studios]]. The job of director was then passed to [[Richard Donner]], but Hamilton insisted he be [[Guarantee (film)|paid in full]].

In the late 1980s Guy Hamilton was also approached to direct &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news|author=Bill &amp;quot;Jett&amp;quot; Ramey| title=An Interview With Michael Uslan-Part 1|publisher=Batman-on-Film|date=2005-09-06| url = http://www.batman-on-film.com/interview_muslan_2.html| accessdate=2007-09-16}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
