&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gustavo Adolfo Polidor González&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [poh-lee-DOR], (October 26, 1961 – April 28, 1995), was a [[shortstop]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played for the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]] (1985–88), [[Milwaukee Brewers]] (1989–90) and [[Florida Marlins]] (1993). He was born in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]].

His best year was 1987 with the Angels, when he hit for a .263 [[batting average]], with 2 [[home run|homers]] and 15 [[Run batted in|RBI]] in 137 [[at bats]]. After dropping off to .148 in 1988 he was traded to the Brewers. Polidor played in a career-high 79 games in 1989 and was later a member of the Marlins in their 1993 inaugural season.

In his major league career, Polidor batted .207, with 2 home runs, 35 [[runs batted in]], 33 [[Run (baseball statistics)|runs scored]], 15 [[double (baseball)|doubles]] and 3 [[stolen base]]s.

Polidor made a brief comeback attempt as a [[replacement player]] with the [[Montreal Expos]] in spring training of 1995. Less than a month later, he was murdered in Caracas as he tried to protect his son from two men who were trying to steal his car.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_MURAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=c-wDAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=3612,6701246&amp;amp;dq=gus+polidor+murder&amp;amp;hl=en Former Marlin killed]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He was only 33 years old.
