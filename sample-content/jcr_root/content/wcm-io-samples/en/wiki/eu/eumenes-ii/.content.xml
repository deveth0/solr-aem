&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eumenes II of Pergamon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Εὐμένης Β&amp;apos; τῆς Περγάμου) (ruled 197–159 BC) was king of [[Pergamon]] and a member of the [[Attalid dynasty]]. The son of king [[Attalus I]] and queen Apollonis, he followed in his father&amp;apos;s footsteps and collaborated with the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] to oppose first [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]], then [[Seleucid]] expansion towards the Aegean, leading to the defeat of [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus the Great]] at the [[Battle of Magnesia]] in 190 BC. Following the [[peace of Apamea]] in 188 BC, he received the regions of [[Phrygia]], [[Lydia]], [[Pisidia]], [[Pamphylia]], and parts of [[Lycia]] from his Roman allies, as they had no desire to actually administer territory in the Hellenistic east but wished for a strong state in Asia Minor as a bulwark against any possible Seleucid expansion in the future. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} He later fell out of favour with the Romans after they suspected him of conspiring with [[Perseus of Macedon]] and consequently in 167 BC, the Romans made an abortive attempt to suborn his brother [[Attalus II]], as a pretender to the Pergamene throne and refused Eumenes entry into Italy to plead his case.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;A History of Rome, M. Cary &amp;amp; H.Scullard (1935), p165 ISBN 0-333-27830-5&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

One of the great achievements of Eumenes II was the expansion of the [[Library of Pergamum|Library at Pergamon]], one of the great libraries of the Ancient World and the place traditionally associated with the creation of [[parchment]], although it had actually existed for centuries.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} He also built a [[Stoa of Eumenes|stoa]] on the Athenian acropolis. Married to [[Stratonice of Pergamon]], daughter of [[Ariarathes IV]], King of [[Cappadocia]], and wife Antiochis, they were the parents of [[Attalus III]]. Since their son was still a minor, the throne was assumed by his brother [[Attalus II]], who married Eumenes&amp;apos; widow Stratonice.
