:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;St. Eustathius redirects here; see also [[Saint Eustace]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eustathius of Antioch&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, sometimes surnamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;the Great&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was a [[bishop]] and [[patriarch of Antioch]] in the 4th century.

He was a native of [[Side]] in [[Pamphylia]]. About 320 he was bishop of [[Aleppo|Beroea]], and he became [[patriarch of Antioch]] shortly before the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] in 325. In that assembly he distinguished himself zealously against the [[Arianism|Arians]], though the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Allocutio ad Imperatorem&amp;apos;&amp;apos; with which he has been credited is hardly genuine.

His anti–Arian polemic against [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] made him unpopular among his fellow bishops in the East, and a synod convened at Antioch in 330 deposed him for adultery,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Philostorgius]], in Photius, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, book 2, chapter 7.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; which was confirmed by the emperor.

For instance, in the dispute with Eustathius of Antioch, who opposed the growing influence of Origen and his practice of an allegorical exegesis of scripture, seeing in his theology the roots of Arianism, Eusebius, an admirer of [[Origen]], was reproached by Eustathius for deviating from the Nicene faith, who was charged in turn with [[Sabellianism]]. Eustathius was accused, condemned, and deposed at a synod in Antioch. The people of Antioch rebelled against this action, while the anti-Eustathians proposed Eusebius as the new bishop, but he declined. He was banished to [[Trajanopolis]] in [[Thrace]], where he died, probably about 337, though possibly not until 370.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|last=Socrates Scholasticus|title=Ecclesiastical History|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.vii.xiv.html}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The only complete work by Eustathius is the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Engastrimytho contra Origenem&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ed. by [[A. Jahn]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Texte und Untersuchungen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ii. 4; J. H. Declerck in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Corpus Christianorum - Series Graeca&amp;apos;&amp;apos; no. 51, 2002), which discusses the episode of the Witch of Endor in 1 Samuel. Other fragments are enumerated by [[G. F. Loofs]] in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herzog-Hauck’s Realencyklopädie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The [[Ps.Eustathius, Commentary on the Hexameron|Commentary on the Hexameron]] attributed to him in the manuscripts is not authentic.
