The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;European Academy for Environmental Affairs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also known as: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;European Academy of Environmental Affairs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a private organization which gave its label for the [[Leipzig Declaration on Global Climate Change]], a [[Science and Environmental Policy Project|SEPP]]-initiated document in which some scientists argue against [[global warming]] theories.

In 1993 this Academy held a conference in [[Mannheim]] under the title &amp;quot;Globale Erwärmung - Tatsache oder Behauptung?&amp;quot; (Global warming—fact or fiction?).

On [http://www.iwoe.de/EuropAkademie.html EuropAcademie] there is a list of textbooks on [[ecology]] issued by the Academy.
Founder and president of the Academy was the late Prof. Dr. hc. [[Helmut Metzner]] (1925-1999), who was professor for chemical [[plant physiology]].

An article by Metzner about his view on climate change can be found on the right-wing website konservativ.de. He was accused of having strong connections to the [[Studienzentrum Weikersheim]], a right-wing think-tank in [[Baden-Württemberg]]. [http://www.projektwerkstatt.de/oepunkte/althefte/ausgaben/01/54_clinton.html]

The Academy was recognized in a consultative function by the [[Council of Europe]], but the status was withdrawn because of the Academy&amp;apos;s failure to comply with its obligations.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=251911&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

There are no webpages of the Academy, and there are some hints that is now defunct. It may have ceased operation with the death of [[Helmut Metzner|Metzner]].
