&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;EuroLinux&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a campaigning organisation that promotes [[open source software]] / [[free software]] in [[Europe]], and that are opposed to the [[European Union]]&amp;apos;s proposals to introduce laws on [[software patent]]s. It is also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;EuroLinux Alliance&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
It is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;not&amp;apos;&amp;apos; the [[umbrella organisation]] for [[Linux User Group]]s in Europe.

It describes itself as: &amp;quot;The EuroLinux Alliance for a [[Free Information Infrastructure]] is an open coalition of commercial companies and non-profit associations united to promote and protect a vigorous European Software Culture based on [[copyright]], [[open standard]]s, open competition and open source software such as Linux. Corporate members or sponsors of EuroLinux develop or sell software under free, semi-free and non-free licenses for [[operating system]]s such as [[Linux]], [[Mac OS]] or [[Microsoft Windows]].&amp;quot;

Eurolinux organised the public EU campaign against software patents that was signed by more than 300,000 people. Members include [[FFII]], APRIL, [[AFUL]], AEL, and European Linux user group (LUG) umbrella associations.
