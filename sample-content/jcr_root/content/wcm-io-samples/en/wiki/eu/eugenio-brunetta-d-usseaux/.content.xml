Count &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eugenio Brunetta d&amp;apos;Usseaux&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (December 14, 1857 â€“ January 8, 1919) was an [[Italy|Italian]] nobleman.

Born in [[Vercelli]] into a family of [[French people|French]] origin, Brunetta d&amp;apos;Usseaux was educated in [[Turin]]. Himself an active rower and rider, the count was very interested in sports, and a meeting with Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]] interested him for the reinstatement of the [[Olympic Games]]. In 1897, Brunetta d&amp;apos;Usseaux became a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), which he remained until his death.

He succeeded in bringing the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] to [[Rome]], but Italy had to forfeit the organization of the Olympics in 1906, due to financial and organisational problems. The 1908 Games were held in London instead. That same year, Brunetta d&amp;apos;Usseaux was appointed secretary of the IOC. In this position, he tried to get winter sports on the Olympic programme, and suggested to have a separate winter sports week attached to the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]]. This was opposed by the Swedish organizers, but Brunetta d&amp;apos;Usseaux managed to get a winter sports week scheduled for 1916. Due to [[World War I]], these Olympics were never organized. The count died, under unclear circumstances, in France in 1919, and would not live to see the first [[Winter Olympic Games]] in 1924.
