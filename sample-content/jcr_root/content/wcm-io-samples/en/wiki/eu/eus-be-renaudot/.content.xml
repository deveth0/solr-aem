&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eusèbe Renaudot&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (July 20, 1646 – September 7, 1720) was a [[France|French]] [[theology|theologian]] and [[oriental studies|Orientalist]].

==Biography==
Renaudot was born in [[Paris]], and brought up and educated for a career in the church. After being educated by the Jesuits, and joining the Oratorians in 1666, he was in poor health, left his order, and never took more than [[minor orders]].&amp;lt;ref name=CE&amp;gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Eusebius Renaudot}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Despite his interest in [[theology]] and his title of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[abbé]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, much of his life was spent at the French court, where he attracted the notice of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] and was often employed in confidential affairs.

He was a prominent supporter of [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet]], in the controversies with [[Richard Simon]], [[François Fénelon]] and the Jesuits. In later life his attitudes became [[Gallican]] and [[Jansenist]]. He became a member of the [[Académie française]] (1689), the [[Academy of Inscriptions]] (1691), and the [[Accademia della Crusca]] of Florence.&amp;lt;ref name=CE/&amp;gt;

==Works==
The learning in Eastern languages which he acquired in his youth and maintained amid the distractions of court life did not bear fruit until he was sixty-two.

Renaudot&amp;apos;s best-known books are &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Historia Patriarcharum Alexandrinorum]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Paris, 1713) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Liturgiarum orientalium collectio&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2 vols., 1715–16). The latter was designed to supply proofs of the perpetuity of the faith of the church on the subject of the [[sacraments]], the topic on which most of his theological writings turned, and which was then, in consequence of the controversies attaching to [[Antoine Arnauld]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Perpétuité de la foy de l’Église&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a major matter of debate between French [[Catholics]] and [[Protestants]].

Other works were &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gennadii Patriarchae Constantinopolitani Homiliae de Eucharistia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Paris, 1709) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Anciennes relations des Indes et de la Chine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Paris, 1718).&amp;lt;ref name=CE/&amp;gt;
