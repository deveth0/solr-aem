In [[Greek mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eurotas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Lang-el|Εὐρώτας}}) was a king of [[Laconia]], the son of King [[Myles]] and grandson of [[Lelex]], [[Eponym|eponymous]] ancestor of the [[Leleges]]. He had no male heir, but he did have a daughter [[Sparta (mythology)|Sparta]] and wife Clete. Eurotas bequeathed the kingdom to his grandson, [[Lacedaemon (mythology)|Lacedaemon]], the son of Taygete, after whom Mount [[Taygetus]] is named, and Zeus, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].&amp;lt;ref name=Paus_3.1.1&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Guide to Greece&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 3.1.1-3.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Lacedaemon renamed the state after his wife.

Pausanias says: &amp;quot;It was Eurotas who channelled away the marsh-water from the plains by cutting through to the sea, and when the land was drained he called the river which was left running there the [[Eurotas (river)|Eurotas]].&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=Paus_3.1.1/&amp;gt; The &amp;quot;cutting through&amp;quot; is seen by Pausanias’ translator and commentator, Peter Levy, S.J., as an explanation of Eurotas (or Vrodamas) Canyon, a ravine north of [[Skala, Laconia|Skala]] where the river has cut through the foothills of Taygetus after changing direction to the west of the valley.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book | author=Pausanias | coauthor=Peter Levy, S.J. (Translator, Contributor) | title=Pausanias Guide to Greece | date=1971 | publisher=Penguin Books | volume=Volume 2, Southern Greece | page=10 Note 3}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Variants==
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; gives a slight variant of the mythological generation of Eurotas: the latter is the son of Lelex, born from the ground and [[Cleocharia]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 3.10.3.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Eurotas in art==
River-gods are typically represented in Greek art, such as coin motifs, as figures with the bodies of bulls and the faces of humans. If only the face appears, they might wear horns and have wavy hair or be accompanied by fish. [[Claudius Aelianus]] states that the Eurotas and other rivers are like bulls.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |first=Maxime | last=Collignon | first2=Jane E.
