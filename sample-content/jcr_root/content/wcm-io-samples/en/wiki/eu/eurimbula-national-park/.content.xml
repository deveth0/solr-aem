&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eurimbula&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a national park in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], 411&amp;amp;nbsp;km north of [[Brisbane]]. The nearest town is [[Agnes Water, Queensland|Agnes Water]].

Eurimbula consists of three separate sections. The main section is centred around Eurimbula Creek and is accessible ([[4WD]] recommended) from the main Agnes Water road. There are camping facilities at Bustard Beach near the mouth of Eurimbula Creek. Inland, a short uphill walk leads to a lookout, known as Ganoonga Noonga, with views of the coast and [[paperbark]] swamps of the park. Further north, there is another camping ground at Middle Creek, however there are no facilities here.

The northern section of the park includes Rodds Peninsula and Bustard Head and its [[Bustard Head Light|lighthouse]]. Tours from the [[1770, Queensland|Town of 1770]] regularly visit Bustard Head, however Rodds Peninsula is accessible only by private boat. The western section of the park is rugged and extremely difficult to reach.
