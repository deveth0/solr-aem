        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;EAPC&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), a [[NATO]] institution, is a multilateral forum created to improve relations between NATO and non-NATO countries in [[Europe]] and those parts of [[Asia]] on the European periphery. States meet to cooperate and go to the range of political and security issues. It was formed on January 1, 1997 as the failure to the [[North Atlantic Cooperation Council]] (NACC) and works alongside the [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP), both created post-[[Cold War]] - the former in 1991, the latter in 1994.
