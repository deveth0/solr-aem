The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gary Steelheads&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were a professional [[basketball]] team that played in the [[International Basketball League]]. In the past they played in the [[International Basketball League (1999-2001)|International Basketball League]], [[Continental Basketball Association]], and the [[United States Basketball League]].  They were based in [[Gary, Indiana]] and played their home games at the [[Genesis Convention Center]]. The Steelheads were the 2006 CBA Eastern Conference champions.

==History==
[[Image:Steelheads_Logo.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Former logo, while in the CBA]]
Gary was awarded a franchise in the CBA in 2000. The league folded so the Steelheads joined the IBL. Former CBA franchise owners purchased the CBA name from the bancruptcy court. The IBL and IBA combined to reform the CBA in 2001. After playing five seasons in the CBA the team announced on July 21, 2006, that they would be sitting out the 2006-07 CBA season.

During that time former owner Jewell Harris Sr. was indicted on federal extortion and other charges unrelated to the team. Harris resigned from the team pending a sale.

On October 24, the new ownership, Showtime Sports and Entertainment, LLC (headlined by Jewell Harris Jr.), announced they would be moving to the USBL for 2007.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thetimesonline.com/articles/2006/10/24/columnists/al_hamnik/6df79e45b3209a718625721100088eef.txt | title = USBL lands big catch in Steelheads | last = Hamnik | first = Al | publisher = The Northwest Indiana and Illinois Times | date = 2006-10-24 | accessdate = 2009-04-02}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

After one season in the USBL, which included multiple teams folding, the Steelheads joined the [[International Basketball League|IBL]] (unrelated to the former IBL) for the 2008 season. The Steelheads will sit out the 2009 season.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nwitimes.com/articles/2008/11/21/sports/top_sports/doc2f43034264a17709862575080003ba75.txt | title = Gary Steelheads to sit out 2009 IBL season | last = Hamnik | first = Al | publisher = The Northwest Indiana and Illinois Times | date = 2008-11-21| accessdate = 2009-04-02}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
