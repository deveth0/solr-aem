In [[cartography]], the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gauss–Krüger&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, named after [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Johann Heinrich Louis Krüger]], is used in three slightly different ways.
* Often, it is just a synonym for the [[transverse Mercator]] map [[map projection|projection]].  Another synonym is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gauss conformal projection&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
* Sometimes, the term is used for a particular computational method for transverse Mercator: that is, how to convert between latitude/longitude and projected coordinates.  There is no simple closed formula to do so when the earth is modelled as an ellipsoid.  But the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gauss–Krüger&amp;apos;&amp;apos; method gives the same results as other methods, at least if you are sufficiently near the central meridian: less than 100 degrees of longitude, say.  Farther away, some methods become inaccurate.
* The term is also used for a particular set of transverse Mercator projections used in narrow zones in Europe and South America, at least in Germany, Turkey, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Finland and Argentina.  This &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gauss–Krüger&amp;apos;&amp;apos; system is similar to the [[universal transverse Mercator]] system, but the central meridians of the Gauss–Krüger zones are only 3° apart, as opposed to 6° in UTM.  As a consequence, the scale variation within a Gauss–Krüger zone is about 1/6 of what it is in a UTM zone.  More information on this system can be found on the German Wikipedia.
