==Early life==
Born in [[Penygroes, Gwynedd]], Thomas is the son of a toolmaker. Although brought up on [[Merseyside]] he is a fluent [[Welsh language]] speaker. He went to Rock Ferry High School on Ravenswood Avenue in [[Rock Ferry]], [[Birkenhead]].

After graduating in law ([[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]]) from the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]] in 1976, he was initially employed in the insurance industry and managed a loss adjusting company in the [[West Indies]]. He graduated from the [[Council of Legal Education]] (CLE) in 1977. He has been a [[barrister]] in a private practice since 1986 specialising in personal injury litigation and is a member of [[Amicus]].

==Parliamentary career==
A member of [[Flintshire]] [[County Council]] between 1995–97, Thomas was elected to Parliament in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]]. His political interests include Wales, legal reform, social security and the environment. He was a member of the [[Select Committee on Welsh Affairs]], the Select Committee on Social Security and the [[Joint Human Rights Committee]].
Following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]] he was appointed [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the [[Secretary of State for Wales]], [[Paul Murphy (UK politician)|Paul Murphy]], and in October 2002 moved with Murphy to the [[Northern Ireland Office]] in the same capacity.

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], Thomas was narrowly defeated by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] candidate [[David Jones (MP for Clwyd West)|David Jones]].
