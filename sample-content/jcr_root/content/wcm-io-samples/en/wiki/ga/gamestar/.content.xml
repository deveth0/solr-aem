&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;GameStar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a monthly released [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] [[computer game]] [[magazine]], published by the [[IDG|IDG Entertainment Media]] GmbH in [[Germany]]. In 2008 it had an average monthly [[Magazine circulation|circulation]] of 250,000 copies and is therefore the best sold PC computer game magazine in Europe.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;IDG Communications Media AG, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://www.gamestar.de/images/mediadaten/GS_Mediadaten_2009.pdf GameStar Mediadaten 2009]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1 October 2008 (German)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is also being published in [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[China]]. IDG started it also in [[Italy]], [[Poland]] and the [[USA]] -- but those issues have folded after a few months, although the corresponding web sites still exist. The US version was, quite differently from the rest, positioned as a magazine for adults, about PC and console games, similar to [[inCite]]. In 2005, GameStar spawned a sister mag called /GameStar/dev which is targeted at European Game Developers. GameStar also has a sister magazine named [[GamePro]], which focuses on console games. Incidentally its headquarters are right next-door to the GameStar office.

Editor-in-Chief at the moment is Michael Trier. He succeeded Gunnar Lott on 1 December 2007.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;IDG Communications Media AG, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://www.idgmedia.de/index.cfm?pid=1310&amp;amp;fk=1293 Gunnar Lott new Director of Online and New Business]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 28 November 2007 (German)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

A short overview of the content:
*News about the PC gaming community
*Previews of PC games, (games which still are in development)
*Tests ([[review]]s) of lately released or to be released PC games
*A section about [[freeware]] and [[open source]] games, [[Mod (computer gaming)|mods]] and [[Electronic sports|e-sports]].
*Articles about recent [[personal computer hardware]] components with regard to computer gaming (e.g. [[joystick]]s or [[computer mouse|computer mice]])
*Articles about important events, that influence the gaming community at large (i.e.: E-Sports, Censorship, etc.)

Currently there are 4 different versions of the Magazine available. They include the magazine version (which does not include any DVDs and is thus cheaper), a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; edition, which includes one DVD, and an XL Version, which contains 2 DVDs. The subscriber Magazine has less advertisement and shows a larger front-page picture. Until mid-2005 a CD-only version was also available, but it was decided that DVD-readers in Computers had become widespread enough, and so the CD-version was deemed unnecessary. Instead the XL version appeared for the first time.

GameStar was published in the US starting in summer 2004, before the first issue was shipped the magazine was changed from 12 to 8 issues a year (not being published in July, August, September and October). To try to draw more appeal to the magazine female models were featured in the &amp;quot;Digital Lust&amp;quot; page. After only 3 issues the magazine was canceled in the US.

GameStar also holds a well known E-Sports-League, the GameStar Clanliga.
