The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gayal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bos frontalis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a large [[cattle]] that is the [[domesticated]] form of the [[gaur]]. They are most commonly found in [[Bangladesh]] and northeast areas of [[India]] such as the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. In the [[Adi language]], gayal are called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;mithun&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; they are called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;subu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by the Apatani and Nishi tribes, or often referred to as &amp;quot;mithun&amp;quot; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;mithan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Taxonomy==
In his first description of 1804, [[Aylmer Bourke Lambert]] applied the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bos frontalis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to a domestic specimen probably from [[Chittagong]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ellerman, J. R., Morrison-Scott, T. C. S. (1966) [http://www.archive.org/stream/checklistofindia00elle#page/380/mode/2up &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Checklist of Palaearctic and Indian mammals 1758 to 1946&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]. Second edition. London: British Museum of Natural History. Page 380&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 2003, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] fixed the first available [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] based on a wild population that the name for this wild species is valid by virtue of its being antedated by a name based on a domestic form. Most authors have adopted the binomial &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bos frontalis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for the domestic species as valid for the [[taxon]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Gentry, A. Clutton-Brock, J., Groves, C. P. (2004) [http://arts.anu.edu.au/grovco/J%20Arch%20Sci.pdf &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The naming of wild animal species and their domestic derivatives&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]. Journal of Archaeological Science 31: 645â€“651&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== In culture ==
[[File:Mithun.jpg|thumb|left|A Mithun from [[Thrissur Zoo]]]]
To the [[Adi people]] (Bangni-Bokar [[Lhoba]]s), the possession of gayal is the traditional measure of a family&amp;apos;s wealth. Gayal are not milked or put to work but given supplementary care while grazing in the woods, until they are ritually slaughtered or killed for local consumption.

The gayal is the state animal of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and [[Nagaland]]. Gayals play an important role in the social life of the people in Arunachal Pradesh. Marriages are not fixed until the bridegroom&amp;apos;s family gives at least one gayal to the bride&amp;apos;s household.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Gayals are left in the forest, where they usually stay within a small perimeter. Females are usually aggressive when with calves, and there are instances known when people have been severely injured after being gored by one. Male are usually more docile.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
