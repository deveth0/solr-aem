&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Garrison &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (various spellings) (from the [[French language|French]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;garnison&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, itself from the verb &amp;apos;&amp;apos;garnir&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;to equip&amp;quot;) is the collective term for a body of [[troop]]s stationed in a particular location, originally to guard it, but now often simply using it as a home base.
The garrison is usually in a [[city]], [[town]], [[fort]], [[castle]] or similar. &amp;quot;Garrison town&amp;quot; is a common expression for any town that has a [[military base]] nearby.

==Arab garrison==
&amp;quot;Garrison towns&amp;quot; ({{lang-ar| حصون }}) were used during the [[Muslim conquests|Arab Islamic conquests]] of Middle Eastern lands by [[Arab]]-[[Muslim]] armies to increase their dominance over indigenous populations.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/donner.html The Early Islamic Conquests, by Fred Donner. Princeton University Press, 1981; forward from page 251.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In order to occupy non-Arab, non-Islamic areas, nomadic Arab tribesmen were taken from the desert by the ruling Arab elite, conscripted into Islamic armies, and settled into garrison towns as well as given a share in the [[Jizya|spoils of war]]. The primary utility of the Arab-Islamic garrisons was to control the indigenous non-Arab peoples of these conquered and occupied territories, and to serve as garrison bases to launch further Islamic military campaigns into yet-undominated lands. A secondary aspect of the Arab-Islamic garrisons was the uprooting of the aforementioned nomadic Arab tribesmen from their original home regions in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] in order to proactively avert these tribal peoples, and particularly their young men, from revolting against the Islamic state established in their midst.

==British and Irish garrison==
In the [[United Kingdom]], &amp;quot;Garrison&amp;quot; also specifically refers to any of the major military stations such as [[Aldershot]], [[Catterick Garrison|Catterick]], [[Colchester]], [[Tidworth]], [[Bulford]], and [[London]], which have more than one barracks or [[military camp|camp]] and their own military [[headquarters]], usually commanded by a [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]], [[Brigadier]] or [[Major General|Major-General]], assisted by a [[Garrison Sergeant Major]]. In [[Ireland]], [[Association football]] (as distinct from [[Gaelic football]]) has historically been termed the &amp;quot;garrison game&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;garrison sport&amp;quot; for its connections with British military serving in Irish cities and towns.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://anfearrua.com/ViewSectionDetail.asp?docid=1567 An Fear Rua - Garrison, Gallic and Gaelic&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Israeli garrison==
In [[Israel]], a &amp;quot;garrison unit&amp;quot; ({{lang-he| חיל מצב}}) is a regular unit defending a specified Israeli zone in need of protection from attack from combatants.  Israeli garrison units placed in the disputed territories of [[Judea and Samaria Area|Judea and Samaria]]/[[West Bank]] are recognized under [[UN Resolution 242]] as occupied pending peaceful recognition by all regional combatants.
== Ancient Rome garrison ==
{{main|Colonia (Roman)}}
It was an old custom in [[History of Italy during Roman times|ancient Italy]] to send out colonies for the purpose of securing new conquests. The [[Roman Republic|Romans]], having no [[standing army]], used to plant bodies of their own citizens in conquered towns as a kind of garrison.
