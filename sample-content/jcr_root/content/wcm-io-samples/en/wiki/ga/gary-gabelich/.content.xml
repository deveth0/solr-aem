&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gary Gabelich&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (August 29, 1940 â€“ January 26, 1984) was an American race car driver who set the [[land speed record]] with his [[rocket]]-powered vehicle &amp;quot;[[Blue Flame (car)|Blue Flame]]&amp;quot; on October 23, 1970, achieving an [[average]] speed of {{convert|622.287|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Only 13,000&amp;amp;nbsp;lbs. thrust was used during this attempt, and a peak speed of {{convert|650|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} was momentarily attained (record speed was {{convert|622.407|mi/h|km/h|3|abbr=on}} on a dry lake bed at [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in Wendover, [[Utah]]. This record was the first over {{convert|1000|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} and remained unbeaten until 1983, when [[Richard Noble]] broke it driving [[Thrust 2]].

In 1969 he set a drag-boat record of 200.44 miles per hour (322.38 km/h).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;amp;dat=19840127&amp;amp;id=eyg0AAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=CeEIAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=2540,4130331&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://dragboattv.com/gary-gabelich-bio/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Gabelich was seriously injured in the crash of an experimental 4 wheel drive [[Funny Car]]. Gabelich died in January 1984 in a motorcycle crash.

Gary was a delivery driver in his younger days for Vermillion&amp;apos;s Drug store driving a split window 1960 era VW kombi delivery van.
He lived at that time in [[Bixby Knolls]] area of [[Long Beach, CA]]. with his parents.
Gary served as an Apollo test astronaut for North American Aviation in 1968-1969 as stated on the plaque his family dedicated to him in 2001&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://s4.photobucket.com/albums/y141/gregwapling/hot-rods-down-under/land-speed-racing-history/gary-gabelich/gary-gabelich-plaque.jpg&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Gary and his family appeared on the [[Family Feud]] with [[Richard Dawson]], where he presented the key to the city of Long Beach, Ca. to Dawson.
