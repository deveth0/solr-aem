==History==
GameSurge was created in February 2004, as a result of the merger of GamesNET users and the ProGamePlayer Network, a network with common interests.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;pgpn_merger&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.irc101.org/news.php?id=370 GamesNET, ProGamePlayer Announce Network Merger]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The merger, coincidentally, occurred during a time of legal disputes over the domain name gamesnet.net.

At present day, the user base of GameSurge is primarily North American, with a growing number of [[English language|English-speaking]] gamers from [[Europe]]. The user base contains a large number of [[Clan (computer gaming)|clans]] who participate in a wide variety of games. Among the more popular games on GameSurge are &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Counter-Strike&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Counter-Strike: Source&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Team Fortress Classic]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Team Fortress 2]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Day of Defeat]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Urban Terror]] and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Call of Duty]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

== Services ==
GameSurge runs a [[feature-rich]] package of [[Internet Relay Chat services|services]] known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[srvx]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which was written by GameSurge&amp;apos;s development staff from scratch in [[C (programming language)|C]].

GameSurge provides five user-accessible services:
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;AuthServ&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which provides authentication for other services on the network and allows users to use an [[User (computing)|account]] to maintain channel access.  In the interests of providing a service directed toward gaming (and thus allowing users to easily switch clan/team/guild tags), GameSurge does not provide [[nickname]] registration.
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[ChanServ]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which provides facilities such as event logging and advanced user/ban management.
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HelpServ&amp;apos;&amp;apos; bots, which manage support requests in certain channels via a [[FIFO]] queue.
**&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HelpServ&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;#support&amp;apos;&amp;apos; channel, for general user support.
**Other &amp;apos;&amp;apos;HelpServ&amp;apos;&amp;apos; bots in miscellaneous help channels throughout the network.
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;SpamServ&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which provides spam protection services to channels on the network. This service was added in {{Start date|2008|7}}.
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;HostServ&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which provides free &amp;quot;titles&amp;quot; to users wishing to use cloaked hosts.  See the [http://www.gamesurge.net/titles GameSurge Titles] page for details.
