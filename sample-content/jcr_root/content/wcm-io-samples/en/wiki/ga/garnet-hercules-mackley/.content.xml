&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Garnet Hercules Mackley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (9 December 1883 &amp;amp;ndash; 24 April 1986) was a [[New Zealand]] businessman, railways manager and politician.

Mackley was born in [[Port Chalmers]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;DNZB Mackley&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{DNZB|Bellamy|Alan|5m21|Mackley, Garnet Hercules - Biography|5 January 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He became general manager of [[New Zealand Railways Department|New Zealand Railways]] in 1933. During his tenure, Mackley worked hard to improve the standard and range of services provided by the railways. He won approval for the construction of an inspection car known as the [[NZR RM class (Red Terror)|&amp;quot;Red Terror&amp;quot;]] in which he travelled the entire system inspecting stations and meeting staff. The car’s success encouraged him to order the construction of [[railcar]]s that were to serve the railways for many years, specifically the [[NZR RM class (Wairarapa)|Wairarapa]], [[NZR RM class (Standard)|Standard]], and [[NZR RM class (Vulcan)|Vulcan]] classes.

He also wanted to improve the comfort of passengers, and initiated a local building program which provided the basis of passenger carriage stock for many years.

In 1940 he retired, and was made managing director of the Whakatane Paper Mills.

Mackley then entered politics, becoming a Member of Parliament for the [[New Zealand National Party]]. He was elected as the MP for [[Masterton (New Zealand electorate)|Masterton]] (1943–1946) and then for [[Wairarapa (New Zealand electorate)|Wairarapa]] (1946–1949), after which he retired.

In 1950 he was appointed to the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] by National, as a member of the so-called [[Suicide squad (New Zealand)|suicide squad]] charged with voting for the abolition of the Council (or Upper House).
