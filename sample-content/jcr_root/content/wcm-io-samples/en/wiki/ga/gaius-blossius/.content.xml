        text="&lt;p&gt;:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This article is about the ally of Tiberius Gracchus.  For the Campanian family from which he descended, see [[Blossia (gens)]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gaius Blossius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (2nd century BC) was, according to [[Plutarch]], a [[philosopher]] and student of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Antipater of Tarsus]], from the city of [[Cumae]] in [[Campania]], [[Italy]], who (along with the [[Greece|Greek]] [[rhetoric]]ian, [[Diophanes]]) instigated [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[tribune]] [[Tiberius Gracchus]] to pursue a [[land reform]] movement on behalf of the [[plebs]]. Tiberius was accused by his political opponents of attempting to provoke a popular uprising, and have himself crowned King. Eventually, he was [[assassinated]], and his body thrown into the river [[Tiber]].

After the death of Tiberius Gracchus, Blossius was interrogated by the [[consul]]s on the matter. Blossius freely admitted that he had done anything Tiberius had asked. The consuls asked &amp;quot;What? What would you do if Tiberius ordered you to burn the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]]?&amp;quot;  He answered that Tiberius would never have given such an order. Being pressed on the point, though, Blossius eventually stated that Tiberius would only have ordered such a thing, if it were in the true interests of the Roman people. After that, he was released. Blossius went to the province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], where he took part in [[Eumenes III|Aristonicus]]&amp;apos; popular uprising against [[Rome]], aiding in the organization of the [[Heliopolis state]]. When the uprising was ultimately defeated, he killed himself.
