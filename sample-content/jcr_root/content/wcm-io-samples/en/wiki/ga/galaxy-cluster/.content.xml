A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;galaxy cluster&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a structure that consists of hundreds of galaxies bound by gravity.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Hubble protocluster&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Galaxy clusters are much larger than [[Galaxy groups and clusters|galaxy groups]]. One of the key features of clusters is the [[Intracluster medium]] or ICM. The ICM consists of gas between the galaxies and has a temperature on the order of 7-9 keV. Clusters of galaxies should not be confused with [[star cluster]]s such
as [[open cluster]]s, which are structures of stars &amp;apos;&amp;apos;within&amp;apos;&amp;apos; galaxies, as well as [[globular cluster]]s, which typically orbit galaxies.

Notable galaxy clusters in the relatively nearby Universe include the [[Virgo Cluster]], [[Fornax Cluster]], [[Hercules Cluster]], and the [[Coma Cluster]]. A very large aggregation of galaxies known as the [[Great Attractor]], dominated by the [[Norma Cluster]], is massive enough to affect the local expansion of the Universe ([[Hubble flow]]). Notable galaxy clusters in the distant, high-redshift Universe include [[SPT-CL J0546-5345]] and [[SPT-CL J2106-5844]], the most massive galaxy clusters found in the early Universe. In the last few decades, they are also found to be relevant sites of particle acceleration, a feature that has been discovered by the observing non-thermal diffuse radio emissions as [[radio halo]]s and [[radio relics]]. With [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] structures like [[cold front]], [[shock front]], [[Radio halo|minihalo]] have also been found in many galaxy clusters.

{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
Galaxy clusters typically have the following properties.
* They contain 50 to 1,000 galaxies, hot X-ray emitting gas and large amounts of [[dark matter]]. Details are described in the &amp;quot;Composition&amp;quot; section.
* The distribution of these three components is approximately the same in the cluster.
* They have total masses of 10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;14&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; to 10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;15&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; solar masses.
* They typically have a diameter from 2 to 10 Mpc (see [[1 E23 m|10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;23&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; m]] for distance comparisons).
* The spread of velocities for the individual galaxies is about 800–1000&amp;amp;nbsp;km/s.

==Composition==
There are three main components of a galaxy cluster. They are tabulated below:
{| class=&amp;quot;wikitable&amp;quot;
|-
! Name of the components
! Mass fraction
! Description
|-
| Galaxies
| 1%
| In optical observations only galaxies are visible
|-
| Intergalactic gas in [[Intracluster medium|ICM]]
| 9%
| Plasma between the galaxies at high temperature – emit x-ray radiation through thermal [[bremsstrahlung]] mechanism
|-
| Dark matter
| 90%
| Most massive component, cannot be detected optically, inferred through gravitational interactions
