&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gabriel Loubier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born September 27, 1932) was a politician in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. He served as leader of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; party from 1971 to 1974, and as [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Quebec)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] from 1971 to 1973.

Born in [[Thetford Mines|Black Lake, Quebec]], Loubier was first elected in [[Bellechasse (provincial electoral district)|Bellechasse]] in 1962 and became UN leader in July 1971, replacing former [[Premier of Quebec|Premier]] [[Jean-Jacques Bertrand]] as party leader and leader of the Opposition. From October 25, 1971, to January 14, 1973, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Union Nationale&amp;apos;&amp;apos; temporarily changed its name to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Unité Québec]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In the [[Quebec general election, 1973|1973 election]], the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Union Nationale&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was wiped off the electoral map, winning no seats, and Loubier ceased to be leader of the Opposition. He resigned as UN party leader in March 1974.
