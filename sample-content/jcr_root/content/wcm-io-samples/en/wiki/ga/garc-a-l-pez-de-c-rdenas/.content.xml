        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;García López de Cárdenas&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ([[Floruit|fl.]] 16th century), is credited with the first European discovery of the [[Grand Canyon]].

== Life ==

Cárdenas was born in [[Llerena]], [[Spain]], son to [[Alonso de Cárdenas]] y doña Elvira de Figueroa and Maria García Osorio. He was the comendador of [[Caravaca]].

López de Cárdenas was a [[conquistador]] attached to the exploits of [[Francisco Vasquez de Coronado]]. Expeditions, including one led by [[Pedro de Tobar]], had heard reports of a large river north of [[Cíbola]] (Zuñi). Cárdenas was dispatched in 1540 by the general stationed in Cíbola with the express mission of locating such a river and returning within 80 days. [[Pedro de Sotomayor]] accompanied him to record the event as a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;cronista&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. After some twenty days of marching in a northerly direction, he was successful; but his band found difficulties in reaching the river (called the [[River Tizon]]), owing to the sheer vertical distance down from their position. They were standing on the South Rim of the [[Grand Canyon]]. After several days of failed attempts to descend to the water (his men were suffering from thirst), his party was forced to return to Cíbola.
