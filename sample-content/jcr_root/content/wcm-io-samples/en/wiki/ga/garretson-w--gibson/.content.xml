&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Garritson Wilmaut Gibson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (20 May 1832 &amp;amp;ndash; 26 April 1910) was the [[President of Liberia#List of Presidents of Liberia|14th President of Liberia]] from 11 December 1900, to 4 January 1904. Born in [[Maryland]], in the [[United States]], his family emigrated to [[Liberia]] in 1835. After receiving an education in mission schools, he returned to Maryland to study theology. Ordained a [[priest]], he served as rector of the [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]] Trinity Church in [[Monrovia]]. He also served as Chaplain of the Liberian Senate. Later, he served as President of the Trustee Board of [[University of Liberia|Liberia College]] and at one time President of the College.

President Gibson began his political life as a Justice of the Peace. With the election of [[William D. Coleman (politician)|William D. Coleman]] as president in 1896, Gibson was appointed Secretary of the Interior. He was Secretary of State when Coleman resigned in 1900, and since there was no vice-president, Gibson was chosen to succeed him. He won the election that same year, and served until 1904, when his Secretary of the Treasury, [[Arthur Barclay]], succeeded him.

President Gibson died in [[Monrovia]] on April 26, 1910. He was the last Liberian president to have been born in the United States.

==Presidency (1900-1904)==

Prior to attaining the presidency, Gibson had had a long career in government including serving as Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of State.

In 1903, the British forced a concession of Liberian territory to Sierra Leone, but tension along that border remained high.

Whenever the British and French seemed intent on enlarging at Liberia&amp;apos;s expense the neighboring territories they already controlled, periodic appearances by U.S. warships helped discourage encroachment, even though successive American administrations rejected appeals from Monrovia for more forceful support.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Liebenow, J. Gus, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Liberia: the Quest for Democracy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1987&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
