The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Galena and Chicago Union Railroad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;G&amp;amp;CU&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was a [[railroad]] running west from [[Chicago]] to [[Clinton, Iowa]] and [[Freeport, Illinois]], never reaching [[Galena, Illinois]].  Incorporated in 1836, the G&amp;amp;CU became the first railroad built to Chicago.

==History==
The first railroad constructed out of Chicago, the Galena and Chicago Union, was chartered January 16, 1836, to connect Chicago with the lead mines at Galena.  &amp;quot;[[Pioneer (locomotive)|The Pioneer]],&amp;quot; the first locomotive on the road, arrived at Chicago on October 10, 1848, nearly thirteen years after the charter was granted. In 1850, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad was completed as far as [[Elgin, Illinois|Elgin]]. The railroad and the canal were vital in the development of Chicago and the population of the city tripled in the six years after the opening of the canal. Eventually other railroads were built and Chicago became the largest railroad center in the world.

In 1862 the G&amp;amp;CU leased in perpetuity the [[Cedar Rapids and Missouri Railroad]] which was to be the first railroad to reach [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] and the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]].  The G&amp;amp;CU consolidated with the [[Chicago and North Western Railway]] in 1864, which merged with the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] over a century later in 1996.

Today, the G&amp;amp;CU&amp;apos;s main line between Chicago and [[West Chicago]] is a busy commuter service, jointly operated by Union Pacific and Metra as the [[Union Pacific/West Line]].

==Construction==
The railroad was constructed starting in March 1848, and was completed in 1853. The first westbound train out of Chicago departed on October 25, 1848, pulled by a used [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]]-built locomotive named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pioneer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Rivanna Chapter, National Railway Historical Society (2005), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://avenue.org/nrhs/histoct.htm This Month in Railroad History - October]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
