        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gaja Alaga&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Lemeš, Bačka|Lemeš]], 1924 - [[Zagreb]], 1988) was a [[Croatia]]n theoretical [[physicist]] who specialised in [[nuclear physics]].

He was born in noble family of [[Bunjevac]] [[Croats]] in the village of Lemeš (today called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Svetozar Miletić&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) in northwestern [[Bačka]] in [[Kingdom of SHS]] (today in autonomous province [[Vojvodina]], [[Serbia]]).

He was an [[academician]] of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] since 1968 and a professor at the [[University of Zagreb]] [[Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Science]] ({{lang-hr|Prirodoslovno-matematički fakultet}}). He worked in the [[Ruđer Bošković Institute]] in [[Zagreb]] (the [[Capital (political)|capital]] city of [[Croatia]]), the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and [[Ludwig-Maximilians University]] in [[Munich]].

In 1955, cooperating with [[Kurt Alder]] and [[Ben Roy Mottelson]], Alaga discovered the [[K-selection rules]] and [[intensity rules]] for beta and gamma transitions in deformed atom nuclei. This discovery was key to the development of new nuclei models which confirmed that [[subatomic particles]] can distort the shape of the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. These models challenged [[Aage Bohr]], [[Ben Roy Mottelson]] and [[James Rainwater]]&amp;apos;s earlier (1975 [[Nobel Prize]]-winning) theory that the nucleus has a perfect spherical shape.

Also in 1955, the journal &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Physical Review&amp;apos;&amp;apos; published Alaga&amp;apos;s rules for beta and gamma transitions for heavily damaged atomic [[orbit]]s. Both discoveries are known as [[Alaga rules]], and are now in everyday use among nuclear scientists and in scientific literature.

He was the editor of the scientific magazine &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fizika&amp;apos;&amp;apos; from 1978 until his death in 1988.

He died in Zagreb in 1988. Today, a street in the [[Trnje]] city district of Zagreb bears his name.
