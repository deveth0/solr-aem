        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Galactic astronomy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the study of our own [[Milky Way]] galaxy and all its contents. This is in contrast to [[extragalactic astronomy]], which is the study of everything outside our galaxy, including all other galaxies.

Galactic astronomy should not be confused with [[galaxy formation and evolution]], which is the general study of [[galaxy|galaxies]], their formation, structure, components, dynamics, interactions, and the range of forms they take.

Our own [[Milky Way]] galaxy, where our [[solar system]] belongs, is in many ways the best studied galaxy, although important parts of it are obscured from view in visible [[wavelength]]s by regions of [[cosmic dust]]. The development of [[radio astronomy]], [[infrared astronomy]] and [[submillimetre astronomy]] in the 20th Century allowed the gas and dust of the Milky Way to be mapped for the first time.

== Subcategories ==
A standard set of subcategories is used by astronomical journals to split up the subject of Galactic Astronomy:{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}
# abundances – the study of the location of elements heavier than helium
# bulge – the study of the bulge around the center of the Milky Way
# center – the study of the central region of the Milky Way
# disk – the study of the Milky Way disk (the plane upon which most galactic objects are aligned)
# evolution – the evolution of the Milky Way
# formation – the formation of the Milky Way
# fundamental parameters – the fundamental parameters of the Milky Way (mass, size etc.)
# globular clusters – [[globular cluster]]s within the Milky Way
# halo – the large halo around the Milky Way
# kinematics and dynamics – the motions of stars and clusters
# nucleus – the region around the [[black hole]] at the center of the Milky Way ([[Sagittarius A*]])
# open clusters and associations – [[open cluster]]s and associations of stars
# solar neighbourhood – nearby stars
# stellar content – numbers and types of stars in the Milky Way
# structure – the structure (spiral arms etc.)

== Stellar populations ==
* [[Globular cluster]]s
* [[Open cluster]]s

== Interstellar medium ==
* [[Interplanetary space]] - [[Interplanetary medium]] - [[interplanetary dust]]
* [[Interstellar space]] - [[Interstellar medium]] - [[interstellar dust]]
* [[Intergalactic space]] - [[Intergalactic medium]] - [[Intergalactic dust]]
