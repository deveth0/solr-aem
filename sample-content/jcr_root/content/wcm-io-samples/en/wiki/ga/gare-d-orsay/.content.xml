&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gare d&amp;apos;Orsay&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a former [[Paris]] [[railway station]] and hotel, built in 1900 to designs by [[Victor Laloux]], [[Lucien Magne]] and [[Émile Bénard]]; it served as a terminus for the [[Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans]] (Paris-[[Orléans]] Railway). It was the first [[railway electrification|electrified]] urban [[rail terminal]] in the world, opened 28 May 1900, in time for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Exposition Universelle]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web

}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; After closure as a station, it reopened in December 1986 as the [[Musée d&amp;apos;Orsay]], an art museum. The museum is currently served by the [[Musée d&amp;apos;Orsay (Paris RER)|RER station of the same name]].

==History==

[[Image:Gare d&amp;apos;Orsay Clock 01-03-06.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the front of the old station showing one of the large clocks.]]
The site was occupied by the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[:fr:Palais d&amp;apos;Orsay|Palais d&amp;apos;Orsay]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, intended for the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d&amp;apos;État]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It was begun in 1810 but not completed until 1840, when its ground floor was occupied by the Council. In 1842 the [[Cour des Comptes]] was housed in the first floor. After the fall of the [[French Second Empire]] in 1870, the [[Paris Commune]] created a provisional commission to replace the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Conseil&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (March 1870 to August 1872), and the archives, library and works of art were removed to [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. Eventually both the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Conseil&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cour des Comptes&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were rehoused in the [[Palais-Royal]].

The largely empty Palais d&amp;apos;Orsay burned to a shell in a spectacular fire the night of 23–24 May 1871, which was vividly described by [[Emile Zola]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |last=Zola |first=Émile |authorlink=Émile Zola|year=1892 |publisher=Bibliothèque Charpentier |location=Paris |title=[[La Débâcle]] |language=French |trans_title=The Downfall |at=Part 3, chapter 8}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The site was purchased by the Compagnie Paris-Orléans, which erected the monumental station in [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style, which takes its name from the [[Quai d&amp;apos;Orsay]] on which it stands, as the terminus for the railways of southwestern France. The western and southern sides of the building included a 370-room hotel.

By 1939 the station&amp;apos;s short platforms had become unsuitable for the longer trains that had come to be used for mainline services, and the Gare d&amp;apos;Orsay was closed to long-distance traffic, though some [[suburban train]]s of the [[SNCF]] continue to use its lower levels to this day. The hotel closed at the beginning of 1973.

The former station was used as a collection point for the dispatch of parcels to [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] during the [[Second World War]], and after the war as a reception centre for liberated prisoners on their return; a plaque on the side of the building facing the [[River Seine]] commemorates this latter use.

It served as the setting for several films, including [[Orson Welles]]&amp;apos; version of [[Franz Kafka]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Trial (1962 film)|The Trial]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and is a central location in [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]&amp;apos;s [[The Conformist]]. It was in the ballroom of the station&amp;apos;s hotel that General [[Charles de Gaulle]] held the [[press conference]] at which he announced his &amp;quot;availability to serve his country&amp;quot; on 19 May 1958, ushering in the end of the French [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]].

In 1977 the French Government decided to convert the station to a museum. The building was listed as a historical monument in 1978 and re-opened as the [[Musée d&amp;apos;Orsay]] in December 1986. The chief architect for the conversion was the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Gae Aulenti]].  There is a huge clock which still works in the main terminal housing the museum.
