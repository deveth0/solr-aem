        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gaius Memmius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (incorrectly called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gemellus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;The Twin&amp;quot;), [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[orator]] and [[poet]], [[tribune]] of the people (66 BC), patron of [[Lucretius]] and acquaintance of [[Catullus]].

At first a strong supporter of [[Pompey]], he quarrelled with him, and went over to [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], whom he had previously attacked. In 54, as candidate for the consulship, he lost Caesar&amp;apos;s support by revealing a scandalous transaction in which he and his fellow candidate had been implicated.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Cicero]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ad Alt.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; iv. 15-18.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Being subsequently condemned for illegal practices at the election, he withdrew to [[Athens]], and afterwards, to [[Mytilene]]. He died about the year 49. He is remembered chiefly because it was to him that Lucretius addressed the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[De rerum natura]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, perhaps with the idea of making him a convert to the doctrines of [[Epicurus]]. It appears from Cicero&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ad Fam.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; xiii. 1.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; that he possessed an estate on which were the ruins of Epicurus&amp;apos; house, and that he had determined to build on the site a house for himself. According to [[Ovid]]&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Trist.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ii. 433.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; he was the author of erotic poems. He possessed considerable oratorical abilities, but his contempt for Latin letters and preference for Greek models impaired his efficiency as an advocate.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Cicero]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Brutus (Cicero)|Brutus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 70.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Gaius Memmius was married to [[Cornelia Fausta]], the daughter of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lucretius (c.99â€”c.55 BCE)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [http://www.iep.utm.edu/lucretiu/ Internet Enclyclopedia of Philosophy]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; They had at least one son, [[Gaius Memmius (consul 34 BC)|Gaius Memmius]], [[suffect consul]] in 34 BC.
