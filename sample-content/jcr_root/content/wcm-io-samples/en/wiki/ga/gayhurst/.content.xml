&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gayhurst&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[Milton Keynes (borough)|Borough of Milton Keynes]], ceremonial [[Buckinghamshire#Ceremonial County|Buckinghamshire]] in  [[England]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.milton-keynes.gov.uk/parishes/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=17026 Parishes in Milton Keynes] - Milton Keynes Council.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is about two and a half miles NNW of [[Newport Pagnell]].

The village name is an [[Old English language]] word meaning &amp;apos;wooded hill where goats are kept&amp;apos;.  In the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086 it was recorded as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gateherst&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  At that time the [[Manorialism|manor]] was owned by [[Bishop]] [[Odo of Bayeux]].

Gayhurst had an outstation from the [[Bletchley Park]] codebreaking establishment, where some of the [[Bombe]]s used to decode German [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] messages in World War Two were housed.

[[Gayhurst House]] is reputed to have once belonged to [[Sir Francis Drake]] although it is not known whether he ever lived there, and for many years the gatehouse leading to the estate was a public house called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Francis Drake&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The house certainly once belonged to the father-in-law of Sir [[Everard Digby]] (1578–1606), one of the conspirators in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605, and he resided there for some time.

The church of St Peter was built in the classical style in 1728 to replace a medieval church; the designer is unknown.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Betjeman, J. (ed.) (1968) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Collins Pocket Guide to English Parish Churches: the South&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. London: Collins; p. 127&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
