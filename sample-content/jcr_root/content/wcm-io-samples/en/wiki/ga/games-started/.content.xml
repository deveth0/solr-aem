A pitcher is credited with starting the game if he faces the first opposing batter. If a player is listed in the starting lineup as the team&amp;apos;s pitcher, but is replaced before facing an opposing batter, the player is credited with a game pitched but not a game started; there have been instances in [[Major League Baseball|major league]] history in which a starting pitcher was removed before his first pitch due to an injury, perhaps suffered while [[batting (baseball)|batting]] or [[baserunning|running the bases]] during the top half of the first inning.

The all-time leader for games started is [[Cy Young]] with 815 over a 22-year career. The current leader among active players is [[Jamie Moyer]]. The players with the most starts in a single season are [[Pud Galvin]] and [[Will White]], each with 75 games started [http://www.baseball-almanac.com/pitching/pigstar1.shtml].
