&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gabriele Pasquale Giuseppe Rossetti&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (28 February 1783, [[Vasto]], [[Abruzzo]] â€“ 24 April 1854) was an Italian poet and scholar who emigrated to England.

Born in [[Vasto]] in the [[Two Sicilies|Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], the original family of his ancestors was Della Guardia. Since many members of the Della Guardia family had red hair, they were given the nickname Rossetti approximately four generations before Gabriele&amp;apos;s birth.&amp;lt;ref name=Rossetti&amp;gt;Rossetti,Gabriele and William Michael Rossetti. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gabriele Rossetti: An Autobiography&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Sands (1901)p.7&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Rossetti&amp;apos;s support for Italian revolutionary nationalism forced him into political [[exile]] in 1821.

==Early career and exile==
Rossetti&amp;apos;s first edition of poems was printed in 1807 by Giovanni Avalloni, who offered to have Rossetti&amp;apos;s poems published after hearing him recite a few passages. The volume was never reprinted and contains poems that Rossetti himself describes by saying that some of them were &amp;quot;poor&amp;quot; and none of them were &amp;quot;exactly good&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Rossetti p. 15&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Throughout his early career, Rossetti published poems that were &amp;quot;patriotic&amp;quot; and supported the &amp;quot;popular movement&amp;quot; in Sicily which resulted in him receiving a grant from Ferdinand I of [[Naples]] in 1820. When the king revoked the [[constitution]] in 1821, many supporters of the constitution were persecuted and forced into exile, and  Rossetti then lived in [[Malta]] for three years before settling in London in 1824. He held the post of Professor of Italian at [[King&amp;apos;s College London]] from 1831, as well as teaching Italian at [[King&amp;apos;s College School]], until failing eyesight led to his retirement in 1847.&amp;lt;ref name=Rossetti2&amp;gt;Rossettie, Dante Gabriel. William Michael Rossetti, Mark Twain, Clara Clemens. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Poetical Works of Dante Gabriel Rosseti&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Ellis and Elvey, (1893)p.xvi&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Rossetti&amp;apos;s published works include literary criticism, [[Romantic poetry]] such as his long poem &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Il veggente in solitudine&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of 1846, and his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Autobiography&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  He is thought to be the basis of the character Pesca in [[Wilkie Collins]]&amp;apos; 1860 novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Woman in White]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

He married [[Frances Polidori]], daughter of another Italian exile [[Gaetano Polidori]], and they had four children:
* [[Maria Francesca Rossetti]]
* [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]
* [[William Michael Rossetti]]
* [[Christina Rossetti|Christina Georgina Rossetti]]
