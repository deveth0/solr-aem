&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gardeners&amp;apos; Question Time&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a long-running [[BBC Radio 4]] programme in which amateur [[gardening|gardeners]] can put questions to a panel of experts.

==History==
The first programme was broadcast from the &amp;apos;Singing Room&amp;apos; at the Broadoak Hotel, [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] on 9 April 1947. Originally named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;How Does Your Garden Grow?&amp;apos;&amp;apos; it was inspired by the wartime [[Victory garden|Dig For Victory]] campaign. On the first panel were [[Bill Sowerbutts]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.tameside.gov.uk/corpgen2/billsower.htm Blue Plaque - Bill Sowerbutts&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Fred Loads, Tom Clark and Dr E.W.Sansome.

Professor Alan Gemmell joined Loads and Sowerbutts in 1950 when their contrasting styles (Professor, Traditional Head gardener and Commercial Grower) added an entertainment element. The successful format allowed it to broadcast nationally from 1957 in the light entertainment slot on Sunday afternoons. The programme marked its 1000th edition in 1972, though the occasion was overshadowed by the death of long-serving chairman [[Franklin Engelmann]] just days earlier.

The format and panel were largely unchanged for many years. In 1994 the complete panel left the BBC and they moved to the new [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]] station on a short-term contract as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Classic Gardening Forum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; with sponsorship by The [[Cheltenham and Gloucester]] [[Building Society]].  In 2009 the production of the show was taken over by the UK&amp;apos;s largest independent radio production company [[Somethin&amp;apos; Else Sound Directions Ltd.|Somethin&amp;apos; Else]]. In December 2009 panellist [[John Cushnie]] died suddenly.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8437119.stm BBC News - Gardeners&amp;apos; Question Time star John Cushnie dies&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The programme&amp;apos;s audience figures continue to perform strongly as confirmed by the official audience measurement body, RAJAR.

==Format==
The programme typically comes from a village hall or other public venue somewhere in Britain, or occasionally further afield, such as in the [[Republic of Ireland]] or northern [[France]]. There are also regular editions in which the panel answer questions sent in by [[Mail|post]] or [[email]]. These editions are recorded in a specially adapted potting shed at [[Sparsholt College, Hampshire|Sparsholt College]] near [[Sparsholt, Hampshire|Sparsholt]], [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]]; where the regular panel members also maintain a small demonstration garden, curated by Rosie Yeomans.

Since 2001, GQT factsheets have been made available after each episode covering all questions and their given answers.

In July 2009 publication of the programme as a podcast began.

==Panelists==
The current joint-chairmen are [[Eric Robson]] and  [[Peter Gibbs]].  Current panelists include: Matthew Wilson, [[Chris Beardshaw]], [[Matthew Biggs]], [[Bob Flowerdew]], [[Pippa Greenwood]], [[Bunny Guinness]], [[Anne Swithinbank]], [[Christine Walkden]].

Past participants have included John Cushnie, Dr [[Stefan Buczacki]], [[David Burges]], [[Fred Downham]],  Professor [[Alan Gemmell]], [[Walter Gilmore]], [[Jill Hicking]], [[Clay Jones]], [[Nigel Colborn]], [[Daphne Ledward]], [[Fred Loads]], [[Bridget Moody]], [[Martin Fish]], David Jones, [[Sue Phillipps]], [[Geoffrey Smith (gardener)|Geoffrey Smith]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7916174.stm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Sid Robertson]], [[Bill Sowerbutts]]

Past Chairmen were [[Bob Stead]], [[Franklin Engelmann]], [[Michael Barratt (television presenter)|Michael Barratt]], [[Steve Race]], Ken Ford, [[Les Cottingham]],  [[Clay Jones]], [[Stefan Buczacki]]
