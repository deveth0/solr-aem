&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;GameDev.net&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[website]] dedicated to [[game development]], founded by Kevin Hawkins, Dave Astle, and Michael Tanczos among others, in 1999. It serves as a central trade resource and media outlet for the [[computer and video game industry]], with particular regards to [[independent game development|hobbyist and independent developers]].  The site features daily news, articles, forums, job listings, product reviews, book reviews, contests, and regular columns.  The site contains many tutorials for hobbyists and professionals alike with a noticeable focus on computer programming. GameDev.net is visited by a variety of people, including both professionals and hobbyists, and has a highly active user base.  Previous site wide polls indicate that the site&amp;apos;s demographics are predominately male, with roughly 44.5% of its user base being under 21, and 44.1% of its user base in the 22-30 range. The site also has a popular [[Internet forum|forum]] which boasts advanced topics ranging from [[artificial intelligence]] and [[DirectX]] programming to the off-topic lounge.

==4 Elements contest==
GameDev.net hosts a well known annual competition known as the &amp;quot;4 Elements&amp;quot; contest, which typically starts September of each year and lasts 6 months. It is a sponsored game development competition that requires the contenders to create a game based on 4 elements (revealed before the start of the competition).  The contest was originally created around the [[classical elements]], although the focus of the contest has since shifted to random and seemingly unrelated elements to encourage innovations in [[game play]] rather than graphics.

==GDNet+==
GameDev.net offers a number of services to paying members, under the [[brand name]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;GDNet+&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Among the offered services are [[blog|developer journals]], [[web hosting]], and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;GDNet Showcase&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a service for hosting downloadable games created by members.

==Hosted sites==
Beyond itself, GameDev.net also hosts a number of other game development sites. The most popular of the hosted sites are [http://nehe.gamedev.net NeHe], a comprehensive, but outdated suite of [[OpenGL]] [[tutorials]] originally written by Jeff &amp;quot;NeHe&amp;quot; Molofee, and [http://nexe.gamedev.net NeXe], a wiki-based website on DirectX containing various tutorials and other information. Also hosted is the [http://wiki.gamedev.net Game Development Wiki] (formerly the Game Programming Wiki).
