==Biography==
He was born into an Armenian banker&amp;apos;s family in [[Samarkand]], [[Uzbekistan]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. His father, Arshak (Russified to Arkadi) Ureklyan, fled to [[Tiflis]] from the Ottoman-ruled Armenia in 1890s, and subsequently moved to Samarkand. He took the [[Bolshevik]] side during the [[Russian Civil War]] and the subsequent Soviet takeover of [[Central Asia]]. Embarking on a career as a reporter and writer, he adopted the nickname El-Registan, which was composed of a part of his first name and the Samarkand&amp;apos;s most famous landmark, [[Registan]]. He worked in several prominent Central Asian newspapers, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pravda Vostoka]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Tashkent]]. He achieved prominence as a talented reporter and was invited to move to Moscow to work for the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Izvestia]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. From there, he covered the massive Soviet construction and heavy industry-building campaigns  and became a prominent propagandist, such as the [[White Sea – Baltic Canal]], [[Uralmash]], etc. He also wrote movie scripts and radio plays, and El-Registan is perhaps better known for his script of the Soviet film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Djulbars&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1935).

After the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, El-Registan became a special [[war correspondent]], frequently traveling to front lines. He attracted the attention of [[Joseph Stalin]], and when he submitted his draft of the new Soviet anthem, written in collaboration with [[Sergey Mikhalkov]], Stalin personally chose the draft and instructed the authors on the changes to be made. Eventually, it was adopted as the [[National Anthem of the Soviet Union]] in 1944.

He was married to [[Valentina Galanina]], an actress in Moscow. El-Registan died in Moscow and is buried in the [[Novodevichye Cemetery]].
