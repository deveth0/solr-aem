A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gallery grave&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a form of [[Megalithic]] tomb where there is no size difference between the burial chamber itself and the entrance passage. Two parallel walls of stone slabs were erected to form a corridor and covered with a line of capstones. The rectangular tomb was covered with a [[tumulus|barrow]] or a [[cairn]]. Most were built during the fourth millennium BC, though some were still being built in the [[Bronze Age]].

They are distributed across [[Europe]] and they are usually subdivided  by period, region and also into more generic types of [[chambered long barrow]]s, [[chambered round barrow]]s, [[chambered long cairn]]s and [[chambered round cairn]]s. Examples are known in [[Catalonia]], [[France]], the [[Low Countries]], [[Germany]], The [[British Isles]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Sardinia]] and southern [[Italy]].

Sub-types include:

*[[Court Cairn]]s
* [[Giants&amp;apos; grave]]s
* [[Naveta]]s
* the [[Peak District tomb group]]
*[[Severn-Cotswold tomb|Severn-Cotswold]] or Cotswold-Severn tombs
*[[Seine-Oise-Marne culture]] allées couvertes
*[[Transepted gallery grave]]s
*[[Wedge-shaped gallery grave]]s
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wartberg culture|Hessisch-westfälische Steinkisten]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Galleriegräber)
