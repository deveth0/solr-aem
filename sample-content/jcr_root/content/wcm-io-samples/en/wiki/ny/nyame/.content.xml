&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nyame&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nyambe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nyankopon&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is the [[List of sky deities|Sky deity]] of the [[Akan people]] of [[Ghana]], the leader of the Abosom, the Akan [[spirit]]s and minor gods.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=Who&amp;apos;s who in non-classical mythology |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors=Egerton Sykes, Alan Kendall |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0-415-26040-X, 9780415260404 |page=144 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xlRaVT1DOW8C&amp;amp;pg=PA146&amp;amp;dq=%22Ashanti+mythology%22&amp;amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Ashanti&amp;amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

His name means &amp;quot;he who does not speak&amp;quot; in the [[Luyana language]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Lozi peoples of north-western Rhodesia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by Victor Witter Turner&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Function==
He is called &amp;quot;king of the [[Lozi people]]&amp;quot; and [[Lozi mythology|it is said]] that he was a maker of animals, forests and birds.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.royalark.net/Zambia/lozi2.htm Family tree of Litungas]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Nyame is portrayed as a benevolent god, if sometime aloof and distant. The [[sun]] is his right eye, which he open during the day, while the [[moon]] is his left eye.

One of Nyame&amp;apos;s creations was Kamunu, the first human being. Nyame gave Kamunu the task of naming all the other creations.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/afr/mlb/mlb04.htm Origin of death]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Harold Scheub]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nyambe And The Origin of Death&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. A Dictionary of African Mythology, [[Oxford University Press]], 2000&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Family==
Mother of Nyame was named Ngula. She was a goddess created by her own son.

His divine wife is [[Asase Ya]], goddess of earth and fate and they have two children: Tano, [[river]] god of [[war]] and Bia, god of wild animals (he is also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bea&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;African Mythology, A to Z&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Patricia Ann Lynch]], [[Jeremy Roberts]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Also the son or servant and herald of Nyame is [[Anansi]], the Spider [[Trickster]] god, bringer of knowledge and stories.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;See [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/11/sfg/ho_1986.475a-c.htm#|this Ashanti linguist staff finial.]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

His mortal queens were Nasilele, Mwambwa and Mbuymamwambwa and his mortal sons were chiefs [[Yeta I]], [[Mwanasolundwi Muyunda Mumbo wa Mulonga]], [[Inyambo]] and [[Ingulamwa]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.royalark.net/Zambia/lozi2.htm Family tree of Litungas]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

After Nyame returned to heaven, Nasilele died a few weeks later.

==Nyame and Anansi==

Nyame gave Anansi his stories in exchange for gifts, and then charged the spider-god to walk the world and find new stories.
