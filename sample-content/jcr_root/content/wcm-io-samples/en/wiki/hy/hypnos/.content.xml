In [[Greek mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hypnos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;theoi&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; ({{Lang-grc|Ὕπνος}}, &amp;quot;sleep&amp;quot;) was the personification of sleep; the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent was known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Somnus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;theoi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Hypnos.html Theoi Project: Hypnos].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; His twin was [[Thánatos]] (Θάνατος, &amp;quot;death&amp;quot;); their mother was the primordial goddess [[Nyx]] (Νύξ, &amp;quot;night&amp;quot;). His palace was a dark cave where the sun never shone. At the entrance were a number of poppies and other [[hypnogogic]] plants. His dwelling had no door or gate so that he might not be awakened by the creaking of hinges.

Hypnos&amp;apos; three sons or brothers represented things that occur in dreams (the [[Oneiroi]]). [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]], [[Phobetor]] and [[Phantasos]] appeared in the dreams of kings. According to one story, Hypnos lived in a cave underneath a [[Greece|Greek]] island; through this cave flowed [[Lethe]], the river of forgetfulness.

[[Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]], sentenced by Zeus to eternal sleep, received the power to sleep with his eyes open. He was granted this by Hypnos in order to constantly watch his beloved [[Selene]], according to the poet, Licymnius Chios. Other stories &amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;licymnius&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[https://www.gaiaonline.com/guilds/viewtopic.php?t=20698427 Licymnius, Fragment 771 (from Athenaeus, Scholars at Dinner) (trans. Campbell, Vol. Greek Lyric V) (Greek lyric 4th century BC)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;theoi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Hypnos.html Theoi]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; suggest, Hypnos fell in love with Endymion and granted him the power to sleep with his eyes open so Hypnos could watch Endymion without interruption.

In art, Hypnos was portrayed as a naked youthful man, sometimes with a beard, and wings attached to his head. He is sometimes shown as a man asleep on a bed of feathers with black curtains about him. [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]] is his chief minister and prevents noises from waking him. In [[Sparta]], the image of Hypnos was always put near that of [[death]].

The English word &amp;quot;hypnosis&amp;quot; is derived from his name, referring to the fact that when hypnotized, a person is put into a sleep-like state (hypnos &amp;quot;sleep&amp;quot; + -osis &amp;quot;condition&amp;quot;).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hypnosis?s=t Dictionary.com: Hypnosis].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Additionally, the English word &amp;quot;insomnia&amp;quot; comes from the name of his Latin counterpart, Somnus. (in- &amp;quot;not&amp;quot; + somnus &amp;quot;sleep&amp;quot;),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/insomnia?s=t Dictionary.com: Insomnia].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; as well as a few less-common words such as &amp;quot;somnolent&amp;quot;, meaning sleepy or tending to cause sleep.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/somnolent?s=t Dictionary.com: Somnolent].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
