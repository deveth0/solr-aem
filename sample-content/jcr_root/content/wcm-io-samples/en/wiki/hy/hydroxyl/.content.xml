[[File:Hydroxyl3D.png|thumb|right|200px|Representation of an [[organic compound|organic]] hydroxyl group, where R represents a [[hydrocarbon]] or other organic moiety, the red and grey spheres represent oxygen and hydrogen atoms, respectively, and the rod-like connections between these, [[covalent]] [[chemical bond]]s.]]

A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;hydroxyl&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[chemistry|chemical]] [[functional group]] containing an [[oxygen]] atom connected by a [[covalent bond]] to a [[hydrogen]] [[atom]], a pairing that can be simply understood as a substructure of the [[water]] [[molecule]]. When it appears, it imparts to chemical structures some of the reactive and interactive properties of the -OH of water ([[Ionization|ionizability]], [[hydrogen bond]]ing, etc.). The neutral form of the hydroxyl group is a [[hydroxyl radical]]. The [[anion]] form, (OH&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;−&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) is called the [[hydroxide]] anion; it bears a single negative charge largely residing on the more [[electronegative]] oxygen.

==Hydroxyl group==
The hydroxyl group is prevalent in [[organic chemistry]], where it is the defining [[functional group]] in [[alcohol]]s. It appears throughout organic chemical structure and biochemical structure in [[sugar]]s and some [[amino acid]]s and [[phospholipid]]s, and so in all biological barriers ([[biological membrane]]s and [[cell wall]]s). One cannot overstate its centrality in all chemistry, especially because of its necessary targeting in [[organic synthesis]], its roles in [[enzyme]] [[catalysis]] and [[enzyme inhibition| inhibition]], and in the formation of biological structures, all because of its [[hydrogen bond]]ing capability. This capability underlies protein-ligand interactions, and imparts water solubility and internal structural stability to [[macromolecule]]

==Hydroxyl radical==
{{main|Hydroxyl radical}}
Hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive and undergo chemical reactions that make them short-lived. When biological systems are exposed to hydroxyl radicals, they can cause damage to cells, including those in humans, where they react with DNA, lipids, and proteins.

==Lunar and other extraterrestrial observations==
In 2009,  India&amp;apos;s [[Chandrayaan-1]] satellite, NASA&amp;apos;s [[Cassini spacecraft]] and the [[Deep Impact probe]] have each detected the presence of water by evidence of hydroxyl fragments on the Moon. As reported by Richard Kerr, &amp;quot;A [[spectrometer]] (the Moon Mineralogy Mapper, aka &amp;quot;M3&amp;quot;), detected an infrared absorption at a wavelength of 3.0 micrometers that only water or hydroxyl—a hydrogen and an oxygen bound together—could have created.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|author=A Whiff of Water Found on the Moon |url=http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/924/1 |title=A Whiff of Water Found on the Moon - ScienceNOW |publisher=Sciencenow.sciencemag.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-22}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[NASA]] also reported in 2009 that the [[LCROSS]] probe revealed an [[ultraviolet]] emission spectrum consistent with hydroxyl presence.&amp;lt;ref name=nasa&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LCROSS/main/prelim_water_results.html |title=LCROSS Impact Data Indicates Water on Moon |accessdate=2009-11-14 |publisher=[[NASA]]}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The [[Venus Express]] orbiter has been continuously sending back [[Venus]] science data since April 11, 2006. Results from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Venus Express&amp;apos;&amp;apos; include the detection of hydroxyl in the atmosphere.
