[[File:Typhoonsizes.jpg|thumb|The relative sizes of [[Typhoon Tip]], [[Cyclone Tracy]], and the [[United States]].]]

In order to form a hypercane, according to Emanuel&amp;apos;s hypothetical model, the ocean temperature would have to be 48°C (120°F).  Although such a storm would also be quite small in area as compared to hurricanes, perhaps only {{convert|25|km2|mi2}}, it would extend much further into the upper [[stratosphere]]; present day hurricanes extend into only the lower stratosphere.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite interview |first=Kerry |last=Emanuel |title=Hypercane |work=Mega Disasters |publisher=History Channel |date=2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Hypercanes would have wind speeds of over {{convert|800|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, and would also have a central pressure of less than {{convert|70|kPa|inHg|lk=on}} (700 millibars), giving them an enormous lifespan.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;MIT&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; For comparison, the largest and most intense storm on record was 1979&amp;apos;s [[Typhoon Tip]], with a wind speed of {{convert|305|km/h|mph}} and central pressure of {{convert|87|kPa|inHg|lk=on}} (870 millibars).  Such a storm would be eight times more powerful than the strongest storms yet recorded.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite interview |first=Robert |last=Henson |title=Hypercane |work=Mega Disasters |publisher=History Channel |date=2008}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The extreme conditions needed to create a hypercane could conceivably produce a system up to the size of [[North America]], creating [[storm surge]]s of {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an eye nearly {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} across. The waters could remain hot enough for weeks, allowing more hypercanes to be formed. A hypercane&amp;apos;s clouds would reach {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} into the [[stratosphere]]. Such an intense storm would also damage the Earth&amp;apos;s [[ozone]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;MIT&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; Water molecules in the stratosphere would react with [[ozone]] to accelerate decay into O&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; and reduce absorption of [[ultraviolet light]].
