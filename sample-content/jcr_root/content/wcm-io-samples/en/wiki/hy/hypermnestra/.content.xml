&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hypermnestra&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang|grc|Ὑπερμνήστρα}}: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the much wooed one&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;the one wooed by many&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), in [[Greek mythology]], is the daughter of [[Danaus]] and the ancestor of the [[Danaids]].

==The Danaid==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hypermnestra&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the daughter of [[Danaus]]. Danaus was the twin brother of [[Aegyptus]] and son of [[Belus (Egyptian)|Belus]]. He had fifty daughters, [[the Danaides]], and Aegyptus had fifty sons. Aegyptus commanded that his sons marry the Danaides and Danaus fled to [[Argos]], ruled by King [[Pelasgus]]. When Aegyptus and his sons arrived to take the Danaides, Danaus gave them to spare the Argives the pain of a battle. However, he instructed his daughters to kill their husbands on their wedding night. Forty-nine followed through, but one, Hypermnestra refused because her husband, [[Lynceus]],&amp;lt;ref Name=&amp;quot;Smith&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book  | last =William Smith, Mahmoud Saba  | title =Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (volume II)  | publisher =Walton and Maberly  | year =1857  | location =Original from the University of Michigan  | pages =231  | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=tJIfAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA231&amp;amp;dq=Lyrcus&amp;amp;ie=ISO-8859-1  | doi =    }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; honored her wish to remain a virgin. Danaus was angry with his disobedient daughter and threw her to the Argive courts. [[Aphrodite]] intervened and saved her. Lynceus later killed Danaus as revenge for the death of his brothers. Lynceus and Hypermnestra then began a dynasty of Argive kings (the [[List_of_kings_of_Argos#Danaid_Dynasty|Danaid Dynasty]]), beginning with [[Abas (son of Lynceus)|Abas]]. In some versions of the legend, the Danaides were punished in the underworld by being forced to carry water through a jug with holes, or a sieve, so the water always leaked out.  Hypermnestra, however, went straight to [[Elysium]].
