        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oxford Classical Dictionary&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;OCD&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is considered{{by whom|date=September 2012}} to be the standard one-volume [[encyclopaedia]] in [[English language|English]] of topics relating to the [[Ancient World]] and its civilizations.  It was first published in 1949 (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;OCD1&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), edited by [[Max Cary]] with the assistance of H. J. Rose, H. P. Harvey, and A. Souter.  A second edition followed in 1970 (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;OCD2&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), edited by [[Nicholas G. L. Hammond]] and [[H. H. Scullard]], and a third edition in 1996 (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;OCD3&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), edited by [[Simon Hornblower]] and [[Antony Spawforth]]. A revised third edition was released in 2003, which is nearly identical to the previous third edition. Finally, a fourth edition was published in 2012 (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;OCD4&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), edited by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth with the assistance of Esther Eidinow, which remains the current edition. This most recent edition is marked principally by three features: first, revision to the text of approximately half the entries; second, 90 new or replaced entries (19 replaced); and, third, thoroughly updated bibliographies for each entry.

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;OCD&amp;apos;s&amp;apos;&amp;apos; over 6,700 articles cover everything from the daily life of the ancient Greeks and Romans to their [[geography]], [[religion]], and their historical figures. The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;OCD&amp;apos;&amp;apos; includes references to sources and recent scholarly publications.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
