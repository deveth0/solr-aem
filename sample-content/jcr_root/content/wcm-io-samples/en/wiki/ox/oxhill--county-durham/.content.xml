&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oxhill&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small village in [[County Durham]], in [[England]]. It is located to the west of [[Stanley, County Durham|Stanley]], on the bottom of the hill which leads up to [[Annfield Plain]].   Down the hill to the north are [[East Kyo]] and [[Harperley]].   Oxhill contains very little: a few households, a pub called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Ox&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the main [[nursery school]] for the Stanley area.

Oxhill used to be the site of a major level crossing, allowing access from the former nearby [[Stanhope and Tyne Railway]] line to a shunting yard adjacent to nearby [[South Moor]], where coal was loaded for transport to the [[River Tyne]] for export.
