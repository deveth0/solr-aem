&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oxhill&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[village]] in South [[Warwickshire]], [[England]], off the [[A422 road]] between [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] and [[Banbury]]. It lies in the administrative [[Districts of England|district]] of [[Stratford-on-Avon (district)|Stratford-on-Avon]] in the area known as the [[Vale of the Red Horse]]. The village is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] as &amp;quot;Octeselve&amp;quot; and has a 12th-century [[church (building)|church]] dedicated to [[Saint Lawrence]].

The indentions in the [[chancel]] window [[mullion]]s are believed by many to be the marks made by local archers sharpening their [[arrowhead]]s. Because of the holiness and sacredness of the church, the blessed arrows were also presumed to have divine accuracy.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Drogin, Marc. 1989. Biblioclasm: The Mythical Origins. Savage, Maryland: Rowman and Littlefield. Pages 32-33.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the graveyard of St Lawrence there is what is believed to be the only slave&amp;apos;s grave in Warwickshire, that of a negro slave called Myrtilla.
