        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Voir dire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|w|ɑr|_|ˌ|d|i|ər}} is a legal phrase that refers to a variety of procedures connected with jury trials.  It originally referred to an oath taken by jurors to tell the truth ([[Latin]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;verum dicere&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), i.e., to say what is true, what is objectively accurate or subjectively honest, or both. It comes from the [[Anglo-Norman language]].

The word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;voir&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;voire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), in this combination, comes from [[Old French]] and derives from Latin &amp;apos;&amp;apos;verum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;that which is true&amp;quot;. It is not related to the [[French language|modern French]] word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;voir&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which derives from Latin &amp;apos;&amp;apos;vidēre&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;to see&amp;quot;), though the expression is now often interpreted by [[false etymology]] to mean &amp;quot;to see [them] say&amp;quot;.

==Historic use==

In earlier centuries, a challenge to a particular juror would be tried by other members of the jury panel, and the challenged juror would take an oath of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;voir dire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, meaning to tell the truth.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Blackstone&amp;apos;s Commentaries, vol. 3 p. 364.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This procedure fell into disuse when the function of trying challenges to jurors was transferred to the judge.

==Use in Commonwealth countries==

In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada (and sometimes in the United States of America) it refers to a &amp;quot;trial within a trial&amp;quot;.  It is a hearing to determine the [[admissible evidence|admissibility of evidence]], or the competency of a witness or juror.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/V/Voirdire.aspx |title=Voir Dire definition |last1= Duhaime |first1=Lloyd |work=Duhaime&amp;apos;s Legal Dictionary |publisher=Duhaime.org |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; As the subject matter of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;voir dire&amp;apos;&amp;apos; often relates to evidence, competence or other matters that may lead to bias on behalf of the [[jury]], the jury may be removed from the court for the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;voir dire&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The term has thus been broadened in Australian jurisdictions to include any hearing during a trial where the jury is removed. The [[High Court of Australia]] has noted that the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;voir dire&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an appropriate forum for the trial judge to reprimand [[legal counsel|counsel]] or for counsel to make submissions as to the running of the court to the trial judge.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://netk.net.au/Australia/Jago.asp |title=&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jago v The District Court of NSW and others&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1989) HCA 46 |last1= Moles |first1=Robert N. |last2= |first2= Sangha Bibi |date=3 May 2007 |publisher=Networked Knowledge |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the United States and Canada, it now generally refers to the process by which prospective jurors are questioned about their backgrounds and potential biases before being [[jury selection|chosen to sit on a jury]]. &amp;quot;Voir Dire is the process by which attorneys select, or perhaps more appropriately reject, certain jurors to hear a case.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=Trial Evidence Foundations |last1= Cleary |first1=Gordon P. |last2= Tarantino |first2=John A. |year= 2007 |publisher=James Publishing |location=Santa Ana, Calif. |at=Section 201 |url=http://www.jamespublishing.com/books/tef.htm}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  It also refers to the process by which [[expert witness]]es are questioned about their backgrounds and qualifications before being allowed to present their opinion testimony in court. As noted above, in the United States (especially in practice under the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]]), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;voir dire&amp;apos;&amp;apos; can also refer to examination of the background of a witness to assess their qualification or fitness to give testimony on a given subject.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |title= Evidence |last1= Mueller |first1=Christopher B. |last2= Kirkpatrick |first2=Laird C. |edition=4th |year= 2009 |series=Aspen Treatise Series |publisher=Aspen Publishers |location=New York |isbn= 978-0-7355-7967-5 |at=§§6.2, 6.59, 7.14 |oclc=300280544}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Each of these types of voir dire are taught to law students in [[Trial Advocacy]] courses.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Lubet, Steven; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Modern Trial Advocacy,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; NITA 2004 pp. 240, 541&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
