==History==
Vogošća greatly prospered during the 1980s, as part of Sarajevo’s great boom in the latter half of the 20th century. It grew to prominence in large part due to its [[automotive industry|automobile]] [[manufacturing]] [[industry]], having deals with [[Germany|German]] and [[Sweden|Swedish]] companies, including [[Volkswagen Group]].  By the late 1980s, it was the second most industrious and productive municipality in [[former Yugoslavia]].

Vogošća was heavily damaged during the exodus of the Serbs who controlled that territory during the war.  The Dayton Agreement provided Vogošća to be a part of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].  Today, Vogošća is rebuilding and its industries are on the rebound thanks to aid and funds.
