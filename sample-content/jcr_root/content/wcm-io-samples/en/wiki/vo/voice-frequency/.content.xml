        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;voice frequency&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (VF) or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;voice band&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of the frequencies, within part of the [[Sound|audio]] range, that is used for the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[Speech communication|speech]].

In [[telephony]], the usable [[human voice|voice]] frequency band ranges from approximately 300&amp;amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] to 3400&amp;amp;nbsp;Hz. It is for this reason that the [[ultra low frequency]] band of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] between 300 and 3000&amp;amp;nbsp;Hz is also referred to as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;voice frequency&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, being the electromagnetic energy that represents acoustic energy at [[baseband]]. The [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] allocated for a single voice-frequency transmission [[channel (communications)|channel]] is usually 4&amp;amp;nbsp;kHz, including [[guard band]]s, allowing a [[sampling rate]] of 8&amp;amp;nbsp;kHz to be used as the basis of the [[pulse code modulation]] system used for the digital [[PSTN]]. Per the [[Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem]], the sampling frequency (8kHz) must be at least twice the voice frequency (4kHz) for effective reconstruction of the voice signal.

== Fundamental frequency ==
The [[Human voice|voiced speech]] of a typical adult male will have a [[fundamental frequency]] from 85 to 180&amp;amp;nbsp;Hz, and that of a typical adult female from 165 to 255&amp;amp;nbsp;Hz.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Titze, I.R. (1994). Principles of Voice Production, Prentice Hall (currently published by NCVS.org) (pp. 188), ISBN 978-0-13-717893-3.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Baken, R. J. (1987). Clinical Measurement of Speech and Voice. London: Taylor and Francis Ltd. (pp. 177), ISBN 1-5659-3869-0.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Thus, the fundamental frequency of most speech falls below the bottom of the &amp;quot;voice frequency&amp;quot; band as defined above. However, enough of the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] will be present for the [[missing fundamental]] to create the impression of hearing the fundamental tone.
