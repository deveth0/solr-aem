        text="&lt;p&gt;[[File:LvMS-Lvv.jpg|thumb|A sand grain of volcanic glass under the [[petrographic microscope]].  Its amorphous nature makes it go extinct in cross-polarized light (bottom frame).  Scale box in millimeters.]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Volcanic glass&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the [[amorphous]] (uncrystallized) product of rapidly cooling [[magma]].  Like all types of [[glass]], it is a state of matter intermediate between the close-packed, highly ordered array of a crystal and the highly disordered array of gas.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Bates and Jackson, 1984, Dictionary of Geological Terms, 3rd ed., Prepared by the American Geological Institute&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Volcanic glass can refer to the interstitial, or [[matrix (geology)|matrix]] material in an [[aphanitic]] (fine grained) volcanic rock or can refer to any of several types of vitreous [[igneous rock]]s.  Most commonly, it refers to [[obsidian]], a [[rhyolitic]] glass with high [[silica]] content.

Other types of volcanic glass include:
* [[Pumice]], which is considered a glass because it has no crystal structure.
* [[Apache tears]], a kind of nodular obsidian.
* [[Tachylite]] (also spelled tachylyte), a [[basalt]]ic glass with relatively low silica content.
* [[Sideromelane]], a less common form tachylyte.
* [[Palagonite]], a basaltic glass with relatively low silica content.
* [[Hyaloclastite]], a hydrated tuff-like breccia of sideromelane and palagonite.
* [[Pele&amp;apos;s hair]], threads or fibers of volcanic glass, usually basaltic.
* [[Pele&amp;apos;s tears]], tear-like drops of volcanic glass, usually basaltic.
* [[Limu o Pele]] (Pele&amp;apos;s seaweed), thin sheets and flakes of brownish-green to near-clear volcanic glass, usually basaltic.
