&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Voice Crack&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] electronic [[free improvisation]] group. Formed in late 1972 by Andy Guhl and Norbert MÃ¶slang, Voice Crack were initially a [[free jazz]] duo. They began incorporating pre-recorded tape effects and live sound processing, and by 1983 they eliminated any normal instrumentation in favor of what they call &amp;quot;cracked everyday electronics:&amp;quot; Mundane objects such as &amp;quot;[[radio]]s, [[phonograph|turntable]]s, transmitters, [[dictaphone|dictating machines]]&amp;quot; and other items are cracked open and manipulated to produce &amp;quot;new sounds using magnetic and radio waves in a complex system controlled by movements of their hands and by light.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.for4ears.com/poire_z/about_poire_z.html For4ears.com]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The resulting music - which consisted of various overlapping buzzes, clicks, [[Drone (music)|drones]] and oscillations - has been described as, &amp;quot;Cascading magnetic waves arc across the sky as three-headed critters race and rummage through alien flora ... or at least that&amp;apos;s what it sounds like.&amp;quot;;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.erstwhilerecords.com/catalog/reviews/011_review.asp Erstwhilerecords.com]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and was favorably compared to some of [[John Cage]]&amp;apos;s work.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;amp;sql=A4ckmu3rkan8k Allmusic.com] {{Dead link|date=January 2011|bot=CactusBot}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Voice Crack collaborated with [[Borbetomagus]], [[Butch Morris]] (as part of a larger ensemble), and were members of [[poire z]]. The group has now disbanded.
