In [[Tolkien]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Silmarillion]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Voronwë&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (pronounced {{IPA-art|vɔˈrɔnwɛ|}}) was a [[Noldor]]in [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] from [[Gondolin]]. His name is [[Quenya]] in origin, meaning &amp;apos;steadfast one&amp;apos; (the [[Sindarin]] form is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bronwë&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). The name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Voronwë&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also appears as an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[epessë]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (honorary title) of various other characters, for example [[Mardil Voronwë]].
[[Image:Ulmo saves Voronwe.jpg|right|thumb|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ulmo and Voronwë&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;illustration by Tom Loback]]
Voronwë was relatively young according to the measure of the Elves, having been born in [[Middle-earth]] (and specifically in [[Nevrast]]) instead of [[Valinor]]. His father was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aranwë&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a Noldo, but his mother was of the [[Sindar]]in Elves of the [[Falas]], and kinswoman of [[Círdan]]. Voronwë called himself &amp;quot;of the House of [[Fingolfin]]&amp;quot;, which in this case likely means a follower of that house, rather than a relationship of blood, although some [[Tolkien fandom|Tolkien fans]] have proposed his descent from [[Daughters of Finwë|Irimë]], sister of Fingolfin.

Voronwë was among those Gondolindrim who were sent by [[Turgon]] to the [[Bay of Balar]] after the [[Nírnaeth Arnoediad|Battle of Unnumbered Tears]]. Their errand was to seek the help of Círdan in shipbuilding so that they would be able to reach Valinor and deliver the Elves&amp;apos; prayer for aid to the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Lords of the West]]. But he tarried on the way, wandering enchanted in the [[Nan-tathren|Willow-meads of Nan-tathren]]. Thus Voronwë came last of the messengers to Círdan, when six out of seven ships built at Turgon&amp;apos;s asking had sailed into the West.

He was the captain of the last, and the greatest, ship that for seven years journeyed across [[Belegaer]], seeking a path into the West through &amp;quot;loathing, and loneliness, and madness; terror of wind and tumult, and silence, and shadows where all hope is lost and all living shapes pass away&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{ME-ref|UT|Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin, p. 36}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Still, the [[Doom of the Valar]] worked against them, and the West was still shut. In despair they turned back, but when already within the sight of [[Middle-earth|Mortal Lands]], their ship was caught in a great storm and drowned.

However, Voronwë was spared, alone of all sent by Turgon and Círdan. He was saved by [[Ulmo]] and cast ashore at [[Vinyamar]], the land of his birth. There he was greeted by [[Tuor]] of the [[House of Hador|Third House of Men]], who passed him Ulmo&amp;apos;s bidding to guide Tuor to Gondolin. Reluctantly, Voronwë obeyed, remembering the prophecies of old. For more than a month they journeyed eastward along the southern slopes of [[Ered Wethrin]] to the entrance into the Hidden City, in spite of the Doom of the Valar and the Malice of the [[Morgoth|Enemy]], protected by Ulmo&amp;apos;s power. On the road they met Tuor&amp;apos;s first cousin [[Túrin Turambar]] by the ruins of [[Eithel Ivrin]] without recognizing him. Voronwë was admitted to Gondolin as a former inhabitant; Tuor was at first held captive, but then released and was able to pass to Turgon Ulmo&amp;apos;s warnings.

There is no further mention of Voronwë in the canon works, except a statement where it is implied that he survived the [[Fall of Gondolin]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Unfinished Tales: Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin, p. 33 and note 12.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Other accounts suggest that later he sailed into the West with Tuor and [[Idril]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{ME-ref|WotJ|The Tale of Years, p. 352, 354}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
