&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vobarno&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a town and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[comune]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the  [[Province of Brescia]] in the [[Italy|Italian]] region of [[Lombardy]], at 246&amp;amp;nbsp;m (807&amp;amp;nbsp;ft) above sea-level, with 7,500 inhabitants as of the 2003 census. It is 8&amp;amp;nbsp;km (5&amp;amp;nbsp;mi) by road NNW of [[Salò]] and [[Lake Garda]].

==History==
Although [[Neolithic]] remains have been found in the territory of the comune, nothing certain is known about the history of the area in prehistoric times nor in Antiquity, except for a single inscription, found near the town mentioning it as being at the confines of Italy.

Vobarno (known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vobarna&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) in the [[Middle Ages]] was a fief of the bishops of Brescia, who at least twice sent representatives to enforce their suzerainty.

The 14th century and the beginning of the 15th saw Vobarno involved in the wars of the [[Scaliger]], [[house of Visconti|Visconti]] and [[House of Malatesta|Malatesta]] families, until, apparently moved by self-interest rather than force, they submitted of their own to [[Venice]] in 1426. Milan contested the new realities but was beaten in 1454, and thereafter Vobarna was a Venetian fief until 1797 when French troops under [[Napoleon]] conquered northern Italy and put an end to the independence of the doges. Vobarno, faithful to Venice, was put to flames and the sword. After the Napoleonic interlude, the town passed with Venice to the dominion of Austria, finally becoming part of united Italy by 1866.
