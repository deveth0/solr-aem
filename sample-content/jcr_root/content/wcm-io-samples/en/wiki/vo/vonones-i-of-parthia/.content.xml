&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vonones I of Parthia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-fa|ونون یکم}}), (ΟΝΩΝΗΣ on his coins) ruled the [[Parthia|Parthian Empire]] from about 8 to 12 [[AD]]. He was the eldest son of [[Phraates IV of Parthia]] (ruled c. 37&amp;amp;ndash;2 BC) and was sent to [[Rome]] as a hostage in the 20s BC as surety for a [[treaty]] his father made with [[Augustus]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#1|2.1]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

After the assassination of [[Orodes III of Parthia|Orodes III]] in about the year 6 [[AD]], the Parthians applied to Augustus for a new King from the [[Arsacid Empire|house of Arsaces]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ref1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#2|2.2]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Augustus sent them Vonones I, but he could not maintain himself as King; he had been educated as a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and was despised by the Parthian nobility as a slave of the Romans.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ref1&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Another member of the Arsacid house, [[Artabanus III (of Parthia)|Artabanus III]] (ruled c.&amp;amp;nbsp;10&amp;amp;ndash;38), who was living among the [[Dahan (people)|Dahan]] nomads in the east of Parthia, was invited to the throne. In a civil war he defeated and expelled Vonones I.

The coins of Vonones I date from 8 to 12 AD and bear the inscription &amp;quot;King Vonones, conqueror of Artabanus&amp;quot; commemorating a temporary victory over his rival. Those of Artabanus II begin in the year 10. In about the year 12 Vonones I fled into [[Roman Armenia|Armenia]] and became King there.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#3|2.3]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; But Artabanus II demanded his deposition, and as Augustus did not wish to begin a war with the Parthians he removed Vonones I into [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], where he was kept in custody, though in a kingly style.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#4|2.4]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Later he was moved to [[Cilicia]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#58|2.58]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and when he tried to escape in about 19 AD, he was killed by his guards.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#68|2.68]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
