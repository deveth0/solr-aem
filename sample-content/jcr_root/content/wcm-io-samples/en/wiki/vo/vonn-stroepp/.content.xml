        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vonn Ströpp&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Vonn Stropp&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1962, [[Stanwell]], [[England]]) is the most-used of over 123 [[pseudonym]]s used by a [[Outsider Art|visionary]] [[Painting|painter]] whose work has been described as &amp;quot;a kind of [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|pre-Raphaelite]] [[Psychedelic art|psychedelia]]&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Preview events: Unquiet Voices, Iain Aitch, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Guardian&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, London, October 11, 2003&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The son of a [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] Irish father, he often speaks of a dismal childhood. Self-taught artistically, he began at age eleven to have what he described as visionary experiences. After dropping out of school, and working several low-level jobs, he began to paint obsessively. Von Ströpp, who now lives in [[Hounslow]], claims that, for him, the experience of painting is very painful, which he compares to [[crucifixion]]. An [[oil painting|oil painter]], with a [[surrealism|surrealist]] style somewhat comparable to that of [[Salvador Dalí]], his works are mainly scenes and [[Landscape art|landscape]]s, often with [[apocalyptic]] overtones.

His work has been widely exhibited at venues including the [[Collection de l&amp;apos;art brut]], [[Lausanne]], the [[American Visionary Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]], and the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] Museum. [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Michael Stipe]] are collectors.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.artofimagination.org/Pages/VonStropp.html Von Stropp], Society for Art of Imagination&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
