[[File:Voiddeck.JPG|thumb|right|A void deck under a HDB apartment block in Singapore.]]

A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;void deck&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is typically found under [[Apartment|apartment blocks]] in [[Singapore]]. The void deck occupies the ground level, while apartments are usually on the second floor onwards. Void decks are a space for community mingling and functions are often attended by neighbours across the ethnic spectrum.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;AFP (2010). &amp;quot;Singapore&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;void decks&amp;apos; reflect racial rainbow&amp;quot;. http://www.france24.com/en/20100423-singapores-void-decks-reflect-racial-rainbow&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Sometimes, events like [[Malay people|Malay]] [[wedding]]s, [[China|Chinese]] weddings or [[Wake (ceremony)|funeral wakes]] are held in such places.

Small [[grocer]]s, medical and [[dentistry|dental]] [[clinic]]s, [[bakery|bakeries]] and other shops are often located in void decks, especially in older apartment blocks. These amenities are often converted bomb shelters, while parts of the shelter would be kept usable in case of an attack occurring (many flats have a dual purpose room that doubles as an attack shelter). Most void decks also have [[Bicycle stand|bicycle rack]]s, benches, and recreational tables for residentsâ€™ use. It is common for void deck tables to have either a [[xiangqi]] or [[checkers]] board carved on them.

Void decks also facilitate the travelling through the apartment buildings on the ground level, rather than travelling around them.
