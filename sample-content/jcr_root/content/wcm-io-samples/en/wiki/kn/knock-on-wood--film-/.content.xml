&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Knock on Wood&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 1954 comedy starring [[Danny Kaye]] and [[Mai Zetterling]].  Other actors in the film include [[Torin Thatcher]], [[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]], and [[Leon Askin]].  The film was written and directed by [[Melvin Frank]] and [[Norman Panama]], with songs by Kaye&amp;apos;s wife, [[Sylvia Fine]].

==Plot==
Jerry Morgan (Kaye) is a [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist]] who is having trouble with love:  just when his relationship with a woman gets around to marriage, his dummy turns jealous and spoils everything. Jerry&amp;apos;s manager Marty threatens to quit unless Jerry sees a psychiatrist, Ilse Nordstrom (Zetterling), who tries to discover the source of his problem. The two of them eventually fall in love.

At the same time, Jerry becomes unwittingly intertwined with spies and has to run from the police. In his escape, he finds himself impersonating a British car salesman, trying to demonstrate a new convertible with loads of bells and whistles. Later on, he finds himself on stage in the middle of the performance of an exotic ballet.

==Production notes==
The film features dialogue with linguistic play (particularly the names of the dummies &amp;quot;Clarence&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Terrence&amp;quot; and the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] names of the spies) which would also be a feature of Kaye&amp;apos;s later film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Court Jester]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (likewise written and directed by Frank and Panama).

The title song &amp;quot;Knock on Wood&amp;quot; should not be confused with &amp;quot;Everybody Thinks I&amp;apos;m Crazy&amp;quot; from the 1941 cartoon entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Woody Woodpecker&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, starring [[Woody Woodpecker|the character of the same name]]; or the song &amp;quot;Knock on Wood&amp;quot; from the 1942 film, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (with music by M.K. Jerome and lyrics by Jack Scholl). Kaye performed renditions of both the title song from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Knock on Wood&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;quot;The Woody Woodpecker Song,&amp;quot; which are found on the album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Best of Danny Kaye&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [Spectrum, 2000].
