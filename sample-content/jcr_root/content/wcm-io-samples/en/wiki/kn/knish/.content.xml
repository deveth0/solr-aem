A knish consists of a [[filling (cooking)|filling]] covered with [[dough]] that is either [[baking|baked]], [[grilling|grilled]], or [[deep frying|deep fried]]. Knishes can be purchased from [[street vendor]]s in urban areas with a large Jewish population, sometimes at a [[hot dog stand]] or from a butcher shop.

In the most East European traditional versions, the filling is made entirely of [[mashed potato]], ground meat, [[sauerkraut]], [[onion]]s, [[kasha]] ([[buckwheat]] groats), or [[cheese]]. Other varieties of fillings include [[sweet potatoes]], [[black beans]], [[fruit]], [[broccoli]], [[tofu]], or [[spinach]].

Many cultures have variations of baked, grilled, or fried dough-covered snacks to which epicurean family the knish belongs including the [[Pasty|Cornish pasty]], the Scottish [[Bridie]], the [[Jamaican patty]], the Spanish and Latin American [[empanada]], the Middle Eastern [[fatayer]], the Portuguese &amp;apos;&amp;apos;rissol&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[rissole]]), the Italian [[calzone]], the Indian [[samosa]], the Polish [[pierogi]], the Russian [[Pirozhki]], and the Ukrainian Pyrizhky.

Knishes may be round, rectangular, or square. They may be entirely covered in dough or some of the filling may peek out of the top. Sizes range from those that can be eaten in a single bite [[hors d&amp;apos;oeuvre]] to [[sandwich]]-sized.
