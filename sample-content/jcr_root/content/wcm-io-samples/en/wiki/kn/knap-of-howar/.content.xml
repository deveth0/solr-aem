At &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Knap of Howar&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on the island of [[Papa Westray]] in [[Orkney]], Scotland, a [[Neolithic]] farmstead may be the oldest preserved stone house in northern Europe.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/propertyresults/propertyoverview.htm?PropID=PL_190 &amp;quot;Knap of Howar&amp;quot;] [[Historic Scotland]]. Retrieved 23 Sept 2011.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Radiocarbon dating shows that it was occupied from [[37th century BC|3700]] BC to 2800 BC, earlier than the similar houses in the settlement at [[Skara Brae]] on the [[Mainland, Orkney|Orkney Mainland]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 40.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==The site==
The farmstead consists of two adjacent rounded rectangular thick-walled buildings with very low doorways facing the [[sea]]. The larger and older structure is linked by a low passageway to the other building, which has been interpreted as a workshop or a second house. They were constructed on an earlier [[midden]], and were surrounded by midden material which has protected them. There are no windows; the structures were presumably lit by fire, with a hole in the roof to let out smoke. Though they now stand close to the shore, they would have originally lain inland. The shore shows how the local [[Rock (geology)|stone]] splits into thin slabs, giving a ready source of construction material.

The walls still stand to an [[eaves]] height of 1.6m, and the stone furniture is intact giving a vivid impression of life in the house. Fireplaces, partition screens, beds and storage shelves are almost intact, and post holes were found indicating the roof structure.

Evidence from the middens shows that the inhabitants were keeping [[cattle]], [[sheep]] and [[pig]]s, cultivating [[barley]] and [[wheat]] and gathering [[shellfish]] as well as [[fishing]] for species which have to be line caught using boats.

Finds of finely-made and decorated [[Unstan ware]] pottery link the inhabitants to [[chambered cairn]] tombs nearby and to sites far afield including [[Balbridie]] and [[Eilean Domhnuill]].
The name Howar is believed to be derived from [[Old Norse]] word  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;haugr&amp;apos;&amp;apos;  meaning  mounds or [[Tumulus|barrows]].  The site is in the care of [[Historic Scotland]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.paparproject.org.uk/orkney3.html  Broch of Burrian Archaeology (The Papar Project)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
