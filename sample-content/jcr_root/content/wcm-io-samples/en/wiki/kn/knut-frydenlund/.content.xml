&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Knut Frydenlund&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (March 31, 1927&amp;amp;ndash;February 26, 1987) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] diplomat. His most significant achievement was as [[Foreign minister of Norway|Norwegian foreign minister]] between 1973 and 1981, and again between 1986 and 1987.

Frydenlund was born in [[Drammen]] and began his diplomatic career in the 1950s, initially serving at the Norwegian embassy in [[Bonn]], and served in various diplomatic positions during the &amp;apos;50s and the 1960s. In 1969 he was elected to parliament as a member of the [[Norwegian Labour Party]], and he became foreign minister in the Labour government in 1973. While Labour was out of power from 1981 to 1986, he was replaced as foreign minister by [[Svenn Thorkild Stray]], but returned to the office in May 1986. In February 1987, following his return from a [[Nordic Council]] meeting in [[Helsinki]], he collapsed at [[Oslo]]&amp;apos;s [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu|Fornebu Airport]] due to a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] and died soon afterwards at Ullevaal Hospital in Oslo.
