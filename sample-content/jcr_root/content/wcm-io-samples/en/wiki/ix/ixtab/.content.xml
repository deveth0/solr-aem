&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ixtab&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-myn|iʃˈtaɓ}}) or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rope Woman&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the Yucatec Mayan goddess of [[suicide]] according to [[Diego de Landa]]. In Yucatec society, under certain circumstances, suicide, especially suicide by hanging, was considered an honorable way to die. Ixtab would accompany such suicides to paradise (thus playing the role of a [[psychopomp]]). Here, joined by people who died as soldiers or as sacrificial victims, by women who died in childbirth and by members of the priesthood, they enjoyed a delectable existence rewarded with delicious food and drink and resting under the shade of a pleasant tree, [[Yaxche]], free from all want.

The picture of a dead woman with a rope around the neck in the [[Dresden Codex]] is often taken to represent the goddess. Since it occurs in a section devoted to eclipses of sun and moon, it may have been used to symbolize a lunar eclipse and its dire consequences for women, especially pregnant ones: Lunar eclipses exposed their unborn children to the risks of deformation and death. No other pictures possibly representing Ixtab are known.
