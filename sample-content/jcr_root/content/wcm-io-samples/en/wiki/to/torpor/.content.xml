&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Torpor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (hibernation) is a state of decreased physiological activity in an animal, usually by a reduced [[body temperature]] and rate of [[metabolism]]. Torpor is used to enable animals to survive periods of reduced food availability. A torpor bout can refer to the period of time a [[hibernation|hibernator]] spends at low body temperature, and last days to weeks, or it can refer to a period of low body temperature and metabolism lasting less than 24 hours, as in &amp;apos;daily torpor&amp;apos;.

Animals that undergo daily torpor include birds (even tiny [[hummingbirds]], notably [[Cypselomorphae]]),&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Hainsworth(1970)a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;

During the active part of their day, animals that undergo daily torpor maintain normal body temperature and activity levels, but their metabolic rate and body temperature drops during a portion of the day (usually night) to conserve energy. Torpor is often used to help animals survive during periods of colder temperatures, as it allows the organism to save the amount of energy that would normally be used to maintain a high body temperature.

Some animals seasonally go into long periods of reduced body temperature, metabolic rate and inactivity made up of multiple torpor bouts known as [[hibernation]] if it occurs during winter, or [[estivation|aestivation]] if it occurs during the summer. Daily torpor, on the other hand, is not seasonally dependent and can be an important part of energy conservation at any time of year.

Torpor is a well-controlled [[Thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] process and not, as previously thought, the result of switching off thermoregulation.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Geiser(2004)a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;

Marsupial torpor differs from non-marsupial mammalian ([[Eutheria]]l) torpor in the characteristics of arousal. Eutherial arousal relies on a heat producing tissue, [[brown adipose tissue]], as a mechanism to accelerate rewarming. Marsupial arousal appears not to rely on brown adipose tissue derived [[thermogenesis]], and the mechanism of their arousal is not yet known.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Dawson, T.J., et al. (eds.); &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fauna of Australia Vol. 1b - Mammalia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; [http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/publications/fauna-of-australia/pubs/volume1b/17-ind.pdf 17. Morphology and Physiology of the Metatheria]; pp. 102, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;p. 30&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Other uses of the word==
Torpor is alternatively used as a reference to any non-physiological state of inactivity.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

As an example, recently naturalists have learned that female crocodiles enter a deep torpor without aggression during their short egg laying period.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;
