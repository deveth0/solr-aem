A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;tourist attraction&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a place of interest where [[Tourism|tourists]] visit, typically for its inherent or exhibited cultural value, historical significance, natural or built beauty, or amusement opportunities.
Some examples include historical places, [[monument]]s, [[zoo]]s, [[public aquarium|aquaria]], [[museum]]s and [[art galleries]], [[botanical garden]]s, buildings and structures (e.g., [[castle]]s, [[libraries]], former [[prison]]s, [[skyscraper]]s, [[bridge]]s), national [[park]]s and [[forest]]s, [[theme park]]s and [[carnival]]s, [[open air museum|living history museums]], [[ethnic enclave]] communities, [[heritage railway|historic trains]] and cultural events. Many tourist attractions are also [[landmark]]s.

Tourist attractions are also created to capitalise on legends such as a supposed [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] crash site near [[Roswell, New Mexico]] and the alleged [[Loch Ness monster]] sightings in [[Scotland]]. Ghost sightings also make tourist attractions.

Ethnic communities may become tourist attractions, such as [[Chinatown]]s in the United States and the black British neighborhood of [[Brixton]] in [[London]], England.

In the US, owners and marketers of attractions advertise tourist attractions on billboards along the side of highways and roadways, especially in remote areas. Tourist attractions often provide free promotional brochures and flyers in information centres, fast food restaurants, [[hotel]] and [[motel]] rooms or lobbies, and [[rest area]].

While some tourist attractions provide visitors a memorable experience for a reasonable admission charge or even for free, others can have a tendency to be of low quality and to overprice their goods and services (such as admission, food, and souvenirs) in order to profit from tourists excessively. Such places are commonly known as [[tourist trap]]s.

==Novelty attraction==
Novelty attractions are oddities such as the &amp;quot;[[biggest ball of twine]]&amp;quot; in [[Cawker City, Kansas]], the [[Corn Palace]] in [[Mitchell, South Dakota]], or [[Carhenge]] in [[Alliance, Nebraska]] where old cars serve in the place of stones in a replica of [[Stonehenge]]. Novelty attractions are not limited to the American Midwest, but are part of [[Midwestern United States#Culture|Midwestern culture]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/us/16bridge.html &amp;quot;A Golden Gate Fantasy on the Kansas Prairie&amp;quot;] article by A.G. Suleberger in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The New York Times]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; September 15, 2010, accessed September 16, 2010&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Tourist destination==
A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;tourist destination&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a city, town, or other area that is dependent to a significant extent on the revenues accruing from tourism. It may contain one or more tourist attractions and possibly some &amp;quot;tourist traps.&amp;quot;
