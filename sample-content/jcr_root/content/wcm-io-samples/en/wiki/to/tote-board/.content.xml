{{Wiktionary}}
A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;tote board&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a large numeric or alphanumeric display used to convey information, typically at a [[race track]] (to display the odds or payoffs for each horse) or at a [[telethon]] (to display the total amount donated to the charitable organization sponsoring the event).

The term &amp;quot;tote board&amp;quot; comes from the colloquialism for &amp;quot;totalizator&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;totalisator&amp;quot;), the name for the automated system which runs [[parimutuel betting]], calculating payoff odds, displaying them, and producing tickets based on incoming bets.

The first totalisator was invented by [[William Brownie Garden]].{{cn|date=June 2012}} The machine was installed at [[Ellerslie Racecourse]] in New Zealand in 1925, and the second was installed at [[Gloucester Park Racetrack]] in [[Western Australia]] in 1930. [[George Julius]] founded Automatic Totalisators Limited (ATL) in 1917, which supplied the &amp;quot;Premier Totalisator: now including electrical components&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;AE&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Chisholm, Alec H. (ed.), The Australian Encyclopaedia, Vol. 4, p. 538, “Horse Racing”, Halstead Press, Sydney, 1963&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The first totalisators installed in the [[United States]] were at [[Hialeah Park]], [[Florida]], in 1932 (by ATL), and at [[Arlington Park]] racecourse, [[Chicago]], in 1933. The first entirely electronic totalisator was developed in 1966.

Totalisators have been superseded by general purpose [[computer]]s running specialised [[gambling|wagering]] [[software]] such as [[Autotote]]. In many cases beyond older systems, telethon tote boards have either been replaced by [[LCD]] displays showing totals, or [[scoreboard]]s adapted to display dollar amounts.

An automatic totalisator is a device to add up the bets in a [[pari-mutuel]] betting system.  The whole of the pot (the stakes on all competitors) is divided &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[pro rata]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to the stakes placed on the winning competitor and those tickets are paid out. Essentially it implements a system of [[starting price]] (SP) betting.

In particular it refers to the invention of George Julius, the English-born, New Zealand educated, Australian inventor, engineer and businessman, a leader of Australian engineering in the first half of the twentieth century.

The term automatic refers to the fact that the bets were automatically summed and a ticket issued when a bet was registered on the issuing machines, and it provided a safe and virtually fraud-free method of betting, replacing the earlier [[jam-pot totes]], which used either paper transactions or some method of counting bets like steel ball bearings. The machine did not actually calculate the payout.

The method was widely used in the Australian, New Zealand and American [[horse-racing]] industries and for [[greyhound racing]] in the UK, although there were other installations in countries as diverse as France, Venezuela and Singapore.
