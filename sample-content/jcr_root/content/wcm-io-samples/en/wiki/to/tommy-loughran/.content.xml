&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Thomas Patrick Loughran&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (November 29, 1902&amp;amp;nbsp;â€“ July 7, 1982) was an [[United States|American]] professional boxer and the former [[light heavyweight]] [[boxing]] champion of the world.

Loughran&amp;apos;s effective use of coordinated foot work, sound defense and swift, accurate counter punching is now regarded as a precursor to the techniques practiced in modern boxing.  Loughran fought many middleweight, light heavyweight, and heavyweight champions in his career, including [[Gene Tunney]], [[Jack Sharkey]] and [[Georges Carpentier]]. Loughran even achieved a Newspaper Decision over fistic phenom [[Harry Greb]]. Loughran was but 19 years old when he first met Greb.

As a light heavyweight, he defeated two future world heavyweight champions: [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] and [[James J. Braddock]]. Loughran finally fought [[Primo Carnera]] for the heavyweight title but lost a decision.

While Loughran is remembered among boxing&amp;apos;s elite, his career was marred by his fragile hands and jaw.

He is a member of the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]].  He was the [[Ring Magazine fighters of the year|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ring Magazine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s Fighter of the Year]] in 1929 and 1931.

He appeared as himself on the [[game show]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[To Tell the Truth]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on February 12, 1957.
