&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tongs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are used for [[wikt:gripping|gripping]] and lifting [[tool]]s, of which there are many forms adapted to their specific use.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Dictionary (software)|Dictionary]].  Vers. 2.1.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Some are merely large [[pincer (tool)|pincer]]s or [[nipper (tool)|nipper]]s, but the greatest number fall into three classes:

# Tongs which have long [[arm]]s terminating in small flat circular [[Friction#Coefficient of friction|ends of tongs]] and are pivoted close to the [[handle (grip)|handle]], as in the common fire-tongs, used for picking up pieces of [[coal]] and placing them on a [[fire]].
# Tongs consisting of a single band of [[metal]] bent round one or two bands joined at the head by a [[spring (device)|spring]], as in [[sugar]]-tongs (a pair of usually silver tongs with claw-shaped or spoon-shaped ends for serving lump sugar), [[asparagus]]-tongs and the like.
# Tongs in which the [[lever|pivot]] or [[joint]] is placed close to the gripping ends, such as a [[Drilling and threading|driller]]&amp;apos;s round tongs, [[blacksmith]]&amp;apos;s tongs or [[crucible]]-tongs.

The tongs are the most-used [[cooking utensil]] when [[grilling]] or [[barbecuing]], as they provide a way to move, rotate and turn the food with delicate precision.

According to [[Pirkei Avot]], a classical Jewish text of the third century of the common era, the first pair of tongs were created by God right before God rested in the Seventh Day.  The reasoning is that a blacksmith must use a pair of tongs in order to fashion a brand new pair of tongs.  Accordingly, God must have provided humankind with the first pair of tongs.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Scherman, Nosson.  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ethics of the Fathers&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Annotations.  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Complete ArtScroll Siddur&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  Brooklyn, NY: Mesorah Publications, 1984.  544-586.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
