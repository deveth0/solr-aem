A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;towboat&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[boat]] designed for pushing [[barge]]s or [[car float]]s.  Towboats are characterized by a square bow with steel knees for pushing and powerful engines.  They are most often seen on inland [[waterway]]s and western rivers where they can push more than 50 large barges lashed together into a tow of varying shapes and sizes.  Towboats that travel long distances (linehaul) include living quarters for the crew. Outside of the USA towboats are usually referred to as &amp;quot;push boats&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;pushers&amp;quot;.

==Towboat size==

Towboats range in size from less than {{convert|600|hp|0}} up to {{convert|11100|hp|0}}. Most towboats are from {{convert|35|to|200|ft}} long, and {{convert|21|to|56|ft|1}} wide. Smaller boats are used in [[harbors]], fleeting areas and around [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] while larger boats operate in &amp;quot;line-haul&amp;quot; operations over long distances and between major ports. In the United States, south of the [[Chain of Rocks Lock]] across from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] on the [[Mississippi River]], the river is open with no locks or impediments other than channel size and depth. Larger boats can run this segment of the river with the maximum tow size of 42 barges southbound and 40+ northbound. A typical River tow might be 35 to 42 barges, each about {{convert|200|ft}} long by {{convert|35|ft}} wide, configured in a rectangular shape 6 to 7 barges long and 5 to 6 barges wide, depending on the number of barges in tow. The whole tow, excluding the towboat, can easily be over {{convert|1200|ft}} long and {{convert|200|ft}} wide, covering over {{convert|6|acre|1}} and holding thousands of tons of cargo.

In the United States above St. Louis on the Upper Mississippi River and on other rivers such as the [[Illinois River|Illinois]], [[Ohio River|Ohio]], [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]], [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]], boats can handle only up to 15 barges due the size of lock chambers.  These boats tend to be limited to {{convert|5000|hp|0}}.

Towboats in line-haul service operate 24/7 and have the latest in navigational equipment, such as color radar, GPS systems, electronic river charts, and specialized radio communications.

Boats that traverse the Intra-Coastal Waterway (ICW) are commonly referred to as &amp;quot;ditch boats&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;canal boats&amp;quot;. ICW tows usually consist of 1 to 4 barges ranging in size, usually &amp;quot;strung out&amp;quot; end to end when loaded or &amp;quot;doubled up&amp;quot; side by side when empty.

Towboats always push the fleet of barges, which are lashed together with steel cables usually {{convert|1|to|1.5|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} in diameter.  The term towboat arises from [[steamboat]] days, when steamboat fortunes began to decline and to survive steamboats began to &amp;quot;tow&amp;quot; wooden barges alongside to earn additional revenue.  Eventually, the railroad expansion following the [[American Civil War]] ended the steamboat era.
