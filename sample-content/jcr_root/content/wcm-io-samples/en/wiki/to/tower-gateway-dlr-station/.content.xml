&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tower Gateway&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Docklands Light Railway]] station near the [[Tower of London]]. It is in [[Travelcard Zone 1]]. It adjoins the tracks to [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street]] and is on the site of [[Minories railway station]].

It is a short walk from Tower Hill and Fenchurch Street stations. Access at street level from the [[Minories]] is via escalator, stairs or lift at the western end of the station. A pedestrian crossing connects the station with [[Tower Hill tube station]], its closest London Underground connection. A narrow secondary staircase entrance at the eastern end of the platform, improved considerably in the early 2000s, descends to [[Mansell Street]]. It serves the eastern edge of the [[City of London]] financial district and development around [[St Katharine Docks]].

It was opened in 1987 as the western terminus of the initial DLR system and the station closest to central London.

The underground extension to [[Bank station (London)|Bank]], which opened in 1991, diverges from the original route between Tower Gateway and [[Shadwell DLR station|Shadwell]], the next station to the east. It dives down a steep ramp not far from the eastern end of the platforms, from which it is clearly visible. Tower Gateway is the terminus for the less busy service to [[Beckton DLR station|Beckton]]. Journeys to other branches of the DLR normally require a change.

In keeping with the DLR&amp;apos;s original basic lightweight philosophy, Tower Gateway is a simple elevated terminus.  As built it had two tracks and a cross-over. When the extension to Bank opened, its importance was substantially reduced. Before reconstruction it had a fairly narrow central platform, and a single track leading from the main route to a set of points immediately prior to the platforms.

Further major alterations began on 30 June 2008. The station reopened on 2 March 2009, rebuilt as a single-track terminus to enable three-car trains with a platform on each side of the train, one for arriving passengers and the other for departures (the [[Spanish solution]]).
