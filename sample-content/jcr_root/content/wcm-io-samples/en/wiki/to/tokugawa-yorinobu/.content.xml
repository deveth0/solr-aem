{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tokugawa Yorinobu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|徳川 頼宣||April 28, 1602 – February 19, 1671}} was a Japanese daimyo of the early Edo period.

[[File:Tokugawa Yorinobu.jpg|thumb|Tokugawa Yorinobu.]]

Born under the name Nagafukumaru, he was the 10th son of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], by his concubine Oman-no-kata. On December 8, 1603, Yorinobu received the fief of Mito, then rated at 200,000 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;koku&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as his fief. Mito had formerly belonged to his older brother, [[Takeda Nobuyoshi]]. Following his stipend increase to 250,000 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;koku&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in October 1604, he came of age on September 12, 1606, taking the name Yorimasa, and receiving the court rank of junior 4th, lower grade (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ju-shi-i-ge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and the title of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hitachi no Suke&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. On January 6, 1610, he was transferred to a 500,000 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;koku&amp;apos;&amp;apos; fief in [[Suruga Province|Suruga]] and [[Tōtōmi Province]]s (thereby founding [[Sunpu Domain]] centered around [[Sunpu Castle]]), and took the name Yorinobu. However, after a little under a decade in Suruga, he was transferred to the 550,000 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;koku&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Wakayama Domain]] on August 27, 1619, following the transfer of the previous rulers, the [[Asano clan]], to Hiroshima, in [[Aki Province]]. Yorinobu thus became the founder of the [[Kii Province|Kii]] branch of the Tokugawa family. Yorinobu&amp;apos;s wife was the daughter of [[Katō Kiyomasa]]. By the end of his life, Yorinobu had achieved junior 2nd court rank (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ju-ni-i&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), as well as holding the title of [[dainagon]] (&amp;quot;major counselor&amp;quot;).

Yorinobu had four children: his successor [[Tokugawa Mitsusada]], [[Yorizumi]], the founder of the [[Iyo-Saijo Domain]], Inaba-hime, who married [[Ikeda Mitsunaka]] of the [[Tottori Domain]], and Matsuhime, who married [[Matsudaira Nobuhira]] of the [[Yoshii Domain]].

He was the father of [[Tokugawa Mitsusada|Mitsusada]] and [[Matsudaira Yorizumi|Yorizumi]]. Following his death, he was referred to by the title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nanryū-in&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

In 1915, Yorinobu was posthumously promoted to senior 2nd court rank (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;shō-ni-i&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).
