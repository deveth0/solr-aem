:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;This article is about 1970&amp;apos;s era band named Touch.  For the article about the 1960&amp;apos;s era band also named Touch see [[Touch (60s band)]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Touch&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Rock and roll|rock]] band from [[New York City]] formed in 1978. [[Mark Mangold]] (songwriter and keyboards), Glen Kithcart (drums), and Craig Brooks (guitars) had all previously been in the band [[American Tears]] (releasing three albums on [[Columbia Records]]). The lineup was completed by bassist [[Doug Howard (musician)|Doug Howard]].

Their single, &amp;quot;Don&amp;apos;t You Know What Love Is&amp;quot; only reached #69 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].  However, the song was played heavily on [[Album-oriented rock|AOR]] radio stations in the USA at the end of the 1970s, and reached the #1 spot on the [[Melody Maker]] chart in [[Great Britain]].

Touch was the first band to play at the inaugural [[Monsters of Rock]] festival at [[Castle Donington]] racetrack in 1980. A live version of &amp;quot;Don&amp;apos;t You Know What Love Is&amp;quot; appeared on the compilation LP &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Monsters of Rock&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, documenting performances at the festival.

The eponymous debut album by Touch, originally issued on [[Atco Records]] in 1980, has been noted{{By whom|date=April 2011}} as a touchstone for artists working in the recently developed, but retro leaning, [[Melodic Rock]] genre.

[[Todd Rundgren]] produced a 2nd unreleased LP for Touch. The recordings surfaced as bonus tracks on the CD reissue of the first album. The band was harshly divided as to wanting to have the whole of the 2nd album re-recorded.  This internal division resulted in a &amp;apos;stand off&amp;apos; between the band members individually, their label and management. And thus the band split up.

Mark Mangold has continued to write and record with and for other artists.  The song &amp;quot;[[I Found Someone]]&amp;quot;, a collaboration with [[Michael Bolton]], was recorded by [[Laura Branigan]] and ultimately became a top 10 hit for [[Cher]].

[[Doug Howard (musician)|Doug Howard]] has also continued to perform, record and write with acts and artists such as Todd Rundgren, [[Edgar Winter]], Stun Leer, and [[Roy Buchanan]] as well as a member of Rundgren&amp;apos;s [[Utopia (band)|Utopia]] (Howard is co-writer of the Utopia hit &amp;quot;[[Feet Don&amp;apos;t Fail Me Now]]&amp;quot; and managing partner of [http://www.lodestar-entertainment.com Lodestar Entertainment].






The band is not to be confused with the American proto-prog band Touch, formed in 1966 (releasing the album Touch on Deram in 1969).
