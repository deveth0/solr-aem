[[Image:toad-of-toad-hall.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for a 2008 theatrical production of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Toad of Toad Hall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Toad of Toad Hall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the first of several dramatisations of [[Kenneth Grahame]]&amp;apos;s 1908 novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Wind in the Willows]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  It was written by [[A. A. Milne]], with [[incidental music]] by [[Harold Fraser-Simson]].

Milne extracted the adventures of [[Mr. Toad]] (which form only about half of the original book) because they lent themselves most easily to being staged.  Milne loved Grahame&amp;apos;s book, which is one of the reasons he decided to adapt it.  The play has four main characters: Rat, Badger, Mole, and Toad.  Toad&amp;apos;s caravan and car adventures are included, as well as his imprisonment, escape, and subsequent fight with the weasels and stoats to regain his home with the help of his friends.  Although not a musical, the play contains six songs.

Its first production was at the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]] in [[London]] on 17 December 1929.

In season 2, episode 2 of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Downton Abbey]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, the dowager countess says to Lady Edith Crawley, &amp;quot;You&amp;apos;re not Toad of Toad Hall!,&amp;quot; after Lady Edith announces at dinner that she has volunteered to operate a tractor at a nearby farm because the men who normally operate it are away fighting in World War One.
