        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;death by natural causes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as recorded by [[coroner]]s and on [[death certificate]]s and associated documents, is one that is primarily attributed to an illness or an internal malfunction of the body not directly influenced by external forces. For example, a person dying from complications from [[influenza]] (an infection) or a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] (an internal body malfunction) would be listed as having died of natural causes. [[Old age]] is not a scientifically recognized [[cause of death]]; there is always a more direct cause although it may be unknown in certain cases and could be one of a number of [[aging-associated diseases]].

In contrast, death caused by active intervention is called [[unnatural death]].  The &amp;quot;unnatural&amp;quot; causes are usually given as [[accident]] (implying no unreasonable voluntary risk), [[death by misadventure|misadventure]] (accident following a willful and dangerous risk), [[suicide]], or [[homicide]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite book|author=Bryant, Clifton D. |title=Handbook of death &amp;amp; dying |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks |year=2003 |pages=968 |isbn=0-7619-2514-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  In some settings, other categories may be added.  For example, a [[prison]] may track the deaths of [[incarceration|inmates]] caused by acute intoxication separately.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite book|author=Stark, Martha |title=A physician&amp;apos;s guide to clinical forensic medicine |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=2000 |pages=225 |isbn=0-89603-742-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Additionally, a cause of death may be recorded as &amp;quot;undetermined&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2009/12/what_exactly_are_natural_causes.html |publisher=Slate.com |title=What, Exactly, Are &amp;quot;Natural Causes&amp;quot;? |author=Palmer, Brian |date= 21 December 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
