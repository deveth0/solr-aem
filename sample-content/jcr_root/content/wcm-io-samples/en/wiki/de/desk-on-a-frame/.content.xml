        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;desk on a frame&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or desk on frame) is usually an antique form made up of two pieces of furniture. The first piece is a fairly large and closable [[portable desk]] with  a slanted hinged top giving access to the writing surface and utility nooks and small drawers. The second piece is a stand made for it in the same style and material. It is also sometimes a single piece of furniture which looks as if it were made up of the two previous pieces but is in fact solid and undetachable. This form was popular in [[Colonial America]] and was often done in the [[Queen Anne style furniture|Queen Anne style]].

The [[slant top desk]] is a direct morphological descendant. In a sense the  Spanish [[Bargueno desk|Bargueno]] (or Vargueno) desk is a distant cousin of the two piece version, since the Bargueno is also made up of a portable desk and a stand constructed specially for it, using the same materials and style.
