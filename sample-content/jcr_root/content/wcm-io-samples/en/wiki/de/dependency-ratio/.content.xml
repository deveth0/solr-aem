        text="&lt;p&gt;In [[economics]] and [[geography]] the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;dependency ratio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an age-population ratio of those typically not in the [[labor force]] (the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;dependent&amp;apos;&amp;apos; part) and those typically in the labor force (the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;productive&amp;apos;&amp;apos; part). It is used to measure the pressure on productive population.

==Formula==
In published international statistics, the dependent part usually  includes those under the age of 15 and over the age of 64.The productive part makes up the population in between, ages 15 – 64. It is normally expressed as a percentage:
:&amp;lt;math&amp;gt;(Total)\ Dependency\ ratio = \frac{(number\ of\ people\ aged\ 0-14\ and\ those\ aged\ 65\ and\ over)} {number\ of\ people\ aged\ 15-64} \times 100 &amp;lt;/math&amp;gt;

As the ratio increases there may be an increased burden on the productive part of the population to maintain the [[child|upbringing]] and [[pension]]s of the economically dependent. This results in direct impacts on financial expenditures on things like [[social security]], as well as many indirect consequences.

The (total) dependency ratio can be decomposed into the child dependency ratio and the aged dependency ratio:&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.apheo.ca/index.php?pid=63 Association of Public Health Epidemiologists in Ontario]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

:&amp;lt;math&amp;gt;Child\ dependency\ ratio = \frac{number\ of\ people\ aged\ 0-14} {number\ of\ people\ aged\ 15-64}  \times 100 &amp;lt;/math&amp;gt;

:&amp;lt;math&amp;gt;Aged\ dependency\ ratio\ = \frac{number\ of\ people\ aged\ 65\ and\ over} {number\ of\ people\ aged\ 15-64} \times 100  &amp;lt;/math&amp;gt;

== World Bank 2010 Age dependency ratio by country ==
As of 2010 Japan and Europe had high aged dependency ratios compared to other parts of the world.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.DPND.OL/countries?display=map&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Inverse ==
The inverse of the dependency ratio, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;inverse dependency ratio&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; can be interpreted as how many independent workers have to provide for one dependent person (pension &amp;amp; expenditure on children)

== Problems ==
A high dependency ratio can cause serious problems for a country. As the largest proportion of a government&amp;apos;s expenditure is on health, social security &amp;amp; education which are most used by old and young population. Also the increasing expenditure on pension becomes a problem too.

Nevertheless, the dependency ratio ignores the fact that the 65+ are not necessarily dependent (an increasing proportion of them is working) and that many of those of &amp;apos;working age&amp;apos; are actually not working. Alternatives have been developed&amp;apos;, such as the &amp;apos;economic dependency ratio&amp;apos;, but they still ignore factors such as increases in productivity and in working hours. Worries about increasing (demographic) dependency ratio should thus be taken with caution.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/pubdocs/2012/59/en/2/EF1259EN.pdf&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Migrant Labor Dependency Ratio==
Migrant Labor Dependency Ratio (MLDR) is used to describe the extent to which the domestic population is dependent upon migrant labor.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://rspas.anu.edu.au/~athu/Journal%20Papers/International%20labou%2006.pdf&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Migration2008&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|author=International Organization for Migration|title=World Migration 2008: Managing Labour Mobility in the Evolving Global Economy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UllpLB1hwdIC&amp;amp;pg=PA440|accessdate=21 August 2012|year=2008|publisher=Hammersmith Press|isbn=978-92-9068-405-3|pages=440–}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
