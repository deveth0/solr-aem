&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dessi España&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born Despina Kekhayova ({{lang-bg|Деспина Кехайова}}); 1972 – May 22, 2004) was an [[United States|American]] and [[Bulgaria]]n [[circus|circus performer]] with the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp;amp; Bailey Circus]].

==Biography==
España came from a family of Bulgarian performers. As part of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kehaiovi [[teeterboard]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; act, the troupe earned two places in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]], a decoration from the [[Bulgaria]]n Ministry of Culture and the [[Silver Clown Award]]. At 13, España broke a world record by swirling 75 [[hula hoop|silver hoops]] simultaneously around her body. She broke her own record twice, with 88 then 97 hoops. The latter feat was broadcast on the &amp;quot;Live With Regis and Kathie Lee&amp;quot; show.
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dessi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; married Mexican [[trapeze]] artist [[Ivan España]] during a Ringling Bros. show in 1992. She occasionally performed in his motorcycle act—standing in the center of a steel sphere as he and other cyclists rode around her. Their children, Zore and Sian, were also training to become circus entertainers.

==Fatal accident==
She died after a fall while performing aerial [[acrobatics]] using [[Aerial silk|chiffon scarves]] without a safety net 25 minutes into a three-hour show at the [[Xcel Energy Center]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]].  España was twirling upside-down, hanging by her legs from long chiffon scarves tied to a metal bar when either the silky cloth or a mechanism holding the cloth in place failed and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dessi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; hit the floor head first.
Chiffon acts traditionally do not use safety nets. España later died at the hospital from her injuries. It was the first fatal accident during a Ringling Bros. circus in a decade.
An old and little-used [[law]] on the books in [[Minnesota]] makes it illegal to allow performers to do high-flying acrobatic acts without a net underneath.  Violations are considered gross [[misdemeanor]]s, punishable with a 250[[United States dollar|USD]] fine and up to one year in [[Prison|jail]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}.  It is unclear if the law will be enforced in this case.
