The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dells of the Wisconsin River&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; — also called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wisconsin Dells&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (from French &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[dalles]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or narrows) — is&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;The Dells of the Wisconsin River&amp;quot; is generally used in the singular.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; a 5-mile (8-km) [[gorge]] on the [[Wisconsin River]] in south-central [[Wisconsin]], USA. It is noted for its scenic beauty, in particular for its unique [[sandstone]] rock formations and [[tributary]] [[canyon]]s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://dnr.wi.gov/org/land/er/sna/index.asp?sna=283 Wisconsin State Natural Areas Program - Dells Of The Wisconsin River]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The cliffs, some over 100 feet (30&amp;amp;nbsp;m) high, and side canyons are closed to the public to protect sensitive ecological features.  The viewing of the rock formations by water is a popular tourist attraction in the area. The nearby city of [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin|Wisconsin Dells]] is the center of summer tourist activity, much of it in the form of the [[theme park]]s unrelated to the river features.

==Description and formation==
[[image:WisconsinDells02.jpg|thumb|250px|Rock formation on the Wisconsin Dells]]

The Dells was formed during the last [[ice age]] approximately 15,000 years ago, although the rock itself is much older, dating from the [[Cambrian]] approximately 510-520 million years ago when the area of Wisconsin was at the bottom of a shallow sea.

Approximately 19,000 years ago, the Dells was at the extreme eastern margin of the continental [[glacier]].  However, the Dells itself was never covered by glacial ice sheets - it was part of the large [[Driftless Area]] that was bypassed by the ice.  The melting of the glacier formed [[Glacial Lake Wisconsin]], a lake about the size of [[Great Salt Lake]] in [[Utah]] and as deep as 150 feet (45&amp;amp;nbsp;m).  The lake was held back by an ice dam of the remaining glacier.  The eventual bursting of the ice dam unleashed a catastrophic [[flood]], dropping the lake&amp;apos;s depth to 50 feet (15&amp;amp;nbsp;m) and cutting deep, narrow gorges and unusual rock formations into the sandstone seen today.

==Unique ecosystem==
The area of the Dells provides a mixture of plant communities, including northern and southern [[oak]] and [[pine]] forests, as well as [[oak savanna]], moist cliffs, and dry cliffs.

The cliffs provide unique niches for plants, some of which are very rare in Wisconsin, including:
*Cliff cudweed (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gnaphalium obtusifolium var saxicola&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ), which is known in only two places on Earth - in the Dells and in the Kickapoo Valley, grows on protected rock ledges.
*Lapland azalea (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Rhododendron lapponicum&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)
*Round-stemmed false foxglove (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Agalinis gattingeri&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)
*[[Maidenhair spleenwort]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Asplenium trichomanes&amp;apos;&amp;apos;)
*Fragrant fern (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dryopteris fragrans&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

Among the rare animals in the dell are six [[dragonfly]] species, including the [[Macromia taeniolata|Royal river cruiser]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Macromia taeniolata&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), six rare [[mussel]]s and numerous species of birds.

==Cultural history==
The cultural history of the area stretches back several thousand years, from early [[Paleo-Indian]] people to the more recent [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] peoples, such as [[Ho-Chunk]], [[Sac (people)|Sac]], and [[Menominee]], who left behind effigy and burial mounds, camps and village sites, garden beds, and rock art.

The Dells were made famous in 1886 by the [[photographer]] [[H. H. Bennett]], who took the first stop-action photo of his son jumping onto Stand Rock.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.dells.com/dellshistory History and Origin of Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin!&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Protected status==
The area is now owned by the [[Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources]] and was designated a State Natural Area in 1994.
