&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dead Famous&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the title of a series of books following the lives of famous people who are now dead, such as [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. The special books in this collection are based on certain groups of people, such as [[Inventors]] and [[Lists of writers|Authors]]. These books are a spin-off of the [[Horrible Histories]] collection and are published by the same company, [[Scholastic Press|Scholastic]]; however, many different authors and illustrators work on these books. The books are aimed at 7-14 year olds, and have sold many copies around the world, especially in the UK.
The books often contain diaries, journals and newspapers which show what life would have been like at that time. These are almost always created by the author him/herself, but are shown as having been created by the person whom the book is about.
