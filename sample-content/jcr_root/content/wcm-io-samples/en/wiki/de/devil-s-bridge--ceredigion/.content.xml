&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Devil&amp;apos;s Bridge&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-cy|Pontarfynach}}, lit. &amp;quot;The bridge on the Mynach&amp;quot;) is a [[village]] in [[Ceredigion]], [[Wales]].

== Description ==
The [[bridge]]   spans the [[Afon Mynach|Mynach]], a [[tributary]] of the [[River Rheidol|Rheidol]]. The bridge is unusual in that three separate bridges are coexistent, each one built upon the previous bridge. The most recently built is an iron bridge (1901), which was built over a [[stone bridge]] (1753), which was built when the original bridge was thought to be unstable. The builders of the 1753 bridge used the original bridge (built 1075â€“1200) to support [[scaffolding]] during construction.

The bridge is at a point where the [[Afon Mynach|River Mynach]] drops {{convert|90|m|ft|-2}} in 5 steps&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |title=Mid Wales 2008 |url=http://www.cavinguk.co.uk/holidays/MidWales2008/ |work=CavingUK |accessdate=9 September 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; down a steep and narrow [[ravine]] before it meets the River Rheidol. The set of stone steps leading down to the lowest bridge at the waterfall are known as Jacob&amp;apos;s Ladder.

According to the legend the original bridge was built by the [[Devil]], as it was too difficult for mortals to build. The agreement stipulated that the Devil would build the bridge in return for the [[soul]] of the first life to cross the bridge. The Devil built the bridge but was tricked by an old woman who threw bread onto the bridge. Her dog crossed the bridge for the bread, thus becoming the first life to cross the new bridge.

== Tourism ==
Devil&amp;apos;s Bridge has been a tourist attraction for centuries. The celebrated English author [[George Borrow]] wrote &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Wild Wales&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1854), which includes a lively, humorous account of his visit to Pontarfynach. The George Borrow Hotel, a 17th century inn where Borrow reputedly stayed during his visit, is located nearby.

Devil&amp;apos;s Bridge is served by [[Devil&amp;apos;s Bridge railway station]] on the historic narrow-gauge [[Vale of Rheidol Railway]], which opened between [[Aberystwyth]] and Devil&amp;apos;s Bridge in 1902.

The area was once part of the [[Hafod Uchtryd|Hafod Estate]] owned by [[Thomas Johnes]].  Johnes built a small hunting lodge on the estate which, after several expansions and upgrades, is now operated as the Ceilliau Hotel.

In recent days it has been owned by Gurtrud H. Roberts.
