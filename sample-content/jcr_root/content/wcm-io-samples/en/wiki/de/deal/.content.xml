In [[cryptography]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;DEAL&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Data Encryption Algorithm with Larger blocks&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a [[block cipher]] derived from the [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES). The design was proposed in a report by [[Lars Knudsen]] in 1998, and was submitted to the [[AES contest]] by [[Richard Outerbridge]] (who notes that Knudsen had presented the design at the [[Selected Areas in Cryptography|SAC]] conference in 1997).

DEAL is a [[Feistel network]] which uses [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] as the round function. It has a 128-bit [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] and a variable [[key size]] of either 128, 192, or 256 bits. For key sizes of 128 and 192 bits, the cipher uses 6 rounds, increasing to 8 for the 256-bits size. The scheme has a comparable performance to [[Triple DES]], and was relatively slow compared to many other AES candidates.
