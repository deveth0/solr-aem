&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dean Benjamin McLaughlin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born October 25, 1901, [[Brooklyn]], Queens, New York CIty; died December 8, 1965, [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], Michigan, US) was an American [[astronomer]]. He was a professor of astronomy at the University of Michigan. He was the father of the science fiction author [[Dean McLaughlin|Dean B. McLaughlin, Jr.]]

In 1954 he proposed the theory that there are [[volcano]]es on [[Mars]] and that their eruptions change the [[albedo feature]]s called &amp;quot;mare&amp;quot; (The martian equivalent of [[Lunar mare]]). His proposal was partially confirmed in 1971 with the arrival of [[Mariner 9]], which showed that strong winds could move dust around the planet, creating the changes of appearance formerly attributed to some kind of vegetation [http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.2700].

A [[Impact crater|crater]] on Mars [[McLaughlin (Martian crater)|was named]] in his honor, as is the crater [[McLaughlin (lunar crater)|McLaughlin]] on the far side of the Moon and the asteroid [[2024 McLaughlin]].
