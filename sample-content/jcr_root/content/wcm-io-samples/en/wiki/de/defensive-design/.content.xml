&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Defensive design&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the practice of planning for [[contingency|contingencies]] in the [[design]] stage of a project or undertaking. Essentially, it is the practice of anticipating all possible ways that an end-user could misuse a device, and designing the device so as to make such misuse impossible, or to minimise the negative consequences. For example, if it is important that a plug be inserted into a socket in a particular orientation, the socket and plug should be designed so that it is physically impossible to insert the plug incorrectly. Power sockets are often keyed in such a manner, to prevent the transposition of live and neutral.

Defensive design in [[software engineering]] is called [[defensive programming]]. [[Murphy&amp;apos;s law]] is a well-known statement of the need for defensive design.
==Examples==
* Many [[electrical connectors]] apply this principle by being asymetric.
