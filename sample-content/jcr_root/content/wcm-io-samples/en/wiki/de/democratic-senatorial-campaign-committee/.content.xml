==2011-12 election cycle==
In 2012, 23 Democratic Senate seats were available, as opposed to 10 Republican seats. An increase of four seats would have given the GOP a Senate majority. In the election, two GOP seats were lost, increasing the Democratic majority by two.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.com/news/article/supermajority-within-reach-for-senate-democrats Supermajority Within Reach for Senate Democrats]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

DSCC executive director said their strategy was to “localize” elections – make them “a choice between the two people on the ballot...and not simply allow it to be a nationalized election.”&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;RCP 2012 Race&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2011/11/03/dems_aim_to_localize_2012_senate_races.html Democrats Aim to Localize 2012 Senate Races]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Because this is not easy to do in a presidential election year, the DSCC has gone very much on the offensive, depicting Republican candidates and donors, and especially the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]], as extreme. During the Florida and Indiana primaries, they are pushing that the Tea Party is working to move the GOP &amp;quot;so far to the right that candidates will say anything to get their party&amp;apos;s nomination.&amp;quot; The GOP is targeting four red states to pick up the seats they need for a Senate majority. They were looking at states that didn&amp;apos;t swing for President Obama in 2008: Missouri, Montana, Nebraska and North Dakota.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;RCP 2012 Race&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Year for Women&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2011/12/06/dscc_chair_2012_could_be_historic_year_for_women.html DSCC Chair: 2012 Could Be Historic Year for Women]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
