==Official lyrics==

:Dear land of Guyana, of rivers and plains
:Made rich by the sunshine, and lush by the rains,
:Set gem-like and fair, between mountains and seas,
:Your children salute you, dear land of the free.

:Green land of Guyana, our heroes of yore,
:Both bondsmen and free, laid their bones on your shore.
:This soil so they hallowed, and from them are we,
:All sons of one Mother, Guyana the free.

:Great land of Guyana, diverse though our strains,
:We&amp;apos;re born of their sacrifice, heirs of their pains,
:And ours is the glory their eyes did not see,
:One land of six peoples, united and free.

:Dear land of Guyana, to you will we give,
:Our homage, our service, each day that we live;
:God guard you, great Mother, and make us to be
:More worthy our heritage, land of the free.
