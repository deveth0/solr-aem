In [[genetics]], a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;deletion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;gene deletion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;deficiency&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;deletion mutation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) (sign: [[delta (letter)|Δ]]) is a [[mutation]] (a [[Chromosome#Chromosomal aberrations|genetic aberration]]) in which a part of a [[chromosome]] or a sequence of [[DNA]] is missing. Deletion is the loss of genetic material. Any number of [[nucleotide]]s can be deleted, from a single base to an entire piece of chromosome.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Lewis&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Lewis R.  2005.  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Human Genetics: Concepts and Applications&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 6th Ed.  McGraw Hill, New York.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Deletions can be caused  by errors in [[chromosomal crossover]] during [[meiosis]].  This causes several serious [[genetic disease]]s.
Deletion also causes [[frameshift]].

==Causes==
Causes include the following:
* Losses from [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]]
* [[Chromosomal crossover]]s within a [[chromosomal inversion]]
* [[Unequal crossing over]]
* Breaking without rejoining

For [[synapsis]] to occur between a chromosome with a large intercalary deficiency and a normal complete homolog, the unpaired region of the normal homolog must loop out of the linear structure into a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;deletion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;compensation loop&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Types==
Types of deletion include the following:
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Terminal Deletion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - a deletion that occurs towards the end of a chromosome.
*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Intercalary Deletion / Interstitial Deletion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - a deletion that occurs from the interior of a chromosome.

*&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;microdeletion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; - a relatively small amount of deletion (up to 5kb that could include a dozen genes).
Microdeletion is usually found in children with physical abnormalities. A large amount of deletion would result in immediate abortion (miscarriage).

==Effects==

It could affect eye sight, skin tone or loss of weight.

Small deletions are less likely to be fatal; large deletions are usually fatal - there are always variations based on which genes are lost.  Some medium-sized deletions lead to recognizable human disorders, e.g. [[Williams syndrome]].

Deletion of a number of pairs that is not evenly divisible by three will lead to a [[frameshift mutation]], causing all of the [[codon]]s occurring after the deletion to be read incorrectly during [[translation (genetics)|translation]], producing a severely altered and potentially nonfunctional [[protein]]. In contrast, a deletion that is evenly divisible by three is called an &amp;apos;&amp;apos;in-frame&amp;apos;&amp;apos; deletion.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.gen2phen.org/wiki/lsdb-controlled-vocabulary-terms LSDB - Controlled vocabulary terms] at The GEN2PHEN Knowledge Centre. Posted Fri, 08/01/2010.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Deletions are responsible for an array of genetic disorders, including some cases of male [[infertility]] and two thirds of cases of [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Lewis&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  Deletion of part of the short arm of chromosome 5 results in [[Cri du chat]] syndrome.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Lewis&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  Deletions in the [[survival motor neuron|SMN]]-encoding gene cause [[spinal muscular atrophy]], the most common genetic cause of infant death.

Recent work suggests that some deletions of highly conserved sequences (CONDELs) may be responsible for the evolutionary differences present among closely related species. Such deletions in humans are referred to as [[hCONDELs]] may be responsible for the anatomical and behavioral differences between humans,chimpanzees and other mammals.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;McLeanCory&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite doi|10.1038/nature09774}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Detection==

The introduction of molecular techniques in conjunction with classical cytogenetic methods has in recent years greatly improved the diagnostic potential for chromosomal abnormalities. In particular, microarray-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) based on the use of BAC clones promises a sensitive strategy for the detection of DNA copy-number changes on a genome-wide scale. The resolution of detection could as high as &amp;gt;30,000 &amp;quot;bands&amp;quot; and the size of chromosomal deletion detected could as small as 5–20 kb in length.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal|last=Ren|first=H|title=BAC-based PCR fragment microarray: high-resolution detection of chromosomal deletion and duplication breakpoints|journal=Human Mutations|year=2005|month=May|volume=25|issue=5|pages=476–482|pmid=15832308|doi=10.1002/humu.20164}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
