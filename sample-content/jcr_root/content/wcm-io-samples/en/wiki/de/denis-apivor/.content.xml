&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Trevor Denis ApIvor&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 14, 1916{{spaced ndash}}May 27, 2004) was a British composer, part of the generation of modernists that included [[Humphrey Searle]] and [[Elisabeth Lutyens]].

Born in [[County Westmeath]], Ireland, to Welsh parents, he went to [[Hereford Cathedral School]] then  studied medicine in London, but had also pursued the study of music from an early age. He studied [[musical composition|composition]] with [[Alan Rawsthorne]] and [[Patrick Hadley]]. His most successful early works included a setting of [[T. S. Eliot]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Hollow Men&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1939), several ballets, including &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Mirror for Witches&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, with choreography by [[AndrÃ©e Howard]] (1952) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Blood Wedding&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1953), and an opera &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Yerma&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1954).

Around 1960, he began composing in a [[serialism|serialist]] style.  He was influenced in this by [[Edward Clark (conductor)|Edward Clark]], a conductor, former BBC music producer, student of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and husband of Elisabeth Lutyens.  This continued until the late 1980s, when he returned to [[diatonic]] composition.

ApIvor is particularly well known to guitarists, as he made a major contribution to the repertoire of their instrument. Solo works include &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Variations&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1959), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Discanti&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1970), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Saeta&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1972), and ten serial pieces included with his book &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Serial Composition for Guitarists&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1982). He also wrote a Concertino for guitar (1954), &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Liaison&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for guitar and keyboard (1976), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cinquefoil&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for flute, guitar, and viola (1984).
