&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Descanso Gardens&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, located in [[La Cañada Flintridge, California|La Cañada Flintridge]], [[Los Angeles County]], [[California]], is a {{convert|150|acre|ha}} [[botanical garden]].

At one time, this property belonged to newspaper magnate [[E. Manchester Boddy]], who owned the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Los Angeles Daily News]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He ran a commercial camellia garden at the location, supplying [[prom]] boutonnières, for example, until he ceded the site to [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] in 1953.

The county has developed the property to include a [[rosarium]], as well as a [[Japanese tea house]], [[lilac]] garden, bird sanctuary, [[xeriscape]], and a gift shop. They also regularly host professional camellia shows, chamber music, and weddings. They are busiest however on the [[Easter]] weekend, when the [[tulip]]s are in bloom and eggs are hidden on the central lawn of {{convert|1|acre|m2}}.

The park also features the Descanso Gardens Enchanted Railroad, an eighth scale replica of a diesel train, that takes visitors around a section of the park.

==Boddy House==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boddy House&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the original 22-room house built by E. Manchester Boddy, which was designed by [[James Dolena]] in the Hollywood Regency style in 1937.

In 2007, Boddy House was rehabilitated for the 43rd annual [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] Showcase House of Design, and decorated in a contemporary re-interpretation of its original Hollywood Regency style.  Subsequently, a major grant from the Ahmanson Foundation enabled the addition of a museum-quality Heritage Exhibit, with exhibits about the gardens, Manchester Boddy&amp;apos;s life and times, and important donors and volunteers for the Descanso Gardens.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.descansogardens.org/site/boddyhouse.cfm Descanso Gardens: Boddy House]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The house is open for docent-led tours on Saturdays and Sundays at noon.  The house is available for rental.

==Other==
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Carriage House Art Gallery&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; hosts changing exhibits by local artists.

In 2005, [[David R. Brown (graphic designer)|David R. Brown]], former president of the nearby [[Art Center College of Design]], was appointed executive director of Descanso Gardens.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Descanso Gardens appoints new Executive Director&amp;quot;, Pasadena Living Magazine, July 2005.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The gardens were featured as a game map in the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] [[Game show|reality game show]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Cha$e]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The 1991 remake of the television series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Land of the Lost (1991 TV series)|Land of the Lost]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was filmed on location in the Gardens.
