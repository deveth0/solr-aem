&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Telegraaf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;The Telegraph&amp;quot;) is the largest [[Netherlands|Dutch]] daily morning [[newspaper]], with a daily circulation of approximately {{formatnum:529000}}. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Telegraaf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is based in [[Amsterdam]]. [[:nl:Sjuul Paradijs|Sjuul Paradijs]] is the editor-in-chief of the paper.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Telegraaf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is owned by the [[Telegraaf Media Groep]], which also publishes a daily free newspaper, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Spits (newspaper)|Sp!ts]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Spits&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in Dutch means both &amp;quot;rush hour&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;peak&amp;quot;).

==Editorial content==
This national newspaper contains many &amp;quot;sensational&amp;quot; and sports-related articles, and one or more pages the content of which is supplied by the [[gossip]]-magazine &amp;apos;&amp;apos;PrivÃ©&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Private&amp;quot;). The financial news coverage (http://www.dft.nl), however, is more serious in tone. The paper targets a broad audience, mostly in a conservative and populist style,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|last=Hermes|first=Joke|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2005|pages=39|isbn=978-1-4051-2245-0|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JoEGuRxG42cC&amp;amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=5 February 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; attracting specific target groups for the paper&amp;apos;s advertisers.

The newspaper not only reports news, but also actively campaigns in political issues.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2694/Tech-Media/article/detail/3314972/2012/09/12/De-Telegraaf-helpt-rechts-een-handje.dhtml&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==History==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Telegraaf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was founded by [[Henry Tindal]], who simultaneously started another paper &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Courant&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;The Gazette&amp;quot;). The first issue appeared on 1 January 1893. Following Tindal&amp;apos;s death on 31 January 1902 the printer [[HMC Holdert]], with backing from financiers, took over &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Telegraaf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Courant&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on 12 September 1902. This proved to be a good investment, particularly with regard to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Courant&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, enabling Holdert between 1903 and 1923 to take over one newspaper after another, suspending publication as he went. He added the name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Amsterdamsche Courant&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;Amsterdam Gazette&amp;quot;) as a subtitle to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Telegraaf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Het Nieuws van den Dag&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;The News of the Day&amp;quot;) to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Courant&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 1926, he began construction of a new printing facility at the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in Amsterdam, designed by [[J.F. Staal]] and [[G.J. Langhout]]. Construction was completed and the building occupied in 1930. At one point, in June 1966, the building was besieged by angry construction workers and [[Provo (movement)|Provo]] followers, after a false report that a victim of a labour dispute had been killed not by the police but by a co-worker. In 1974, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Telegraaf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; moved to its current location in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Basisweg&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

During [[World War I]], when the Netherlands was officially [[Neutral country|neutral]], Holdert&amp;apos;s [[France|French]] sympathies and his pro-[[United Kingdom|British]] standpoint caused &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Telegraaf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to be the focus of some controversy. During [[World War II]], the Telegraaf companies published pro-[[Germany|German]] papers, which led to a thirty year ban on publishing after the war. The prohibition was, however, lifted in 1949 and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Telegraaf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; flourished anew to become the biggest newspaper in the Netherlands.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Courant/Nieuws van de Dag&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ceased publication in 1998.

From 21 March 2004 until 27 December 2009, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De Telegraaf&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was published on Sundays. From 1 January 2010 they ceased the publication on Sundays.
