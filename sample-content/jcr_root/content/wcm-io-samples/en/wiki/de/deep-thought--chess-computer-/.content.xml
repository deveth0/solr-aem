        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Deep Thought&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[computer]] designed to play chess. Deep Thought was initially developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and later at [[IBM]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citeweb|title=History of deep blue|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/meet/html/d.3.1.html|accessdate=2008-02-18}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  It was second in the line of [[chess]] computers developed by [[Feng-hsiung Hsu]], starting with [[ChipTest]] and culminating in [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]]. In addition to Hsu, the Deep Thought team included [[Thomas Anantharaman]], Mike Browne, [[Murray Campbell]] and Andreas Nowatzyk.&amp;lt;ref name=AAAIBerliner&amp;gt;[http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewFile/753/671 Deep Thought wins the $10,000 Fredkin Prize], [[Hans Berliner]]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;   Deep Thought was easily defeated in both games of a two-game match with [[Garry Kasparov]] in 1989 as well as in a [[correspondence chess|correspondence]] match with [[Michael Valvo]].

It was named after &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[List of minor The Hitchhiker&amp;apos;s Guide to the Galaxy characters#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a fictional computer in [[Douglas Adams]]&amp;apos; series, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Hitchhiker&amp;apos;s Guide to the Galaxy]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The naming of chess computers has continued in this vein with [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]], [[Deep Fritz]], [[Deep Junior]], etc.

Deep Thought won the [[North American Computer Chess Championship]] in 1988 and the [[World Computer Chess Championship]] in the year 1989, and its [[ELO rating system|rating]], according to the [[United States Chess Federation|USCF]] was 2551.&amp;lt;ref name=AAAIBerliner /&amp;gt;  In 1994, Deep Thought 2 won the [[North American Computer Chess Championship]] for the fifth time, with its rating estimated at around 2600. It was sponsored by [[IBM]]. Some engineers who designed Deep Thought also worked in the design of Deep Thought 2. Its algorithms were quite simple evaluation functions, but it could examine half a billion chess positions per move in tournament games, which is sufficient to reach depth of 10 or 11 moves ahead in complex positions. Despite that, using the technique of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;singular extensions&amp;apos;&amp;apos; it could also follow lines of forced moves that reach even further, which is how it once found a [[checkmate]] in 37 moves.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
