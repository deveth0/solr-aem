==Early life==
He attended the (Roman Catholic) [[St Cuthbert&amp;apos;s High School|St Cuthbert&amp;apos;s Grammar School]] on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gretna Road&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. He then attended [[Northumberland College]] in [[Ashington]].

From 1969-94, he was an electrician at Ellington Colliery in [[Ellington, Northumberland|Ellington]], which closed in 2005.

==Parliamentary career==
On his proudest achievement in government since 1997 Denis Murphy said:  &amp;quot;I was proud of the major role I played to secure funding for the UK mining industry, safeguarding hundreds of jobs in my constituency and the future of the last deep mine in the Great Northern coalfield, [[Ellington, Northumberland|Ellington]] colliery in Northumberland.&amp;quot; Ellington Colliery subsequently closed on 26 January 2005.

* Voted for an amendment saying the case for renewing the UK&amp;apos;s [[UK Trident programme|Trident]] nuclear submarine system &amp;quot;is not yet proven&amp;quot; and that a decision should be delayed.
* Signed Early Day Motion 2699 Freedom of Information, 10 December 2006.
* Has campaigned hard for a local rail service in his constituency, with talks advancing further in early 2007.

On 5 November 2009, Murphy announced his decision to stand down at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|next general election]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://morpeth.journallive.co.uk/2009/11/wansbeck-mp-denis-murphy-to-st.html | title=Wansbeck MP Denis Murphy to stand down | publisher=&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; |date=5 November 2009}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; His successor in the constituency is [[Ian Lavery]], the President of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]].
