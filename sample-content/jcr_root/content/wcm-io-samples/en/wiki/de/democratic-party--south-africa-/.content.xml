The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Democratic Party &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (DP) was the name of the [[South Africa]]n political party now called the Democratic Alliance (DA). Although the Democratic Party name dates from 1989, the party existed under other labels throughout the [[Apartheid]] years, when it was the Parliamentary opposition to the ruling [[National Party of South Africa|National Party]]&amp;apos;s policies.

From 1989 to 1994 the party had three co-leaders, [[Zach de Beer]], [[Denis Worrall]] and [[Wynand Malan]], and won 34 seats in the [[South African general election, 1989|1989 election]], up from 20 before the vote. In 1994, [[Tony Leon]] became the party&amp;apos;s sole leader.

After the [[South African general election, 1999|1999 election]], the DP, under the leadership of Tony Leon, became Official Opposition to the [[African National Congress]]-led government.

As the party absorbed smaller anti-apartheid groupings, as well as defectors from the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] (the main opposition party in South Africa prior to 1977), its name changed a few times. Prior to the adoption of the Democratic Party label, it was known variously as the [[Progressive Party (South Africa)|Progressive Party]], [[Progressive Reform Party (South Africa)|Progressive Reform Party]], [[Progressive Federal Party (South Africa)|Progressive Federal Party]].

The DP had a short-lived merger with the [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]] (NNP) from 2000 to 2001 to form the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA). Even though the NNP left the alliance, the DA chose to retain its new name.
