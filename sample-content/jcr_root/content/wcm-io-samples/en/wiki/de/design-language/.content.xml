        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;design language&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;design vocabulary&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an overarching scheme or style that guides the design of a complement of products or architectural settings.&amp;lt;ref name=design&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=Do You Matter?: How Great Design Will Make People Love Your Company|last=Brunner |first=Robert|coauthors=Emery, Stewart; Hall, Russ|year=2009 |publisher= Pearson Education|isbn= 978-0-13-714244-6|pages=157â€“72}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Designers wishing to give their suite of products a unique but consistent [[look and feel]] define a design language for it, which can describe choices for design aspects such as materials, colour schemes, shapes, patterns, textures, or layouts.&amp;lt;ref name=design/&amp;gt;  They then follow the scheme in the design of each object in the suite.&amp;lt;ref name=design/&amp;gt;

Usually, design languages are not rigorously defined; the designer basically makes one thing in a similar manner as another.  In other cases, they are followed strictly, so that the products gain a strong thematic quality.  For example, although there is a great variety of unusual [[chess piece|chess set]] designs, the pieces within a set are usually thematically consistent.

Sometimes, designers encourage others to follow their design languages when decorating or accessorizing.  In the context of [[graphical user interface]]s, for example, [[human interface guidelines]] can be thought of as design languages for applications.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/bds/4p-guidelines.html Bringing Design to Software]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In automobiles, the design language is often in the [[grille]] design. For instance, many [[BMW]] vehicles share a design language,&amp;lt;ref name=design/&amp;gt; including front-end styling consisting of a split kidney and four circular headlights. Some manufacturers have appropriated design language cues from rival firms.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://cardesignnews.com/site/home/new_cars/display/store4/item131864/ Car Design News Car Design Gallery on Form Language]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Software==
In software architecture, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;design languages&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are related to [[Architecture Description Language]]s, or ADLs. The most well known design language is [[Unified Modeling Language]].
