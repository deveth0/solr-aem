The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Indian XXXIV Corps&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was formed in March 1945&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Marston, The Indian Army in the Burma Campaign&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; to be part of the [[British Fourteenth Army]] for [[Operation Zipper]], the invasion of [[British Malaya]]. Significant formations under Fourteenth Army for &amp;apos;Zipper,&amp;apos; possibly under XXXIV Corps, included [[5th Indian Division]], [[23rd Indian Division]], [[25th Indian Infantry Division]], and [[26th Indian Infantry Division]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citation | title = Operation Zipper: The Invasion of Malaya, August 1945| author = Graham Watson | date=May 6, 2001 | url = http://www.orbat.com/site/history/historical/malaysia/operationzipper.html}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Since Japan surrendered before the operation could be executed, the corps, under the command of Lieutenant-General [[Ouvry Lindfield Roberts|Ouvry Roberts]], did not see wartime service. It did, however, see occupation duty after the conflict was over.

XXXIV Corps was still active in September 1945 in Malaya, with HQ 2nd British Infantry Division, 25th Indian Division, [[50th Indian Tank Brigade]], and [[150th Indian Infantry Brigade]], which was en route to [[Hong Kong]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.orbat.com/site/history/historical/usa/alliedlandforcessoutheastasia1945.html. Which 150th Brigade is unclear; maybe Joslin can sort this out.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
