&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;XXIII Corps&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[corps]] of the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].  It served in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] as part of the [[Army of the Ohio]].

The corps was organized in April 1863 by order of the departmental commander, [[Ambrose E. Burnside]].  Along with Burnside&amp;apos;s old [[IX Corps (ACW)|IX Corps]], which had been sent west with him after [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], it was to maintain a primarily defensive position in Eastern Tennessee and [[Kentucky]].  It originally consisted of two divisions under the overall command of General [[George Lucas Hartsuff|George L. Hartsuff]].

The corps played a major role during the [[Knoxville Campaign]], its first major action, distinguishing itself at the battles of [[Battle of Campbell&amp;apos;s Station|Campbell&amp;apos;s Station]] and [[Battle of Fort Sanders|Knoxville]], and also took part in some minor actions in early 1864. During this time it was commanded by [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Mahlon D. Manson]].

The [[Army of the Ohio]] joined [[William T. Sherman]] for the [[Atlanta Campaign]] that spring.  IX Corps was detached and sent back to rejoin the [[Army of the Potomac]], so the &amp;quot;army&amp;quot; consisted entirely of XXIII Corps, now commanded by [[John M. Schofield]].  It served ably if unspectacularly throughout the campaign.

In the fall of 1864, it was sent north to counter [[John B. Hood]]&amp;apos;s [[Franklin-Nashville Campaign]], and it saw heavy action at the [[Battle of Franklin]], though it was held in reserve at [[Battle of Nashville|Nashville]].

After this campaign, the corps was sent east to serve in the Department of the South; it took part in the capture of [[Second Battle of Fort Fisher|Fort Fisher]] and the [[Battle of Wilmington|seizure of Wilmington, North Carolina]] (the last open port of the South).  During this time it was commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Jacob D. Cox]].  The corps ultimately joined Sherman&amp;apos;s army in the [[Carolinas Campaign]], and was disbanded in August 1865.
