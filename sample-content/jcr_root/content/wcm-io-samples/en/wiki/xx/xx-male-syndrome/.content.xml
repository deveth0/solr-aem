&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;XX male syndrome&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;de la Chapelle syndrome&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, for a researcher who characterized it in 1972&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite journal | author=de la Chapelle A | title=Analytic review: nature and origin of males with XX sex chromosomes | journal=Am J Hum Genet | year=1972 | pages=71–105 | volume=24 | issue=1  | pmid=4622299 | pmc=1762158}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;) is a rare sex chromosomal disorder. Usually it is caused by unequal [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing over]] between [[X chromosome|X]] and [[Y chromosome]]s during [[meiosis]] in the father, which results in the X chromosome containing the normally-male [[SRY]] gene.  When this X combines with a normal X from the mother during fertilization, the result is an XX male.

This syndrome occurs in approximately four or five in 100,000 individuals, making it less common than [[Klinefelter syndrome]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;pmid17579198&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal |author=Vorona E, Zitzmann M, Gromoll J, Schüring AN, Nieschlag E |title=Clinical, endocrinological, and epigenetic features of the 46,XX male syndrome, compared with 47,XXY Klinefelter patients |journal=J.

==Presentation==
Symptoms usually include small [[testes]] and subjects are invariably [[infertility|sterile]]. Individuals with this condition sometimes have feminine characteristics, with varying degrees of [[gynecomastia]] but with no intra-abdominal [[Müllerian duct|Müllerian tissue]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;pmid5501706&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; According to research at the [[University of Oklahoma]] health science centers, most XX males are not stereotypically feminine and are typical boys and men{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} although other reports suggest that facial hair growth is usually poor and libido is diminished, with notable exceptions.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;pmid5501706&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite journal |author=Lisker R, Flores F, Cobo A, Rojas FG |title= A case of XX male syndrome |journal=J.

==Clinical diagnosis==
* Standard XX [[karyotype]] in two tissues (with at least one, or both, containing the male [[SRY]] gene)
* Male external genitalia, sometimes showing [[hypospadias]]
* Two testes which may or may not have descended the [[inguinal canal]].  Most XX males have descended testes.
* Absence of Müllerian tissue

==Pathophysiology==
Males typically have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each [[diploid]] cell of their bodies.  Females typically have two X chromosomes.
XX males have two X chromosomes, with one of them containing genetic material from the Y chromosome, making them phenotypically male; they are genetically female but otherwise appear to be male.
