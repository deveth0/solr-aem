:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;For the Twenty-First Army Corps of the Union Army during the American Civil War, see [[XXI Corps (Union Army)]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Initially constituted on 2 December 1943 in the Army of the United States, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;XXI Corps&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was activated on 6 December 1943 at Camp Polk, [[Louisiana]]. XXI Corps fought for 116 days in the [[European Theater of Operations]], fighting from [[Alsace]] through southern Germany and into [[Austria]]. The corps was commanded in combat by [[Major General]] [[Frank W. Milburn]] as a subordinate unit of the [[U.S. Seventh Army|Seventh U.S. Army]].
==Eastern France==
The corps commenced combat operations in mid-January 1945 during pitched battle by the U.S. Seventh Army to regain ground lost to Germany&amp;apos;s [[Operation Nordwind]] New Year&amp;apos;s offensive into Alsace. From 25 January until 16 February 1945, XXI Corps was attached to the [[First Army (France)|French First Army]] and took part in bitter winter combat that ultimately collapsed the [[Colmar Pocket#Attack of the U.S. XXI Corps|Colmar Pocket]]. After a period of rest, the corps returned to the front on 28 February 1945 and pushed to the edge of the [[Siegfried Line]] during the first week of March, 1945.

==Germany and Austria==
On 20 March 1945, after five days of combat, the corps broke through the Siegfried Line and captured [[Saarbrücken]]. Crossing the Rhine behind the [[XV Corps (United States)|U.S. XV Corps]], the XXI Corps captured [[Würzburg]] on 5 April 1945, after a three-day battle marked by an assault across the [[Main River]]. Facing determined opposition, the corps fought its way into [[Schweinfurt]] on 12 April 1945, after five days of battle. Assaulting [[Fuerth]] on 18 April 1945, the corps seized [[Ansbach]] the following day and began a drive on the [[Danube River]], over which the corps seized an intact bridge at [[Dillingen an der Donau|Dillingen]] on 22 April 1945. On 28 April 1945, [[Augsburg]] fell to the XXI Corps, and on 1 May 1945, the corps seized [[Bad Tölz]] and captured German [[Field Marshal]] [[Gerd von Rundstedt]]. On 3 May 1945, the corps entered Austria, and advanced along the [[Inn River]] until German forces in the area unconditionally surrendered on 6 May 1945.

==Campaign credits and inactivation==
XXI Corps is credited with service in the Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe campaigns. XXI Corps Headquarters was inactivated in Germany on 30 September 1945. Subsequent to the [[Second World War]], the corps was active from September 1957 until June 1970. The post-Second World War activation and inactivation occurred at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, [[Pennsylvania]].
