        text="&lt;p&gt;{{for|the XXI Corps of the [[United States Army]] during the 20th &amp;amp;ndash; 21st Centuries|XXI Corps (United States)}}

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;XXI Corps&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[corps]] of the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].  It served as part of [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]]&amp;apos;s [[Army of the Cumberland]] and was in existence from January 9th to October 1863.

After the [[Battle of Stone&amp;apos;s River]], General Rosecrans reorganized the &amp;quot;wings&amp;quot; of his army into three corps.  The left wing, under [[Thomas L. Crittenden]], became the XXI Corps.

Taking part in the [[Tullahoma Campaign]], the XXI Corps was heavily engaged at [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]] on September 19&amp;amp;ndash;20, 1863, where it was nearly destroyed.  It was Rosecrans&amp;apos; mistaken decision to pull [[Thomas J. Wood|Thomas Wood]]&amp;apos;s division of this corps to support [[George Henry Thomas|George Thomas]]&amp;apos;s [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]] that resulted in General [[James Longstreet]]&amp;apos;s breakthrough against the Union center.  It should be added, though, that elements of XXI Corps, most notably [[William J. Palmer]]&amp;apos;s division, aided Thomas in his successful rearguard action on Snodgrass Hill.  Along with the remnants of [[XX Corps (Union Army)|XX Corps]], the corps reorganized into [[IV Corps (Union Army)|IV Corps]] shortly after the battle.
