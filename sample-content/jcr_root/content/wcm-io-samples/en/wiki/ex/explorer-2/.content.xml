&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Explorer 2&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;EXPLR2&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was to be a repeat of the [[Explorer&amp;amp;nbsp;1]] mission. However, due to a failure in the rocket during launch, the spacecraft did not reach orbit.

Explorer 2 was launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 26|LC-26A]] in [[Florida]] on March&amp;amp;nbsp;5, 1958 at 18:28 UTC, by a [[Juno-I]] launch vehicle.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;jsr&amp;quot;&amp;gt;

The Juno-I had its origins in the United States Army&amp;apos;s [[Project Orbiter]] in 1954. The project was canceled in 1955, when the decision was made to proceed with [[Project Vanguard]].

Following the launch of the Soviet [[Sputnik 1]] on October 4, 1957, the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA) was directed to proceed with the launching of a satellite using the Juno-I four-stage variant of the three-stage Jupiter-C, which had already been flight-tested in nose-cone re-entry tests for the [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter IRBM]] ([[intermediate-range ballistic missile]]). Working closely together, ABMA and [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) completed the job of modifying the Jupiter-C and building Explorer 1 in 84 days.

== Spacecraft design ==
Explorer 2 was equipped with a [[Geiger counter]] for the purposes of detecting [[cosmic ray]]s. After [[Explorer&amp;amp;nbsp;3]], it was decided that the original Geiger counter had been overwhelmed by strong radiation coming from a belt of charged particles trapped in space by the [[Earth&amp;apos;s magnetic field]] (see: [[Van Allen radiation belt]]). Explorer&amp;amp;nbsp;2 was also equipped with a wire grid array and an acoustic detector for the purpose of [[micrometeoroid|micrometeorite]] detection.

== Mission results ==
Explorer 2 failed to reach orbit after a malfunction in the Juno-I launch vehicle caused the fourth stage to not ignite.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://msl.jpl.nasa.gov/Programs/explorer.html| title = Mission and Spacecraft Library - Explorer Program | accessdate=2008-02-02 | publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
