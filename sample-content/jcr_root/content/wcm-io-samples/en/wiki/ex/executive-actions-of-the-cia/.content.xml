{{Redirect3|Executive action|For the 1973 film, see [[Executive Action (film)]].  &amp;quot;Executive action&amp;quot; may also mean, generally, an action taken by the [[executive branch]] of a government without [[legislative]] approval; for example, an [[executive order]]}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Executive Action&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a term used by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] starting in the early 1950s to refer to [[assassination]] operations.  These operations were often conducted by the CIA&amp;apos;s [[Division D]], a subsection of the agency&amp;apos;s Directorate of Operations.  &amp;quot;Executive Action&amp;quot; operations conducted by the CIA ranged from an attempt to kill [[Fidel Castro]] using a cigar injected with [[Botulism]] toxin to an alleged plan to kill rebel leader [[Che Guevara]].  The [[Ford administration]] forbade assassination in 1976 with [[Executive Order 11905]].  A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Washington Post]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; article, c. 1989{{Verify source|date=January 2010}}, reported that a &amp;apos;secret&amp;apos; ruling of the [[U.S. Department of State]]&amp;apos;s Office of Legal Advisor interpreted{{Verify source|date=January 2010}}  Ford&amp;apos;s Executive Order to ban only intentional killings of foreign leaders, thus clearing the way for &amp;apos;accidental&amp;apos; killings of foreign leaders -- for example, during the confusion of a coup or invasion.  As this ruling was one of at least four preceding the [[United States invasion of Panama|U.S. invasion of Panama]], some{{Who|date=January 2010}} saw the ruling as giving a green light for [[Manuel Noriega]] to be killed &amp;apos;accidentally.&amp;apos; Noriega survived the invasion and surrendered to US forces.
