[[File:Expo 1975 commemorative 100 Japanese yen coin.png|thumb|Japanese commemorative coin, 100 [[yen]], issued in 1975.  Shuri-mon, a historic site in Okinawa, is shown on the reverse.]]

Expo 75 was conceived, in part, to commemorate the American handover of [[Okinawa]] to [[Japan]] in 1972. The theme of the exposition was the oceans, and focused on [[oceanography|oceanographic]] technologies, [[marine biology|marine life]], and oceanic cultures. The motto was “The sea we would like to see&amp;quot; (Japanese: 海－その望ましい未来, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Umi - sono nozomashii mirai&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).

The event was located on the western end of the [[Motobu, Okinawa|Motobu Peninsula]], with a site area of 1,000,000 square metres (including sea areas). Thirty-seven nations participated, along with eight domestic and three international organizations. The keynote speaker on opening day was American author [[James A. Michener]].

==Highlights ==

The centerpiece of Expo 75 was the Aquapolis a floating city designed by Japanese architect [[Kiyonori Kikutake]]. It was envisioned as a concept of how humans could live harmoniously on the ocean, and a prototype for marine communities. The Aquapolis was constructed at a shipyard in [[Hiroshima]], Japan, and then towed to the Expo site. The facility was funded by the Japanese government, and cost 13 billion [[yen]]. It was thirty-two meters high, and had a one-hundred square meter deck.

The Expo Transit System featured two types of automated, electric transport vehicles: The &amp;quot;Expo New City Cars&amp;quot; (KRT) ran on a 3.7&amp;amp;nbsp;km track almost the whole length of the site, there were three stations. The Expo Future Cars (CVS) track was at the north end and connected the Fish Cluster with Expo Land via five stations.

==Post-Exposition ==

After the Expo was over, the site became [[Okinawa Commemorative National Government Park]] (国営沖縄記念公園), also known as [[Ocean Expo Park]]. Most of the exhibits were removed, although the Aquapolis was retained as an attraction and eventually hosted four million visitors. As years passed, the number of visitors to the Aquapolis declined and it was closed in 1993. In October 2000, the Aquapolis was towed away to [[Shanghai]] to be scrapped.

The [[Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium]] and [[Tropical &amp;amp; Subtropical Arboretum]] were later constructed on the site.
