&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Explorer 6&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1959-004A or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;S-2&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was a [[United States]] [[satellite]] launched on August 7, 1959. It was a small, spheroidal satellite designed to study trapped radiation of various energies, galactic [[cosmic ray]]s, [[Earth&amp;apos;s magnetic field|geomagnetism]], [[radio propagation]] in the [[Earth&amp;apos;s atmosphere|upper atmosphere]], and the [[flux]] of [[micrometeoroid|micrometeorites]]. It also tested a scanning device designed for photographing the [[Earth|Earth&amp;apos;s]] cloud cover, and transmitted the first pictures of Earth from [[orbit]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Space_Year_2007/SEMP4FEVL2F_0.html | title=50 years of Earth Observation | work=2007: A Space Jubilee | publisher=[[European Space Agency]] | date=October 3, 2007 | accessdate=2008-03-20}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;The U.S. [[V-2 rocket]] mission #12 had taken the first images of Earth from space on October 24, 1946.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The satellite was launched into a highly elliptical [[orbit]] with an initial local time of [[apsis|apogee]] of 2100 h. The satellite was [[spin-stabilized satellite|spin-stabilized]] at 2.8 rps, with the direction of the [[rotation|spin axis]] having a [[right ascension]] of 217 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] and a [[declination]] of 23 degrees. Four [[solar cell]] paddles mounted near its equator recharged the storage batteries while in orbit. Each experiment except the television scanner had two outputs, digital and analog. A [[UHF]] transmitter was used for the digital telemetry and the TV signal. Two [[VHF]] transmitters were used to transmit the analog signal. The VHF transmitters were operated continuously. The UHF transmitter was operated for only a few hours each day. Only three of the solar cell paddles fully erected, and this occurred during spin up rather than prior to spin up as planned. Consequently, initial operation of the payload power supply was 63% nominal, and this decreased with time. The decreased power caused a lower signal-to-noise ratio affecting most of the data, especially near apogee. One VHF transmitter failed on September 11, 1959, and the last contact with the payload was made on October 6, 1959, at which time the solar cell charging current had fallen below that required to maintain the satellite equipment.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdfo.org/stl/marcus.pdf |title=Earthbound Pioneer, Explorer 6 |author=Gideon Marcus |publisher=Quest, The History of Spaceflight Quarterly |volume=19 |number=1 |year=2012 |accessdate=25 June, 2013 }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1959 an [[anti-satellite missile]] test of the [[Bold Orion]] rocket used Explorer 6 as a target. The missile successfully passed within {{convert|6.4|km|mi|sp=us}} of the satellite.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

Bold Orion’s ASAT mission occurred on Tuesday, 13 October 1959.   Launch took place within the Atlantic Missile Range Drop Zone (AMR DZ).  The altitude, latitude and longitude of the drop point were 35,000 feet, 29 deg North and 79 deg West, respectively.  Bold Orion successfully intercepted the Explorer 6 satellite, passing its target at a range of less than 3.5&amp;amp;nbsp;nm and an altitude of 136&amp;amp;nbsp;nm.

The satellite&amp;apos;s orbit [[orbital decay|decayed]] on July 1, 1961.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;

A total of 827 hours of analog and 23 hours of digital data were obtained.
