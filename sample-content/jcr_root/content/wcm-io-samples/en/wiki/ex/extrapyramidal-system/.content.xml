In [[human anatomy]], the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;extrapyramidal system&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[neural network]] that is part of the [[motor system]] that causes involuntary reflexes and movement, and modulation of movement (i.e. coordination). The system is called &amp;quot;extrapyramidal&amp;quot; to distinguish it from the tracts of the motor cortex that reach their targets by traveling through the &amp;quot;[[Pyramid_of_medulla_oblongata|pyramids]]&amp;quot; of the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]]. The [[pyramidal tracts|pyramidal pathways]] ([[corticospinal]] and some [[corticobulbar]] tracts) may directly innervate motor neurons of the spinal cord or brainstem ([[anterior horn (spinal cord)|anterior (ventral) horn cells]] or certain cranial nerve nuclei), whereas the extrapyramidal system centers around the modulation and regulation (indirect control) of anterior (ventral) horn cells.

Extrapyramidal tracts are chiefly found in the [[reticular formation]] of the [[pons]] and [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]], and target neurons in the spinal cord involved in reflexes, locomotion, complex movements, and postural control. These tracts are in turn modulated by various parts of the central nervous system, including the [[nigrostriatal pathway]], the [[basal ganglia]], the [[cerebellum]], the [[vestibular nuclei]], and different sensory areas of the [[cerebral cortex]]. All of these regulatory components can be considered part of the extrapyramidal system, in that they modulate motor activity without directly innervating motor neurons.

Evolutionary, the extrapyramidal system appears to have emerged relatively recently and is most developed in species such as [[primates]] which require fine motor control. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; {{cite AV media

Such an organization, although indirect, reflects an evolutionary tendency to add new layers of refinement rather than risk drastically altering vital basic systems.


The extrapyramidal tracts include parts of the following:&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.amazon.com/BRS-Physiology-Board-Review-Series/dp/0781798760/&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
*[[rubrospinal tract]]
*[[pontine reticulospinal tract]]
*[[medullary reticulospinal tract]]
*[[lateral vestibulospinal tract]]
*[[tectospinal tract]]
