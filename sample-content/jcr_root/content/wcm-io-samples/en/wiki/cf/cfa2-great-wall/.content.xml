{{distinguish|Sloan Great Wall}}
The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Great Wall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Coma Wall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), sometimes specifically referred to as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;CfA2 Great Wall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is one of the largest known [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|super-structures]] in the [[Universe]], (the largest being the [[Huge-LQG]]). It is a [[galaxy filament|filament]] of [[galaxy|galaxies]] approximately 200 million [[light-year]]s away and has dimensions which measure over 500 million light-years long, 300 million light-years wide and 16 million light-years thick, and includes the [[Hercules Superclusters]], the [[Coma Supercluster]] and the [[Leo Cluster]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://hera.ph1.uni-koeln.de/~heintzma/kosmologie/GREATWLL.htm|title=THE GREAT WALL|last=Heintzmann|first=H.|date=2006-11-21|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

It was discovered in 1989 by [[Margaret Geller]] and [[John Huchra]] based on [[redshift survey]] data from the [[CfA Redshift Survey]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite journal

It is not known how much farther the wall extends due to the plane of the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]] in which [[Earth]] is located. The [[Interstellar medium|gas and dust]] from the Milky Way (known as the [[Zone of Avoidance]]) obscure the view of astronomers and have so far made it impossible to determine if the wall ends or continues on further than they can currently observe. The volume of the wall is estimated to be approximately 2.0318173e+45 km³{{Cn|date=June 2013}}.

In the [[ΛCDM|standard model]] of the evolution of the universe, such structures as the Great Wall form along and follow [[Galaxy filament|web-like strings]] of [[dark matter]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite book

}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is thought that this dark matter dictates the structure of the Universe on the grandest of scales. Dark matter gravitationally attracts [[baryonic]] matter, and it is this &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; matter that astronomers see forming long, thin walls of super-galactic clusters.
