&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;One Nation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-he|עם אחד}}, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Am Ehad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was a [[socialism|socialist]] [[political party]] in [[Israel]].

==History==
The party was established on 25 March 1999 when [[Amir Peretz]], [[Rafik Haj Yahia]], and [[Adisu Massala]] broke away from the [[Israeli Labor Party]] to form a new faction.&amp;lt;ref name=splits&amp;gt;[http://www.knesset.gov.il/faction/eng/FactionHistoryAll_eng.asp Mergers and Splits Among Parliamentary Groups] Knesset website&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In the [[Israeli legislative election, 1999|May 1999]] elections the party won 1.9% of the vote, equivalent to two seats, and was the smallest party to cross the [[electoral threshold]] of 1.5%. The seats were taken by Peretz and [[Haim Katz]]. Prior to the [[Israeli legislative election, 2003|2003 elections]] Katz left the party to join [[Likud]].

In the elections One Nation won three seats, taken by Peretz, [[Ilana Cohen]] and [[David Tal (Israeli politician)|David Tal]]. On 23 May 2005 the party merged back into the Labor Party,&amp;lt;ref name=splits/&amp;gt; although Tal refused to join and established his own faction, [[Noy]], which later merged into [[Kadima]].
