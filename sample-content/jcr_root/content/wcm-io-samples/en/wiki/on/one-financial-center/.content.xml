&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;One Financial Center&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a modern [[skyscraper]] adjacent to [[Dewey Square]] in the [[Financial District, Boston, Massachusetts|Financial District]]  of [[Boston, Massachusetts]].  Built in 1983, it is Boston&amp;apos;s [[List of tallest buildings in Boston|7th-tallest building]], standing 590 feet (180 meters) tall, and housing 46 floors. An unusual 90&amp;amp;nbsp;ft (27 m) tall glass-roofed lobby, known as the [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], occupies the first two stories. The remaining stories are offices, home to a number of [[law firms]], [[Certified Public Accountant]]s, and financial services companies.

The building is located on a historic 1.23-acre (5000 mÂ²) triangular piece of land next to [[South Station (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority)|South Station]] and the [[Federal Reserve Bank Building (Boston)|Federal Reserve Bank Building]], joining the [[Fort Point Channel]] area with Boston&amp;apos;s Financial District.

During the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]] (a project to create a new underground highway under the centre of Boston), extra care was needed to avoid [[subsidence]] of the soil under the building, as construction was underway just 25&amp;amp;nbsp;ft (7.6 m) from the building&amp;apos;s foundation.  The building was constructed on soil rather than [[bedrock]] due to the geography of the site.

The tower is topped off by two [[Radio masts and towers|radio masts]]. Including its radio masts, One Financial Center is the [[List of tallest buildings in Boston#Listing by Pinnacle Height|3rd-tallest building]] in Boston (when measuring by pinnacle height), rising 683 feet (208 meters). Apart from the masts and their supporting [[guy-wire|cables]], the roof of the building is flat with no crown.
