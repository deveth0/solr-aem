&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Onion Creek&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[Austin, Texas]] band embedded in the social and political movement of the [[1960s]] centering on ending [[poverty]] and the [[Vietnam War]], seeking [[equal human rights]]{{dn|date=February 2013}} for women and minorities, greater social and economic [[egalitarianism]], and the confrontation of the power of political and economic elites.  Almost all of their music was original material, most of it motivated by personal and [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] themes.  They played mostly at the [[Vulcan Gas Company]], a large, funky [[rock and roll]] concert venue that featured a bands primarily focused on either counter cultural material, [[folk rock]], or [[the blues]]. Onion Creek was one among four or five local bands who were part of a rotation of groups that played concerts there on a more or less monthly basis.

==History and Members==
The band evolved from the interaction of [[Terry Dyke]] and [[Robert Buck]]{{dn|date=February 2013}} regarding music, songwriting, the counter culture, and radical cultural change.  Both were singer-songwriters out of the folk tradition and had played in numerous groups in various types of music, including [[symphony orchestra]]s, [[opera]]s, [[country and western]] bands, folk groups, and [[progressive jazz]]{{dn|date=February 2013}} ensembles.  The group blossomed when [[Roland Denny]], who also had a rock, folk, and classical background, joined the group.  All three wrote or collaborated in writing and arranging all of the songs in the band&amp;apos;s repertoire.  The final member was [[drummer]] [[Larry Allen]].  Among other things, the group was known for its vocals.  All four members sang lead on some of the songs they performed, and most had complex harmony parts, including multiple-part [[a capella]] work.
