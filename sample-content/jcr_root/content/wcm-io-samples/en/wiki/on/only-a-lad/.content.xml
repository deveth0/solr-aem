&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Only a Lad&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the full-length debut album by [[Oingo Boingo]], released in 1981 following their [[Oingo Boingo (EP)|self-titled EP]]. The album&amp;apos;s musical arrangements, by vocalist [[Danny Elfman]] and guitarist [[Steve Bartek]], complete the group&amp;apos;s switch from a [[cabaret]] act to a [[New Wave music|New Wave]] band (see &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Oingo Boingo#The Mystic Knights years (1972-1980)|Oingo Boingo - The Mystic Knights Years]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Only a Lad&amp;apos;&amp;apos; features complex and frequently changing [[time signature]]s and [[Key (music)|key]]s, often incorporating [[harmony|harmonies]] borrowed from jazz and 20th-century classical music; all hallmarks of Elfman&amp;apos;s songwriting.

== Background ==

On the cover of the album, the drawing of a cat by [[Louis Wain]] that previously appeared on the cover of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Oingo Boingo (EP)|Oingo Boingo EP]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is visible on the shirt of the [[scouting|scout]]. The cover is a parody of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] 1960 official handbook.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W2TjcIoRCxA/TWK8TPnlChI/AAAAAAAAH5Q/vjW1s4-rYJg/s1600/BoyScoutBook01.jpg&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Lyrical content ==

The album&amp;apos;s lyrics are noticeably more comic and ironic than many of the band&amp;apos;s later releases. Some of the lyrics express [[right-wing]] political views, which Elfman had at the time, but no longer supports.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.boingo.org/articles/Encyclopedia.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The nature of some of the songs featured on the album generated mild controversy, such as the opening track &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Little Girls&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of which the music video was banned in Canada.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://graveyard-duck.com/images/boingo82c.png&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; On songs such as &amp;quot;Little Girls&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Capitalism&amp;quot;, Elfman has since stated that his intentions were to write in jest from the perspective of various disreputable characters, adding he was &amp;quot;out to offend everybody&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite video | year = 2010 | title = Danny Elfman at Comic Con Part 3 | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sFK7yn0Atc | language = English | publisher = 9FingeredElf | location = San Diego, California | accessdate = 2012-02-22}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Reception ==

The commercial and critical success of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Only A Lad&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was limited; however, largely due to the backing of Los Angeles radio station [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]], it established Oingo Boingo as a permanent fixture in the [[Southern California]] music scene.

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[National Review]] Online&amp;apos;&amp;apos; named &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Capitalism&amp;apos;&amp;apos; as one of the &amp;quot;50 greatest conservative rock songs&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NzZkNDU5MmViNzVjNzkzMDE3NzNlN2MyZjRjYTk4YjE |title=&amp;quot;Rockin&amp;apos; the Right&amp;quot;: The 50 greatest conservative rock songs. |accessdate=2007-12-25 |last=Miller |first=John J. |coauthors= |date=May 26, 2006 |work= |publisher=[[National Review]]}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Capitalism&amp;apos;&amp;apos; featured in the film &amp;quot;[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]&amp;quot; (2005). &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Only a Lad&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a playable track on the [[PlayStation 2]] video game &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
