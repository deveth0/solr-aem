The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ontario Provincial Confederation of Regions Party&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a minor political party in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], the provincial branch of the now-defunct [[Confederation of Regions Party of Canada]]. The party was founded in 1989, around the time the federal CoR was dissolved, and remains the last Confederation of Regions Party in Canada.

The CoR survives only in Ontario, though the original &amp;apos;&amp;apos;raison d&amp;apos;etre&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of the federal CoR was to promote the rights of regions other than [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]].

== Party platform ==

The party campaigns on the promotion of [[direct democracy]], protection of [[Department of Canadian Heritage|Canadian heritage]] and [[Sustainability|environmental sustainability]], while opposing [[urban sprawl]] onto farmland, &amp;apos;[[big business]]&amp;apos; and [[unionization]]. The party&amp;apos;s proposed health care plan would &amp;quot;give individuals more responsibility over their own health care&amp;quot;, however, it would not support a [[two tier health care]] system.

If elected, the party would hold a referendum on the [[French Language Services Act]], and halt all [[multicultural]] funding.

In the [[Ontario general election, 1990|1990 election]], CoR candidates in [[Algoma (provincial electoral district)|Algoma]], [[Cochrane South]], [[Nickel Belt (provincial electoral district)|Nickel Belt]], [[Sudbury (provincial electoral district)|Sudbury]], [[Sudbury East]] and [[Sault Ste. Marie (provincial electoral district)|Sault Ste. Marie]] placed ahead of [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party]] candidates. The party has since declined in popularity, receiving less than 0.01% of the popular vote in the 2007 election.

== Party leaders ==
[[Dean Wasson]] has been the party&amp;apos;s only leader, heading the party in the 1990 election. The party has not fielded a leader in any subsequent election, considering itself to be a [[grass roots]] organization, and will choose a leader if a [[caucus]] is won. The party&amp;apos;s one candidate is nominated in the 2003 election - [[Richard Butson]] - is, however, often cited as the [[de facto]] leader.
