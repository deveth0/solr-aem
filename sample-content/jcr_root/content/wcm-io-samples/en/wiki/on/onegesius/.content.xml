&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Onegesius&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Priscus]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Όνηγήσιος&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was a noble of [[Huns|Hunnic]] or [[Scythian]] origin and one of the principal advisers of [[Attila the Hun]].
Onegesius was Western Roman. He was captured and [[Attila the Hun]] spared his life and brought him to the capital to join his court.
Onegesius served Attila the Hun&amp;apos;s as his architect. Attila ordered him to build a Roman bath in the Hun capital - [[Jászberény]]. Since the city was in the middle of the [[Great Hungarian Plan]] and that part of the country had no stones or trees, they had to transport the stones and timber from [[Pannonia]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ReferenceA&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Priscus at the court of Attila Translation by J.B. Bury (Priscus, fr. 8 in Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

When the bath was ready, Attila was so pleased, he appointed him as his bath master and main architect.
Soon after, he married a noble [[Scythian]] woman.

After this Attila made him his Minister and Warlord.
