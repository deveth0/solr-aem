        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;One World&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a travelogue written by [[Wendell Willkie]], a [[liberal Republican]], and originally published in 1943.

==Content of the book==
It is a document of his world travels and meetings with many of the [[Allied|Allies]]&amp;apos; heads of state as well as ordinary citizens and soldiers in locales such as [[El Alamein]], [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Russia]], and [[Iran]]. Willkie also discusses the need for some sort of [[world government]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Campbell Craig &amp;apos;The Resurgent Idea of World Government&amp;apos;, Ethics &amp;amp; International Affairs, Volume 22, Issue 2, Date: Summer 2008, Pages: 133-142.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Especially emphasized is the position of [[China]] in the world after [[World War II]]; involved in a [[civil war]] between Nationalists and Communists, Willkie prophesies that whichever power achieves victory will make China a force to be reckoned with. It is the duty of the United Nations (the [[Allies]]&amp;lt;ref group=&amp;quot;note&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Before the [[United Nations Organization]] was founded in 1945, the term &amp;quot;United Nations&amp;quot; had been in use since 1942 as a synonym for the Allies.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; to make sure that the power is friendly to American and other Allied interests but also that it is powerful enough to help the Chinese, the world&amp;apos;s most populated nation.

==Popularity==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;One World&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was highly popular in its time and sold millions of copies. It spent four months  atop the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;New York Times&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[New York Times Best Seller list|bestseller list]] beginning in May 1943.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[John Bear]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992, p. 8.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Use as political slogan==
Ever since the [[second red scare]] of the early 1950s, [[right wing]] and [[extreme right]] political organizations in the [[United States]] such as the [[John Birch Society]] have used the term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;One Worlder&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to attack [[liberals]] and anyone else they feel might be in favor of world government because they fear what they call the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order conspiracy]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
