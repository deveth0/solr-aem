The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ontario general election, 1867&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the first [[general election]] held in the newly created Province of [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Previously, the territory was known as [[Canada West]], a part of the [[Province of Canada]].  The election was held on September 3, 1867, to elect the 82 members of the [[1st Legislative Assembly of Ontario|1st Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs).  The dates of the election in 1867 varied from August 20 to September 26.

The [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Conservative Party]], led by [[John Sandfield Macdonald]], and the [[Ontario Liberal Party]], led by [[Archibald McKellar]], each won 41 seats. A [[coalition government]] was formed under the leadership of Macdonald.
