        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oncotic pressure&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;colloid osmotic pressure&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a form of [[osmotic pressure]] exerted by [[protein]]s in a blood vessel&amp;apos;s plasma (blood/liquid) that usually tends to pull [[water]] into the circulatory system. It is the opposing force to [[hydrostatic pressure]].

Throughout the body, dissolved compounds have an [[osmotic pressure]].  Because large [[Blood proteins|plasma proteins]] cannot easily cross through the [[capillary]] walls, their effect on the osmotic pressure of the capillary interiors will, to some extent, balance out the tendency for fluid to leak out of the capillaries. In other words, the oncotic pressure tends to pull fluid into the capillaries. In conditions where plasma proteins are reduced, e.g. from being lost in the [[urine]] ([[proteinuria]]) or from [[malnutrition]], there will be a reduction in oncotic pressure and an increase in filtration across the capillary, resulting in excess fluid buildup in the tissues ([[edema]]).

The large majority of oncotic pressure in capillaries is generated by the presence of high quantities of [[albumin]] which constitute approximately 80% of the total oncotic pressure exerted by blood plasma on interstitial fluid.  The total oncotic pressure of an average capillary is about 28 mmHg with albumin contributing approximately 22 mmHg of this oncotic pressure.  Because blood proteins cannot escape through capillary endothelium, oncotic pressure of capillary beds tends to draw water into the vessels.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book |last1=Guyton |first1=Arthur |last2=Hall |first2=John |editor1-first=Rebecca |editor1-last=Gruliow |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |format=Book |edition=11th |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier Inc. |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=0-7216-0240-1 |pages=187–188  |chapter=Chapter 16: The Microcirculation and the Lymphatic System}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Oncotic pressure is represented by the symbol [[Π]] or [[π]] in the [[Starling equation]] and elsewhere.

In the clinical setting, there are two types of fluids that are used for intravenous drips: crystalloids and [[colloids]]. Crystalloids are aqueous [[solution]]s of mineral salts or other water-soluble molecules. Colloids contain larger insoluble molecules, such as [[gelatin]].
Oncotic pressure values are approximately 290 mosm per kg of water, which slightly differs from the osmotic pressure of the blood that has values approximating 300 mmol/l.
