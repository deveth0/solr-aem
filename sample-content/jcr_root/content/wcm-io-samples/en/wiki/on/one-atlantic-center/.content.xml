&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;One Atlantic Center&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;IBM Tower&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a [[skyscraper]] located in [[Midtown Atlanta]].  It is the third-tallest in [[Atlanta]], reaching a height of {{convert|820|ft|m}} with 50 stories of [[office]] space.  It was completed in 1987 and remained the tallest building in Atlanta until 1992, when it was surpassed by the [[Bank of America Plaza (Atlanta)|Bank of America Plaza]], which was also built in Midtown. It was also the tallest building in the southeastern U.S. at the time of completion, surpassing the [[Southeast Financial Center]] in [[Miami]].

The building was commissioned by [[Prentiss Properties]] as a southeastern headquarters for [[IBM]], a company responsible for many notable skyscrapers of the 1980s.  Aside from introducing Atlanta to the postmodern architectural idiom of the 80s, this tower is notable for essentially creating what is now the Midtown commercial district.  Located at the then-remote corner of 14th and West Peachtree Streets over a mile from [[Downtown Atlanta|Downtown]], this building nevertheless opened nearly fully occupied and thus attracted developers to Midtown in droves.

The building&amp;apos;s exterior consists of Spanish pink [[granite]] with a copper pyramidal top and gold peak. The design includes [[Gothic Architecture|gothic]] flourishes, most noticeably below the copper top of the building. At night the peak and ridges along the top are illuminated brightly, creating a glowing effect.

It was joined in 2001 by the much shorter [[Atlantic Center Plaza]] building, which bears similar postmodern design and was constructed across the street as the second phase of the Atlantic Center development.  Atlantic Center Plaza&amp;apos;s design and architecture are so similar, it has affectionately become known in Atlanta as the &amp;quot;Mini Me&amp;quot; building, named after the comical dwarfish clone of Dr. Evil in the Austin Powers movies. Phase III sits on the drawing boards as the developers await a tenant.

One Atlantic Center was designed by [[Johnson/Burgee Architects]]. As associate architect, [[Heery International]], Inc. produced the contract documents.

Both Atlantic Center Towers were constructed by HCBeck, now known as [[The Beck Group]].
