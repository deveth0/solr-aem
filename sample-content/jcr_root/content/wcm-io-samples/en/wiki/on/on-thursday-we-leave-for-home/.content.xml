&amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;On Thursday We Leave for Home&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; is an episode of the [[American television]] anthology series &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Twilight Zone]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Plot==
Thirty years before, in 1991, an expedition to the hellish [[desert planet]] V9-Gamma was stranded, and the people had no choice but to begin their own small settlement there. The group&amp;apos;s leader, Captain Benteen, has maintained a [[totalitarian]] grip upon his group; he believes that this strict discipline prevents them from giving up hope in the harsh, unyielding environment.  When a rescue mission from Earth finally arrives, Benteen is at first as jubilant as the others, but then he begins to raise objections to leaving the planet behind. When he realizes that the colonists do not want to stay in a group on their return to Earth, he tries to persuade them to stay. Everyone else chooses to return home, but Benteen announces that he will remain behind alone if he must.

On the day the people board the ship, the rescue mission&amp;apos;s Colonel Sloane and Benteen&amp;apos;s second-in-command, Al Baines, search for Benteen to give him one last chance to change his mind, but he is nowhere to be found. After they give up and leave, Benteen emerges from the top of the cave that had sheltered his people. As the ship prepares for takeoff, Benteen talks to his people as if they are still there. Then, remembering the beauty of Earth, he realizes that he is alone and wants to go home. He rushes out screaming for the ship to come back, but it is too late. He is now stranded on V9-Gamma for the rest of his life, completely alone in the barren, lifeless deserts.

==Production notes==
The rescue crew&amp;apos;s ship and uniforms were leftover props from MGM&amp;apos;s 1956 film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Forbidden Planet]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
