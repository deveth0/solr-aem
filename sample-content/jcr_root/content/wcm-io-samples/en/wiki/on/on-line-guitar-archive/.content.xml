        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;On-line Guitar Archive&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;OLGA&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was the first Internet library of guitar and bass [[tablature]], or &amp;quot;tabs&amp;quot;. Born from a collection of guitarist internet-forum archives, it was a useful resource for musicians of all genres for over a decade.

==History==
The website began its life in the newsgroups &amp;apos;&amp;apos;rec.music.makers.guitar.tablature&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.music.makers.guitar.tablature?hl=en] and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;alt.guitar.tab&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.guitar.tab?hl=en], where users would post tabs they had written or requests for tabs of certain songs or artists. The problem was that after a few days, the contents of the forum would be &amp;apos;&amp;apos;aged&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (i.e. removed). Around 1992 the posts were collected together by [[James Bender]] at [[UNLV]] into an [[ftp]] site that later became &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;www.OLGA.net&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In 1994 [[Cathal Woods]] took over the project as archivist.

In 1996, [[EMI|EMI Publishing]] filed a complaint with UNLV, claiming that the archive was in breach of [[Copyright|copyright law]] with songs they had the rights to. Although OLGA was never threatened directly, UNLV kicked the project off its server. Then in 1998, after a new home for the site was found, OLGA received a similar copyright complaint from the [[Harry Fox Agency]]. As a result, OLGA was forced to shut down, re-emerging later as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;OLGA incorporated&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a registered non-profit organization dedicated to preserving the archive and providing for its bandwidth. The site prior to this final move was preserved as &amp;quot;the old archive,&amp;quot; and contributions since the move were stored in &amp;quot;the new archive&amp;quot;.

In June 2006 they received a [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act|take down]] letter from lawyers representing the [[National Music Publishers Association|NMPA]] and the [[Music Publishers&amp;apos; Association|MPA]][http://olga.net], although by this time temporary clones of the archive had started to appear on sites such as Renegade Olga.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://yro.slashdot.org/story/01/01/02/2222248/lawyers-close-up-renegade-olga&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The future of free sites like OLGA is in doubt as the Harry Fox Agency has begun a contract with [[Musicnotes.com]] to license many popular songs for free chord sheets, tablature, lyrics, and sheet music dissemination.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070402-legal-guitar-tabs-return-to-the-web.html Legal guitar tabs return to the web&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Contributions==
To be a candidate for the archive, a file was required to be the author&amp;apos;s own work (i.e., interpretation of how to play the song) and cannot have been derived from a published music book, otherwise inclusion in OLGA would have constituted a copyright violation.

==Current status==
In 2006, the Archive removed all 34,000 tablatures on the site.&amp;lt;ref name=bbc&amp;gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5305520.stm?ls &amp;quot;Discord over guitar sites&amp;quot;] by Jonathan Duffy from the [[BBC News]], Sept. 1, 2006&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; A note posted on the site indicated that those running the site had received &amp;quot;a &amp;apos;take down&amp;apos; letter from lawyers representing the [[National Music Publishers Association]] and the Music Publishers&amp;apos; Association&amp;quot;, according to the linked letter on the front page.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.olga.net/ The On-Line Guitar Archive&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In the letter it is stated that OLGA &amp;quot;makes available tablature versions of copyrighted musical compositions owned or controlled by members of the NMPA and MPA&amp;quot; &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.olga.net/060621-nmpa-p1of6.jpg&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Although originally a notice on the site suggested that the shutdown would only be temporary while OLGA attempted to resolve legal issues, the long time archivist for the site has indicated that the situation is permanent.  On a personal web site he stated, &amp;quot;For twelve years I ran OLGA - the On-Line Guitar Archive. RIP.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref name=woods&amp;gt;[http://facultystaff.vwc.edu/~rwoods/other.htm comment at Cathal Woods faculty page] (retrieved 11-28-2007)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

As of late 2012 the site appears to have been taken offline.
