{{wiktionary|one-upmanship}}

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;One-upmanship&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the art or practice of successively outdoing a competitor.

Exactly when the term originated is unknown; several examples are known from the early 1900s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;See &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Debates: Official Report&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1903, 6: 6115, Canadian Parliament, House of Commons.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was used in the title of a book by [[Stephen Potter]], published in 1952&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;In full, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;One-Upmanship: Being Some Account of the Activities and Teachings of the Lifemanship Correspondence College of One-Upness and Games Lifemastery&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; as a follow-up to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Theory and Practice of [[Gamesmanship]] (or the Art of Winning Games without Actually Cheating)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1947), which also contained the term,&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;vqr&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1993/autumn/lowrey-timelessness/ &amp;quot;The Timelessness of Stephen Potter&amp;apos;s Gamesmanship&amp;quot; by Burling Lowrey. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Virginia Quarterly Review&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Autumn 1993 pp. 718â€“726]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Lifemanship&amp;apos;&amp;apos; titles in his series of [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[self-help book]]s, and film and television derivatives, that teach various ploys to achieve this. This satire of [[self-help]] style guides manipulates traditional stuffy British conventions for the gamester, all life being a game, who understands that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;if you&amp;apos;re not one-up, you&amp;apos;re one-down.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Potter&amp;apos;s unprincipled principles apply to almost any possession, experience or situation, deriving maximum undeserved rewards and discomforting the opposition. The 1960 film [[School for Scoundrels (1960 film)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;School for Scoundrels&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] and the 2006 film [[School for Scoundrels (2006 film)|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;School For Scoundrels&amp;apos;&amp;apos;]] were satiric portrayals of how to use Potter&amp;apos;s ideas.

In that context, the term refers to a [[satiric]] course in the [[gambit]]s required for the systematic and conscious practice of &amp;quot;creative intimidation&amp;quot;, making one&amp;apos;s associates feel inferior and thereby gaining the status of being &amp;quot;one-up&amp;quot; on them. Viewed seriously, it is a phenomenon of [[group dynamics]] that can have significant effects in the [[management]] field: for instance, manifesting in [[office politics]]. The term has been extended to a generic, often punning extension, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;upmanship&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, used for any assertion of superiority: for instance, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&amp;amp;cmd=retrieve&amp;amp;dopt=abstract&amp;amp;list_uids=9115730 Photon upmanship], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/cheltenham_festival/queen_mother_champion_chase/1846476.stm Native Upmanship], and so on.
