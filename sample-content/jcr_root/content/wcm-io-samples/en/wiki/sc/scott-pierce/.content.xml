&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Scott Pierce II&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 1930, [[New York City]]) is the youngest child of [[Marvin Pierce|Marvin]] and Pauline (Robinson) Pierce, and brother of former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Barbara Bush (First Lady)|Barbara Bush]], wife of [[George Herbert Walker Bush]] and uncle of the 43rd President [[George W. Bush]]. Pierce is named for his grandfather, who was an insurance salesman in Dayton, [[Ohio]]. His father was chairman of [[McCall Corporation]].  Upon graduation from [[Miami University]] and marriage to Janice Chamberlaine in 1954, he joined [[Phelps, Fenn and Company]], a prominent [[municipal bond]] house. In 1966, Pierce was made a partner of [[G. H. Walker &amp;amp; Co.]], a company founded by George H. W. Bush&amp;apos;s grandfather, [[George Herbert Walker]]. He left the firm in 1974 to join [[Blyth, Eastman, Dillon and Company]] as a senior vice president of [[public finance]]. In the fall of 1975, he moved to [[E. F. Hutton|E. F. Hutton &amp;amp; Co.]] where in 1982 he became President.

Prior to his election, some Hutton offices engaged in an aggressive cash management scheme. On May 2, 1985 the company pleaded guilty to 2,000 counts of mail fraud; Mr. Pierce was in no way implicated in the scandal.  Pierce left the company two years later to head [[PAMCO]], a division of [[Prudential Financial|Prudential]]. He is currently retired and serving as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees for [[Manhattanville College]].
