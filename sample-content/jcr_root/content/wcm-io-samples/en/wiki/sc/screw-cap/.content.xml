==Usage==
A screw closure is a mechanical device which is screwed on and off of a &amp;quot;finish&amp;quot; on a [[Packaging and labelling|container]]. Either continuous threads or lugs are used.  It must be engineered to be cost-effective, to provide an effective seal (and barrier), to be compatible with the contents, to be easily opened by the consumer, often to be reclosable, and to comply with product, package, and environmental laws and regulations.  Some closures need to be [[tamper resistance|tamper resistant]] and have [[child-resistant packaging]] features.

==Wine Industry==
{{main|Screw cap (wine)}}
Its use as an [[alternative wine closure]] is gaining increasing support as an alternative to [[cork (material)|cork]] for sealing [[wine]] bottles. A screw cap is a [[metal]] cap that screws onto threads on the neck of a [[bottle]], generally with a metal skirt down the neck to resemble the traditional [[wine capsule]] (&amp;quot;foil&amp;quot;). A layer of [[plastic]] (often [[PVDC]]), cork, [[rubber]], or other soft material is used as wad&amp;lt;!-- &amp;quot;wad&amp;quot; is the term of art --&amp;gt; to make a seal with the mouth of the bottle.

==Sake industry==
[[Sake]] bottles are almost universally closed with screw caps (some are packed in barrels, or novelty bottles).
