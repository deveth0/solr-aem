&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Schokland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (municipality [[Noordoostpolder]]) is a former island in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Zuiderzee]]. Schokland lost its status as an island when the Noordoostpolder was reclaimed from the sea in 1942. The remains are still visible as a slightly elevated part in the [[polder]] and by the still partly intact [[retaining wall]] of the waterfront of &amp;apos;Middelbuurt&amp;apos;.

As a result from the increasing sea-level Schokland transformed from an attractive settlement area in the [[Middle Ages]] to a place under continuous threat by floods in the 19th century. By that time the Schoklanders had retreated to the three most elevated parts, Emmeloord, Molenbuurt, and Middelbuurt. A major flood in 1825 brought massive destruction, and in 1859 the government decided to end permanent settlement on Schokland. The former municipality of Schokland was joined to [[Kampen (Overijssel)|Kampen]] on the mainland.

Today Schokland is a popular archeological site and host to the Schokland Museum. Schokland was the first [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in the [[Netherlands]]. According to [[Statistics Netherlands]], there are five people living on the former island.
