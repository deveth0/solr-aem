&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Schizophrenia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the second studio album by [[Brazil]]ian [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Sepultura]], released in 1987 through [[Cogumelo Records]]. It is the first album for the band with [[Andreas Kisser]]. The album&amp;apos;s sound leans more towards the thrash metal genre than the previous album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Morbid Visions]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which is closer to death metal. All songs were recorded during August 1987, except for the bonus track &amp;quot;Troops of Doom&amp;quot; which was recorded during August 26â€“27, 1990.

In America the band sent radio playlists at a time when they were struggling to book gigs because club owners were afraid to book them due to their style.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Phoenix Times 1993-05-12&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news|last=Baird|first=Robert|title=The Boys from Brazil Transplanted to Phoenix, Sepultura Strives for Death Metal with a Conscience|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/content/printVersion/160396|accessdate=2010-08-03|newspaper=Phoenix New Times|date=1993-05-12}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  [[Roadrunner Records]] signed them and released &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Schizophrenia&amp;apos;&amp;apos; internationally before seeing the band perform in person.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;MTV&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=Sepultura|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/sepultura/artist.jhtml#biographyEnd|publisher=MTV|accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Colon 1991-08-07&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite news|last=Colon|first=Suzan|title=Name That Tomb|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/content/printVersion/233397|accessdate=2010-08-02|newspaper=Miami New Times|date=1991-08-01}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Musical style==

Kisser states that, when he joined Sepultura in &amp;apos;87, he

{{cquote|...brought in some new influences - traditional heavy metal and a more melodic style. It was an immediate meeting of minds. We understood where each other was coming from musically and we knew we could find a way to put all our influences together and make the music work.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Shapiro, 1993, page 14.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;}}
