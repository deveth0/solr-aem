&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Schaefer Beer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a brand of American [[beer]] first produced in 1842 by the [[F. &amp;amp; M. Schaefer Brewing Company]].  Schaefer Beer is billed as America&amp;apos;s oldest lager beer by its brewers.

Until the mid-1970s, Schaefer Beer was the world&amp;apos;s best selling beer before ceding the top spot to [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]]. The brand was purchased by [[Stroh Brewery Company]] in 1981, and since 1999 has been produced by [[Pabst Brewing Company]] after Stroh was purchased by Pabst in 1999.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Schaefer&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schaefer-beer.com/history/|title=History of Schaefer Beer|publisher=Schaefer Beer|accessdate=2012-04-09}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Advertising campaigns==

The advertising slogan for Schaefer beer is &amp;quot;Schaefer is the one beer to have when you&amp;apos;re having more than one.&amp;quot; An earlier advertising campaign from the 1950s asserted, &amp;quot;What do you hear in the best of circles? Schaefer, all around!&amp;quot;

During the 1970s and 1980s, Schaefer beer was one of the top selling beers in [[Puerto Rico]]. A large and quite famous Schaefer beer billboard was once displayed at the main entrance to the city of [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico|Bayamón]]. It became quite famous among Puerto Rican salsa fans and superstars like [[Frankie Ruiz]], [[Tito Rojas]], and [[Lalo Rodríguez]].

Schaefer beer had major exhibitions at both of New York City&amp;apos;s World&amp;apos;s Fairs, held in [[Flushing Meadows Park]]. During both the [[1939 New York World&amp;apos;s Fair]] and the [[1964 New York World&amp;apos;s Fair]], Schaefer sponsored &amp;quot;Schaefer Center&amp;quot;, a restaurant that used beer as an ingredient in many dishes.

An illuminated Schaefer beer advertisement once appeared in the outfield of [[Ebbets Field]]. If a player reached first base on a hit, the letter &amp;quot;h&amp;quot; would light up and if the official scorer ruled that a player reached first base due to an error, the &amp;quot;e&amp;quot; would light up.
