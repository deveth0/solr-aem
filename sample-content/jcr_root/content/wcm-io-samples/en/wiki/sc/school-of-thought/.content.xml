A  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;school of thought&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a collection or group of people who share common characteristics of [[opinion]] or outlook of a [[philosophy]], [[List of academic disciplines|discipline]], [[belief]], [[social movement]], [[economics]], [[cultural movement]], or [[art movement]].

Schools are often characterized by their currency, and thus classified into &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; schools. This dichotomy is often a component of [[paradigm shift]]. However, it is rarely the case that there are only two schools in any given field.

Schools are often named after their founders such as the &amp;quot;[[Rinzai school]]&amp;quot; of [[Zen]] named after [[Linji Yixuan]] and the [[Asharite]] school of [[early Muslim philosophy]] named after [[Abu l&amp;apos;Hasan al-Ashari]]. They are often also named after their places of origin, such as the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School]] of [[philosophy]] that originated in [[Ionia]] and the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago school]] of [[architecture]] that originated in [[Chicago, Illinois]] and the [[Prague School]] of linguistics, named after a linguistic circle found in Prague, or [[Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School]] whose representatives lived in [[Tartu]] and [[Moscow]].
