&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xue Jinghua&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born October 7, 1946 ) (Chinese: 薛菁华; [[pinyin]]: Xūe Jīnghúa) is a [[China|Chinese]] [[ballerina]] who was cast in the now internationally well-known [[Red Detachment of Women]] of the [[National Ballet of China]] as Wu Qinghua, the heroine of the [[ballet]] for which she became a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[prima ballerina]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The film version of the ballet was released in [[1971 in China]], five years into the [[Cultural Revolution]]. As one of the [[Eight model plays]], the film was shown across the country in every cinema, every factory, and every village in the following several years until 1976 when the [[Cultural Revolution]] officially ended. As a consequence of the film, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xue Jinghua&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; achieved a nationwide fame. [[Liu Qingtang]] was cast as Hong Changqing in the ballet and the film version of it.

When [[Richard Nixon]], the 37th [[President of the United States]], visited China in 1972, he was entertained with a stage production of [[Red Detachment of Women]], and Xue Jinghua performed as Wu Qinghua in the ballet.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=5wbZFMfhpWkC&amp;amp;pg=PA119&amp;amp;dq=Xue+Jinghua&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=zne7Td33EYqUvAOjmbzaBQ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=3&amp;amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Xue%20Jinghua&amp;amp;f=false The poetics of difference and displacement] p119&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
