&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xu Rong&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (died 192) was a military general serving under the warlord [[Dong Zhuo]] during the late [[Han Dynasty]] of [[China]].

==Biography==
Xu Rong was originally from Xuantu commandery (玄菟郡) of You Province. In the year 190, when [[Yuan Shao]] led the [[campaign against Dong Zhuo]], Xu Rong successively defeated the forces of [[Cao Cao]] and [[Sun Jian]], who were part of the alliance to put down Dong Zhuo.

When Dong Zhuo was assassinated by [[Lü Bu]] and [[Wang Yun]], Xu Rong served Wang Yun in the new government. Afterwards, Li Jue and [[Guo Si]], former generals under Dong Zhuo, led an army and attacked [[Chang&amp;apos;an]]. Xu Rong, along with his ally [[Hu Zhen]], went out to do battle against the invading army. Xu Rong, however, was defeated and slain in battle.

==In fiction==
The historical novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a dramatic novelization of the events of the Three Kingdoms era. In it, after Dong Zhuo moved his capital from [[Luoyang]] to Chang&amp;apos;an, Cao Cao set off in pursuit of Dong Zhuo&amp;apos;s forces. According to the story, Xu Rong intercepted Cao Cao&amp;apos;s army but Cao Cao&amp;apos;s trusted general [[Xiahou Dun]] impaled him with a spear. In recorded history, Xu Rong&amp;apos;s ambush of Cao Cao was successful, and Cao Cao would have been killed if he had not been rescued by his cousin, [[Cao Hong]].
