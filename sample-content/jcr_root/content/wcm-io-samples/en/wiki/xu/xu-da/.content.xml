{{Chinese name|[[Xu (surname)|Xu]]}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xu Da&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|t=徐達}}) (1332–1385) was a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[General officer|military general]] who lived in the early [[Ming Dynasty]] and contributed to the founding of the dynasty. Apart from being a friend of the [[Hongwu Emperor]], founding emperor of the dynasty, Xu was also the father of [[Empress Renxiaowen|Empress Xu]], who would marry the third ruler of the Ming, the [[Yongle Emperor]].

==Biography==
Xu joined the [[Red Turban Rebellion|Red Turban rebels]] in 1353 to overthrow the [[Mongolia]]n-ruled [[Yuan Dynasty]] in [[China]]. He was placed under the command of Zhu Yuanzhang (future [[Hongwu Emperor]] of the [[Ming Dynasty]]) and he helped Zhu conquer several regional warlords. In 1369, two years after the founding the Ming Dynasty, Xu, along with various deputies, led an attack on the Yuan capital city of [[Beijing]] and forced the last Yuan ruler, [[Ukhaantu Khan, Emperor Huizong of Yuan|Emperor Huizong]], to flee northward.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;britannica&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/273994/Xu-Da &amp;quot;Xu Da.&amp;quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 09 Oct. 2008]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Xu led a pursuit on the retreating Yuan forces and he encountered [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seonggye]] (founder of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] in [[Korea]]), who was commanded to take out the Chinese army. Xu&amp;apos;s presence struck fear into the Korean generals, who in turn, allied themselves with the Chinese instead. Afterwards, Xu&amp;apos;s army entered Mongolian territory and routed Mongol reinforcements throughout the empire. Eventually, Xu&amp;apos;s force sacked the Mongolian capital at [[Karakorum]],&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;britannica&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; and captured thousands of Mongol nobles in 1370. His army ventured to [[Transbaikalia]] and reached the furthest north that any other Chinese army had never reached before.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;britannica&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

Xu died in 1385 under mysterious circumstances. He was not accused of plotting an assassination on the Hongwu Emperor, although many others who contributed to the Ming Dynasty&amp;apos;s founding had been put to death by the emperor for allegedly plotting rebellions. In legend, an illness made Xu [[Allergy|allergic]] to [[goose]] and the Hongwu Emperor sent him goose to eat, ensuring that Xu ate it and died.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Deng, Yinke&amp;apos;&amp;apos;History of China&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Beijing : China Intercontinental Press, 2007. ISBN 978-7-5085-1098-9 pp.131-132&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Popular culture==
{{See also|List of The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber characters}}
Xu Da is featured as a character in [[Jin Yong|Louis Cha]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Wuxia]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. As a member of the anti-[[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] [[Ming Cult]], Xu participated actively in the rebellions to overthrow the Yuan Dynasty, together with [[Hongwu Emperor|Zhu Yuanzhang]], [[Chang Yuchun]] and others, under the leadership of [[Zhang Wuji]]. Zhang passes Xu the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Book of Wumu]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a textbook on military strategies written by the [[Song Dynasty]] general [[Yue Fei]], and Xu benefits greatly from reading the book. Xu becomes a brilliant military commander and leads the rebels to victory in the battles against the Yuan forces. He later aids [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] in founding the [[Ming Dynasty]] in China.
