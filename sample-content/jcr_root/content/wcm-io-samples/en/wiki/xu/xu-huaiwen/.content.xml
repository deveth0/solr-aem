{{Chinese name|[[Xu (surname)|Xu]]}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xu Huaiwen&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|t=徐懷雯|p=Xú Huáiwén|s=徐怀雯}}; born August 2, 1975 in [[Guiyang]], [[Guizhou]]) is a female [[badminton]] player from [[Germany]].  She was born in [[Guiyang]], [[Guizhou]], [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China]]. She decided to play for Germany because the Chinese thought that she was too short to play [[professional]] world badminton.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bbc&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Said by [[David Mercer (broadcaster)|David Mercer]]/[[Gillian Clark (badminton)|Gillian Clark]] on August 13, 2008 in match against [[Xie Xingfang]] in the Quarter Finals of the Women&amp;apos;s Singles shown on the [[BBC]].&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; She can speak fluent Chinese, German and English.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bbc&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

==Career==
Xu was among the most successful of a number of Chinese-born female players who emigrated from their badminton-rich homeland, in part, for a better opportunity to play in the world&amp;apos;s biggest events. Beginning in 2003 when she won a spate of middle tier open tournaments in Europe, Xu went on to become one of the more consistent performers on the international circuit. She was a women&amp;apos;s singles bronze medalist twice at the [[BWF World Championships]] ([[2005 IBF World Championships|2005]] and [[2006 IBF World Championships|2006]]) and won [[European Badminton Championships|European Championships]] in [[2006 European Badminton Championships|2006]] and [[2008 European Badminton Championships|2008]] over [[Mia Audina]] and [[Tine Rasmussen]] respectively in the finals.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tournamentsoftware.com/sport/winners.aspx?id=10066 |title=2006 European Championships winners |publisher=tournamentsoftware.com}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tournamentsoftware.com/sport/winners.aspx?id=20426 |title=2008 European Championships winners |publisher=tournamentsoftware.com |accessdate=2008-04-21}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; At the [[Badminton at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]] Xu was eliminated in a close quarterfinal match by China&amp;apos;s [[Xie Xingfang]], the world&amp;apos;s number one ranked player.

Among Xu&amp;apos;s more than twenty national and international singles titles are the [[Scottish Open (badminton)|Scottish]] (2003), [[Polish Open (badminton)|Polish]] (2003), [[Dutch Open (badminton)|Dutch]] (2005), and [[Swiss Open (badminton)|Swiss]] (2006) Opens, the [[Copenhagen Masters]] (2007), and five consecutive (2004&amp;amp;ndash;2008) [[German National Badminton Championships|German National Championships]]. Notably, she earned all of these titles after turning 27, an age at which world level singles players often feel that their best years are behind them.

Xu retired from playing on the international circuit in 2009 and worked as a coach at [[The Bellevue Badminton Club]] near [[Seattle]], teaching the Junior National team of young badminton players hoping to succeed in professional badminton for two years. In 2011, she was appointed as a National Coach of the Dutch Badminton Association.
