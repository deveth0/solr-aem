{{Chinese name|[[Xu (surname)|Xu]]}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xu Kuangdi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;lt;small&amp;gt;[[Order of the Polar Star|KmstkNO]]&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt; ({{zh|c=徐匡迪|p=Xú Kuāngdí}}; born December 1937 in [[Tongxiang]], [[Zhejiang]], [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China|China]]) is a [[Politics of the People&amp;apos;s Republic of China|Chinese politician]] in the ruling [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]. He was [[mayor of Shanghai]] from 1995 to 2001. He supervised the transformation of [[Shanghai]] during his administration into a center for [[Foreign direct investment|international investment]] and trade that helped lead the intensive development of [[Economy of the People&amp;apos;s Republic of China|China&amp;apos;s economy]]. He was demoted in 2001, to a far more obscure and powerless position as party chief of the Academy of Engineering in [[Beijing]], apparently as the result of an internal party power struggle between President [[Jiang Zemin]] and Premier [[Zhu Rongji]], both former Mayors of Shanghai. Xu was replaced by Executive Vice-Mayor [[Chen Liangyu]], one of Jiang&amp;apos;s followers later arrested for corruption. Until 2008 he continued as Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the [[Chinese People&amp;apos;s Political Consultative Conference]].

==Biography==
Xu graduated from the famous [[Hangzhou High School]]. He graduated from the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Engineering in 1959, during the midst of the [[Great Leap Forward]], and was a professor there from 1959 to 1963, then at the Shanghai Institute of Engineering from 1963 to 1971, through the height of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. He did not join the [[Communist Party of China]] until 1983. He studied in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1982 and 1983 and worked in [[Sweden]] from 1984 to 1985; he also won a national award for his design of a [[stainless steel]] pipe for use in aircraft production.

He held a number of other academic positions through 1991, when Zhu appointed him as director of the Shanghai Municipal Planning Committee, allegedly because he had remarked that he hated central planning. That position led to a number of increasingly powerful positions within the municipal government of Shanghai. He was an alternate member of the 14th CPC Central Committee and member of the 15th and 16th CPC Central Committees.

From 2003 to 2008 Xu was a Vice-Chairman of the [[Chinese People&amp;apos;s Political Consultative Conference]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.cctv.com/english/20080229/101322.shtml CPPCC holds meeting to discuss preparations for upcoming session] Xinhua, February 29, 2008&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He is a professor and doctoral supervisor at [[Shanghai University]].

He retired on June 11, 2010 from his post as the Party Chief and President of the [[Chinese Academy of Engineering]].

==Honours==
In 2004 Xu was elected as an International Fellow of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Academy of Engineering]].

In 2006 Xu was made a Commander Grand Cross of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Order of the Polar Star]].

At an October 4, 2007 ceremony, Xu received an [[Honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Engineering]] [[Academic degree|degree]] from the [[Polytechnic University of New York]].
