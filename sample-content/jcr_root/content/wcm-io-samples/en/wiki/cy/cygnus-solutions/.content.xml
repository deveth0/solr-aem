&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cygnus Solutions&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, originally &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cygnus Support&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was founded in 1989 by [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], [[Michael Tiemann]] and David Henkel-Wallace to provide commercial support for [[free software]].  Its tagline was: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Making free software affordable&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

For years, employees of Cygnus Solutions were the maintainers of several key [[GNU]] software products, including the [[GNU Debugger]] and [[GNU Binutils]] (which included the [[GNU Assembler]] and [[GNU Linker|Linker]]).  It was also a major contributor to the [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] project and drove the change in the project&amp;apos;s management from having a single gatekeeper to having an independent committee.  Cygnus developed [[Binary File Descriptor library|BFD]], and used it to help port GNU to many architectures, in a number of cases working under [[Non-disclosure agreement|non-disclosure]] to produce tools used for initial bringup of [[software]] for a new chip design.

Cygnus was also the original developer of [[Cygwin]], a [[POSIX]] layer and the [[GNU]] toolkit port to the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]] family, and of [[eCos]], an embedded [[real-time operating system]].

In the 2001 documentary film &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Revolution OS]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Tiemann indicates that the name &amp;quot;Cygnus&amp;quot; was chosen from among several names that incorporated the acronym &amp;quot;GNU&amp;quot;.

On November 15, 1999, Cygnus Solutions announced its merger with [[Red Hat]], and ceased to exist as a separate company in early 2000. {{As of|2007}}, a number of Cygnus employees continue to work for Red Hat, including Tiemann, who serves as Red Hat&amp;apos;s Vice President of Open Source Affairs, and formerly served as CTO.  Red Hat did not retain the trademark to Cygnus Solutions, nor the cygnus.com domain.
