&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jean Charles Cazin&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (May 25, 1840 &amp;amp;ndash; March 17, 1901) was a [[France|French]] [[Landscape art|landscape painter]] and ceramicist.

The son of a well-known doctor, FJ Cazin (1788–1864), he was born at Samer, [[Pas-de-Calais]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.renoirinc.com/biography/artists/cazin.htm Renoir Fine Art biography]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; After studying in France, he went to England, where he was strongly influenced by the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|pre-Raphaelite movement]]. His chief earlier pictures have a religious interest, shown in such examples as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Flight into Egypt&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1877), or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hagar and Ishmael&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1880, Luxembourg); and afterwards his combination of luminous landscape with figure-subjects (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Souvenir de fête&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1881; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Journée faite&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 1888) gave him a wide repute, and made him the leader of a new school of idealistic subject-painting in France.

In 1890, Theodore Child discussed a few of his paintings (including a series of five paintings depicting the story of [[Judith and Holofernes]]) in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Harper&amp;apos;s Magazine]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news

He was made an officer of the [[Legion d&amp;apos;Honneur|Legion of Honour]] in 1889. His charming and poetical treatment of landscape is the feature in his [[tonalism]] painting which in later years has given them an increasing value among connoisseurs. His wife, [[Marie Cazin]] (1844–1924), who was his pupil and exhibited her first picture at the Salon in 1876, the same year in which Cazin himself made his debut there, was also a well-known artist and sculptor.
