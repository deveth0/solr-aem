&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jean-Baptiste Isabey&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (11 April 1767 – 18 April 1855) was a French [[Painting|painter]] born at [[Nancy, France|Nancy]].

==Life==
At the age of nineteen, after some lessons from [[François Dumont|Dumont]], miniature painter to [[Marie Antoinette]], he became a pupil of [[Jacques-Louis David]]. Employed at [[Versailles]] on portraits of the dukes of Angoulême and Berry, he was given a commission by the queen, which opens the long list of those he received from successive French rulers until his death in 1855.

Patronized by [[Josephine de Beauharnais|Josephine]] and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], he arranged the ceremonies of their coronation and prepared drawings for the publication intended as its official commemoration, a work for which he was paid by [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], whose portrait (engraved by [[Louis-Philibert Debucourt|Debucourt]]) he executed in 1814. Although Isabey did homage to Napoleon on his return from [[Elba]], he continued to enjoy the favour of the Restoration, and took part in arrangements for the coronation of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]].&amp;lt;ref name=eb1911/&amp;gt;

The monarchy of July conferred on him an important post in connection with the royal collections, and [[Napoleon III]] granted him a pension, and the cross of commander of the [[Legion of Honor]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Review of Troops by the First Consul&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was one of his most important compositions, and Isabey&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boat&amp;apos;&amp;apos; – a charming drawing of himself and family-produced at a time when he was much occupied with lithography – had an immense success at the Salon of 1820 (engraved, [[Charles Paul Landon|Landon]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Annales&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, i. 125). His portrait of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Napoleon at Malmaison&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is held to be the best ever executed, and even his tiny head of the king of Rome, painted for a breast-pin, is distinguished by a decision and breadth that show the hand of a master.&amp;lt;ref name=eb1911/&amp;gt;

A biography of Isabey was published by [[E. Taigny]] in 1859, and [[Charles Lenormant|Charles Lenormant&amp;apos;s]] article, written for [[Joseph François Michaud|Michaud]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Biog. Univ.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is founded on facts furnished by Isabey&amp;apos;s family.&amp;lt;ref name=eb1911&amp;gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1911&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
