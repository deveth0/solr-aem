&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jean Antoine Letronne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (25 January 1787 &amp;amp;ndash; 14 December 1848) was a French [[archaeologist]].

Born in Paris, his father, a poor engraver, sent him to study art under the painter David, but his own tastes were literary, and he became a student in the [[Collège de France]], where it is said he used to exercise his already strongly developed critical faculty by correcting old translations of [[Greek literature|Greek]] authors and afterwards comparing the results with the latest and most approved editions.

== Overview ==

From 1810 to 1812 he travelled in France, Switzerland and Italy, and on his return to Paris published a paper entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Essai critique sur la topographie de Syracuse&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, designed to elucidate [[Thucydides]].  Two years later appeared his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Recherches geographiques et critiques on the De Mensura Orbis Terrae of Dicuil&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  In 1815 he was commissioned by government to complete the translation of [[Strabo]] &amp;lt;!-- ?? --&amp;gt; which had been begun by [[François-Jean-Gabriel de La Porte du Theil]], and in March 1816 he was one of those who were admitted to the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres|Academy of Inscriptions]] by royal ordinance, having previously contributed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;On the Metrical System of the Egyptians&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Further promotion came rapidly: in 1817 he was appointed director of the [[École Nationale des Chartes]], in 1829 inspector-general of the university, and in 1831 professor of history in the [[Collège de France]].  This chair he exchanged in 1838 for that of archaeology, and in 1840 he succeeded [[Pierre Claude François Daunou]] as keeper of the national archives.

Meanwhile he had published, among other works, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Considérations générales sur l&amp;apos;évaluation des monnaies grecques et romaines, et sur la valeur de l&amp;apos;or et de l&amp;apos;argent avant la découverte de l&amp;apos;Amérique&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1817, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Recherches pour servir à l&amp;apos;histoire de l&amp;apos;Egypte pendant la domination des Grecs et des Romains&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1823, and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sur l&amp;apos;origine grecque des zodiaques pretendus egyptiens&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1837.  By the lastnamed he finally exploded a fallacy which had up to that time vitiated the chronology of contemporary Egyptologists. His &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Diplômes et chartes de l&amp;apos;époque mérovingienne, sur papyrus et sur vélin&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were published in 1844.  The most important work of Letronne is the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Recueil des inscriptions grecques et latines de l&amp;apos;Égypte&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of which the first volume appeared in 1842, and the second in 1848.
