&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jean-Pierre Barda&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 7 March 1967, [[Paris]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] singer, actor, make up artist and hair dresser of [[Algeria]]n descent. He is most notable for being one of the founding members of the pop group [[Army of Lovers]].

== Early life ==
Barda was born in [[Paris]], [[France]], and moved to [[Sweden]] with his [[Algeria]]n [[Jew]]ish family as a child. Barda started out working with [[Alexander Bard]] as a part of the music group &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Barbie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. He initially called himself Farouk, but reverted to his real name when &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Barbie&amp;apos;&amp;apos; later evolved into the group &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Army of Lovers&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Barda has been with the group throughout all of its incarnations.

== Career ==
In 2004, there was initially a suggestion that Barda would be part of a new band called [[Bodies Without Organs]]. This did not come to fruition, and Barda&amp;apos;s explicit involvement extended only as far as co-writing BWO&amp;apos;s first single &amp;quot;Living In A Fantasy&amp;quot;.

Besides his work in music, Jean-Pierre is also very well known in Sweden as a hair-dresser and make-up artist. Additionally, Barda has done work in various fields of digital photography and entertainment starring as an actor in movies, television, multiple photo shoots, and worked in the presence of her majesty, the Queen of Sweden, while assisting mentor and teacher, Mr. Björn Axén. Barda currently works with a 3G phone company on developing a TV-style fashion programme for mobile phones.
