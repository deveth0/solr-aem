        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jean de Gisors&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1133–1220) was a [[Normans|Norman]] lord of the fortress of [[Gisors]] in [[Normandy]], where meetings were traditionally convened between [[England|English]] and [[France|French]] kings. It was here, in 1188, a squabble occurred that involved the [[Cutting of the elm|cutting of an elm]].

Initially he was a vassal of the king of England - [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and then [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. During this time he also owned property in [[Sussex]] and the manor of Titchfield in [[Hampshire]] in England.

Sometime between 1170 and 1180 he purchased the manor of [[Buckland, Portsmouth|Buckland]], Hampshire from the de Port family. On this newly purchased land he founded the town of [[Portsmouth]] as one end of a trade route between England and France. The original settlement of Portsmouth was a planned town on a medieval grid pattern, of which other examples can be found in places like [[Salisbury]]. Much of this original grid pattern is still visible in the [[Old Portsmouth]] district of Portsmouth.

One of the first acts ordered by de Gisors in Portsmouth was the donation of land to the Augustinian canons of [[Southwick Priory]] so that they could build a chapel &amp;quot;to the glorious honour of the martyr Thomas of Canterbury, one time Archbishop, on (my) land which is called Sudewede, the island of Portsea&amp;quot;, [[Thomas Becket]] having spent much time in Gisors. This foundation of the Church of St Thomas of Canterbury was to eventually become [[Portsmouth Cathedral]].

However the royal patronage of de Gisors was not to last, as after his support for an unsuccessful rebellion in Normandy in 1193 he paid the price by forfeiting all his lands, including Portsmouth, to [[Richard I]].

==In popular culture==
In [[conspiracy theories]], such as the one promoted in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Jean de Gisors has been alleged to be the first [[Priory of Sion#Alleged Grand Masters|Grand Master of the Priory of Sion]] (1188–1220).
