==Biography==
Magee, who was born in Chicago, was raised in Nebraska. He graduated in 1950 from the [[University of Nebraska at Omaha|University of Nebraska]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/nfl/magee/index.html &amp;apos;&amp;apos;San Diego Union-Tribune&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, About Jerry Magee]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He served in the Army in Korea.

==Career==
His first job newspaper job was as a copyboy at the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Omaha World-Herald]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, where one of his tasks was to mix flower and water into the paste used by copy readers. He joined the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;San Diego Union-Tribune&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1956.

Magee was called &amp;quot;an [[American Football League]] apologist&amp;quot; by his contemporaries who covered NFL football, adopting it himself and regularly quoting it.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2011/oct/08/iconic-raiders-owner-helped-mold-nfl/ &amp;apos;&amp;apos;San Diego Union-Tribune&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;Iconic Raiders owner helped mold NFL,&amp;quot; October 8, 2011]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He took on what he has called the &amp;quot;NFL apologists,&amp;quot; including William Wallace, sports columnist with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The New York Times]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and [[Jerry Green (writer)|Jerry Green]] of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Detroit Free Press]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in Magee&amp;apos;s attempt to puncture what he called &amp;quot;NFL myths.&amp;quot;

Magee brought attention to the AFL&amp;apos;s style of football, including writing about [[Will McDonough]] and his service on the American Football League [[Hall of Fame]] board of selectors.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.conigliofamily.com/AFLcontributors.htm#MageeText | title=American Football League Contributors | accessdate=2007-08-05 | work=Unofficial &amp;quot;American Football League Hall of Fame&amp;quot; at the Coniglio family website}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Upon Magee&amp;apos;s retirement in September 2008, the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Union-Tribune&amp;apos;&amp;apos; published a tribute article about Magee that was written by people he covered and worked with, including former [[San Diego Chargers]] running back [[Hank Bauer]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20080927/news_7s27mageefix.html &amp;quot;About Jerry Magee: Stories about the Union-Tribune&amp;apos;s longtime sportswriter,&amp;quot; September 27, 2008]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Recognition==
October 29, 2008 was proclaimed &amp;quot;Jerry Magee Day&amp;quot; by the [[San Diego City Council]] in recognition of his more than 50 years as &amp;quot;one of
the region&amp;apos;s top sports writers.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://docs.sandiego.gov/councildockets_attach/2008/November/11-18-2008_Item_147.pdf San Diego City Council docket, &amp;quot;October 29, 2008 to be &amp;apos;Jerry Magee Day&amp;apos; in San Diego,&amp;quot; October 27, 2008]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
