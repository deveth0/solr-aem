==Personal life==
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jennette Bradley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born October 2, 1952), her family would settle in a neighborhood on Columbus&amp;apos; east side, after her father retired from the [[United States Army]]. Bradley graduated from [[East High School (Columbus, Ohio)|East High School]] in 1970. Upon graduation, Bradley attended [[Wittenberg University]] in [[Springfield, Ohio]], and would earn a degree in psychology.
Bradley would take a job with the Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority, which she would later be promoted to head of the authority when she was twenty-eight years old.
In 1986, Bradley moved to Washington, D.C. Bradley would move back to Columbus in 1989 and work for [[Huntington National Bank]].

==Columbus City Council==
Bradley entered the 1991 City Council race, with her newly wed husband as her campaign manager. Bradley ran as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and won, becoming the first African American woman to serve on the council. She would be reelected in 1995 and 1999. During her tenure she was in charge of the parks and recreation and public utilities commissions.

==Lieutenant governor==
In 2002 [[Bob Taft|Governor Taft]] announced he had chosen Bradley to replace [[Maureen O&amp;apos;Connor]] as his running mate.
Many conservatives did not support Bradley because she was [[pro-choice]]. Critics of the Taft-Bradley ticket were also concerned about her City Council vote to extend city worker&amp;apos;s health care benefits to include [[Domestic Partnership|domestic partners]] and [[same-sex couples]]. Bradley was then criticized for having later voted against this extension.

Taft and Bradley won the race with approximately 58% of the vote. Bradley became the third female [[Lieutenant Governor of Ohio|Lieutenant Governor]] in Ohio and the first African American woman elected to the office.

After taking office, Bradley was appointed by Taft to head the [[Ohio Department of Commerce]], the [[Clean Ohio Council]], and the Ohio Housing Finance Agency. In 2004, the governor also appointed Bradley to the &amp;quot;Jobs Cabinet.&amp;quot;  Following the resignation of [[Joseph T. Deters]] as state treasurer, Taft appointed Bradley to the post, effective January 2005.  However, Bradley was defeated by conservative [[Ashtabula County]] Auditor [[Sandra O&amp;apos;Brien]] in the May 2006 Republican primary election.

[[Jet (magazine)|Jet Magazine]] reported that Bradley&amp;apos;s inauguration was &amp;quot;awe-inspiring.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/jennette-bradley&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
