        text="&lt;p&gt;:  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jerry&amp;apos;s Kids&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also refers to children supported by the disease advocacy group [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]].&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jerry&amp;apos;s Kids&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of the earliest [[Boston hardcore]] bands, formed in 1981, from Braintree, Mass.. Their first recorded output was on the [[Modern Method Records|Modern Method]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[This Is Boston, Not L.A.]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; compilation LP in 1982. They contributed six tracks along with other early Boston Hardcore band [[Gang Green]]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jerry&amp;apos;s Kids&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is also one of the earliest &amp;apos;Grateful Dead&amp;apos; bands - based in the San Francisco Bay Area which was created originally in late 1981 as a side band of the group &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dead Air&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. In that form of Dead Air, Jerry&amp;apos;s Kids played the music played by individual side bands formed by Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir.[[Jerry&amp;apos;s Kids|- Jerry&amp;apos;s Kids of the Bay Area(band)]]. At the time the west coasters version of Jerry&amp;apos;s Kids did not know of the east coast Jerry&amp;apos;s Kids. When the band name being used by the Boston hardcore band was finally known, neither band did anything to resolve the name &amp;apos;issue&amp;apos;. It never became important both bands wished to make it easier for folks who could not figure it out on their own. It is only ironic that the band playing the most influential SF bands known for its Haight-Ashby flower power associations would have to make it clear that &amp;quot;no, they had not recorded &amp;apos;Kill,Kill,Kill&amp;apos; featuring a graphic of a kid wielding a bloodied hatchet!!!&amp;quot;.

Frontman Bryan Jones and rhythm guitar player Dave Aronson left the band early on. Bryan Jones had broken his leg at one of their gigs and his parents denied him permission to play in the band any further. Bassist Rick Jones (Bryan&amp;apos;s brother) switched to vocals and [[Chris Doherty]] of [[Gang Green]] took over on rhythm guitar. It was this line-up that recorded the classic 12 song [[vinyl record|LP]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Is This My World?]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on [[X-Claim Records|X-Claim]] in 1983, featuring songs such as &amp;quot;Cracks In The Wall&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Build Me A Bomb&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Vietnam Syndrome&amp;quot;. They broke up in 1985, but reformed in 1987 with a more speed metal sound and released an LP on [[Taang! Records]] entitled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kill Kill Kill&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. [[Reflex/Wolfpack Records]] released a limited re-issue of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Is This My World?]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; LP in 2002.  The band reunited again in 2004 and has been playing several shows per year around Boston since then. Their current recording plans, if any, are unknown.
