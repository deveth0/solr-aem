==Biography==
Rabaut de Saint-Étienne was born at [[Nîmes]], countytown of [[Gard]], the son of [[Paul Rabaut]], the additional surname of Saint-Étienne taken from a small property near Nîmes.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://lwww.studylight.org/enc/bri/view.cgi?n=16953 Jean Paul Rabaut Saint-Etienne], 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Like his father, he became a Calvinist pastor, and distinguished himself with his zeal for his co-religionists, becoming a spokesman for the Protestant community in France.  He worked closely with [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Guillaume-Chrétien de Malesherbes]], minister to [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and with members of the [[parlement]] of the [[Ancien Régime]] to obtain formal recognition of Protestant [[civil rights]].  This was despite the concerns of some Royal advisors.

Officially ending religious persecution in France, Louis XVI signed the [[Edict of Tolerance]] on 7 November 1787, and it was registered in [[parlement]] two-and-one-half months later (29 January 1788). This edict offered relief to all the major non-[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faiths of the time – [[Calvinist]] [[Huguenots]], [[Lutherans]], and [[Jews]]. After more than a century of prohibition, it gave them all civil and legal recognition as well as the right to openly form new congregations.

Full religious freedom had to wait two more years until the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789]], but the 1787 Edict of Tolerance was a pivotal step in subduing religious strife and it officially ended religious persecution in France.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_%281787%29.html Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Ideals, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Edict of Versailles (1787)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;], downloaded 29 January 2012&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Having gained a reputation with his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Histoire primitive de la Grèce&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, he was elected deputy to the [[Estates-General of 1789]] by the third estate of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[bailliage]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of Nîmes.

In the [[Constituent Assembly]], Rabaut de Saint-Étienne worked on the framing of the constitution; he spoke against the establishment of the Republic, which he considered ridiculous; and voted for the suspensive veto, as likely to strengthen the position of the Crown. In the Convention, he sat among the [[Girondists]], opposed the [[trial of Louis XVI]], was a member of the [[Commission of Twelve]], and was proscribed with his party.

He remained in hiding for some time, but he was ultimately discovered and [[guillotined]] in December 1793.
