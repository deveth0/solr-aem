{{distinguish|Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d&amp;apos;Erlon}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jean-Baptiste Drouet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (January 8, 1763 – April 11, 1824) was a [[French People|French]] politician of the [[French Revolution|1789 Revolution]], chiefly noted for the part he played in the arrest of [[King of France|King]] [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] during the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Flight to Varennes]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Early life, Varennes, and in the Convention==
Born at [[Sainte-Menehould]], [[Marne]], he served for seven years in the army, and afterwards helped his father in his duties as [[postmaster]] of Sainte-Menehould. The carriages conveying the royal family on their flight to the frontier stopped at his door on the evening of June 21, 1791; and the passengers, travelling under assumed names, were recognized by Drouet, who immediately took steps which led to their arrest and detention on reaching [[Varennes]].

For this service the [[The Legislative Assembly and the fall of the French monarchy|Legislative Assembly]] awarded him 30,000 [[French franc|francs]], but he appears to have declined the reward. In September 1792 he was elected deputy to the [[National Convention]], and took his place with the most violent group.

He voted for the death of the king without [[appeal]], showed virulent hostility to the [[Girondin]]s, and proposed the slaughter of all [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] residents in France after the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the formation of the [[First Coalition|First Coalition against France]]. Sent as [[commissioner]] to the [[French Revolutionary Army|Army of the North]], he was captured at the siege of [[Maubeuge]] and imprisoned at [[Castle of Spielberg|Spielberg]] until the close of the conflict in 1795.

==Directory and beyond==
He then became a member of the [[French Directory|Directory]]&amp;apos;s [[Council of Five Hundred]], and was named secretary. Drouet was implicated in the [[François-Noël Babeuf|conspiracy of Babeuf]], and was imprisoned, but made his escape into [[Switzerland]], and went from there to [[Tenerife]], where he took part in the successful resistance to [[Horatio Nelson]]&amp;apos;s attack on the island, in 1797; he later visited [[India]]. He returned to France without being prosecuted, and took his seat in the Council with the [[Jacobin (politics)|Neo-Jacobins]] (who were trying to revive the [[Jacobin Club]]).

By the [[First French Empire|First Empire]], he had become a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Préfet|sub-préfet]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of Sainte-Menehould. After the [[Second Restoration]] in 1815, he was compelled to leave France after being deemed &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[regicide]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;, but, returning secretly, he settled at [[Mâcon]], under the name of Merger, and kept his identity hidden until his death.
