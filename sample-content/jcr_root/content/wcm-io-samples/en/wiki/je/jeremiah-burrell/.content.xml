&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jeremiah Murry Burrell&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born September 1, 1815 in [[Murrysville, Pennsylvania]]) was a lawyer and judge in western [[Pennsylvania]], of whom three areas were named for.

In 1835, he started his career as a lawyer in the [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]] seat of [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania|Greensburg]], and around 1839 bought the rights to the newspaper,
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pennsylvania Argus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which he used to promote his political views as editor. He was receiving national attention for his fiery debates by the early 1840s.

By 1844, he was debating for Presidential candidate [[James K. Polk]]. He further continued his political career as judge of the Tenth Judicial District of Pennsylvania in 1847 which he held until 1855 when he was appointed judge of the Territorial District of [[Kansas]] by President [[Franklin Pierce]].

Burrell suffered from [[malaria]], and returned to Greensburg in 1856. He later died of the sickness on October 1, 1856, aged 41.

Today, townships in [[Indiana County, Pennsylvania|Indiana County]] ([[Burrell Township, Indiana County, Pennsylvania|Burrell]]), [[Armstrong County, Pennsylvania|Armstrong County]] ([[Burrell Township, Armstrong County, Pennsylvania|Burrell]]), and [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]] ([[Lower Burrell, Pennsylvania|Lower Burrell]] and [[Upper Burrell]]) bear his namesake.
