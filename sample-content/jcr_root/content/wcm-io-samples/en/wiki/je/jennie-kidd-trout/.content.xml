&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jennie Kidd Trout&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (April 21, 1841 - November 10, 1921) was the first woman in Canada legally to become a medical doctor, and was the only woman in Canada licensed to practice medicine until 1880, when [[Emily Stowe]] completed the official qualifications.

Born &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jennie Kidd McGowan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in [[Wooden Mills]], [[Kelso, Scotland|Kelso]], [[Scotland]], Jennie (whose name is variously spelled &amp;apos;Jenny&amp;apos;) moved with her parents to Canada in 1847, settling near [[Stratford, Ontario]]. Trout had taken a course in teaching after graduation, and had taught until her marriage to Edward Trout.  She married Trout in 1865 and thereafter moved to [[Toronto]], where Edward ran a newspaper.

Motivated by her own chronic illnesses, she decided on a medical career, passing her matriculation exam in 1871 and studying medicine at the [[University of Toronto]]. Trout and Emily Jennings Stowe were together the first women admitted to the Toronto School of Medicine, by special arrangement. Stowe, however, refused to sit her exams in protest of the school&amp;apos;s demeaning treatment of the two women. Trout later transferred to the [[Women&amp;apos;s Medical College]] in [[Pennsylvania]], where she earned her M.D. on March 11, 1875 and become the first licensed female physician in Canada.

Trout then opened the Therapeutic and Electrical Institute in Toronto, which specialized in treatments for women involving &amp;quot;[[galvanic bath]]s or electricity.&amp;quot;  For six years, she also ran a free dispensary for the poor at the same location.  The Institute was quite successful, later opening branches in [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], Ontario.

Due to poor health, Trout retired in 1882 to [[Palma Sola, Florida|Palma Sola]], [[Florida]].  She was later instrumental in the establishment of a medical school for women at [[Queen&amp;apos;s University at Kingston|Queen&amp;apos;s University]] in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]].  Her family traveled extensively between Florida and Ontario, and later moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], where she died in 1921.
