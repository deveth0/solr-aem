&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jesus Justus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Greek &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Iesous ho legomenos Ioustos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was one of several Jewish Christians in the church at Rome mentioned by [[Twelve Apostles|Apostle]] [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] in the greetings at the end of [[Colossians]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Col%204:11;&amp;amp;version=31; 4:11].
{{quotation|Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you have received instructions--if he comes to you, welcome him), and Jesus who is called Justus. These are the only men of the circumcision among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.. Colossians 4:10-11}}
It is generally thought that Paul wrote [[Colossians]] while in prison in Rome most likely during AD 50’s. Of those with Paul, Justus, Aristarchus, and [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] are said in the letter to be “of the circumcision”, that is, Jewish and to have &amp;quot;proved a comfort to me.&amp;quot;

The name &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jesus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was not uncommon at the time of [[Jesus of Nazareth]], as it was a form of the [[Old Testament]] name [[Joshua]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Yeshua]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ישוע).
