&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;John Jean Goldkette&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (18 March 1893&amp;amp;ndash;March 24, 1962) was a [[jazz]] [[pianist]] and [[bandleader]] born in [[France]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Ted Gioia]]: The History of Jazz, Oxford University Press 2011, p. 83&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Goldkette spent his childhood in [[Greece]] and [[Russia]], and emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1911.

He led many jazz and dance bands, of which the best known was his [[Victor Recording Orchestra]] of 1924â€“1929, which included, at various times, [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Hoagy Carmichael]], [[Chauncey Morehouse]], [[Jimmy Dorsey]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Bill Rank]], [[Eddie Lang]], [[Frankie Trumbauer]], [[Pee Wee Russell]], [[Steve Brown (bass player)|Steve Brown]], [[Joe Venuti]], and arranger [[Robert Ginzler]] among others. Vocalists included the [[Keller Sisters and Lynch]]. In his &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jazz Masters of the Thirties&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Rex Stewart]], a member of [[Fletcher Henderson]]&amp;apos;s band at the time, writes that the Goldkette band&amp;apos;s innovative arrangements and strong rhythm made it the best dance band of its day and &amp;quot;the first original white swing band in jazz history&amp;quot;.

Jean Goldkette was also the Music Director for the Detroit Athletic Club for over 20 years, and co-owned the legendary Graystone Ballroom with Charles Horvath, who also performed with the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Goldkette Victor Band&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in its early years. He owned his own entertainment company, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jean Goldkette&amp;apos;s Orchestras and Attractions&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, working out of the still-standing Book-Cadillac Hotel in Detroit. He co-wrote the song &amp;quot;It&amp;apos;s the Blues (No. 14 Blues)&amp;quot; which was recorded in Detroit, Michigan and released on Victor.

In 1927, [[Paul Whiteman]], the controversially self-proclaimed &amp;quot;King of Jazz,&amp;quot; hired away most of Goldkette&amp;apos;s better players&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.redhotjazz.com/goldkette.html Goldkette on The Red Hot Jazz Archive] Retrieved 19 June 2013.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; due to Goldkette not being able to meet the payroll for his top-notch musicians. Goldkette later helped organize [[McKinney&amp;apos;s Cotton Pickers]] and [[Glen Gray]]&amp;apos;s Orange Blossoms, which became famous as the [[Casa Loma Orchestra]]. In the 1930s he left jazz to work as a booking agent and classical pianist. In the mid-1930s, Jean filed for bankruptcy, showing over $200,000 in debts, and only $.40 in assets.

In 1939, he organized the [[American Symphony Orchestra]] which debuted at [[Carnegie Hall]]. He married Lee McQuillen, a native of New York City. [[Frankie Laine]] worked as Goldkette&amp;apos;s librarian, and lived with the Goldkettes while in New York. {{citation needed|date=February 2010}}

He moved to [[California]] in 1961, and the following year died in [[Santa Barbara, California]], of a heart attack, aged 69. He took a taxi to the hospital by himself, and died that same day.  He is buried in the Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery in [[Los Angeles, California]].
