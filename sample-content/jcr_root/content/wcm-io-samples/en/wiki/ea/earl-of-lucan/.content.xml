&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earl of Lucan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a title in the [[Peerage of Ireland]] which has been possessed by two related Irish families in creations of 1691 and 1795.  The current holder is presumed to be [[Richard Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan]], who vanished in 1974.

The subsidiary titles associated with the Earldom are: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Lucan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of [[Castlebar]] in the [[County Mayo|County of Mayo]] (created 1776), and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Bingham&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Melcombe Bingham in the County of Dorset (1934). The first is in the [[Peerage of Ireland]], the second in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]], and therefore allowed Earls of Lucan to sit in the [[House of Lords]] after the practice of electing [[representative peers]] from Ireland ceased. The Earl of Lucan also has a Baronetcy (of Castlebar, Co Mayo) created in the [[Baronetage of Nova Scotia]] 7 June 1634.

In 1691, [[Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan|Patrick Sarsfield]], who had been one of King [[James II of England|James II]]&amp;apos;s senior Irish commanders during his battles in Ireland with [[William III of England|William of Orange]] for the English, Scottish and Irish thrones (see [[Glorious Revolution]]), was given the title of Earl of [[Lucan, County Dublin|Lucan]]. Sarsfield&amp;apos;s son James Sarsfield died without an heir in 1719 and the title became extinct.

Patrick Sarsfield&amp;apos;s great-nephew, Charles Bingham, had the title re-created in 1795.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://clanbyrne.com/genealogy/the-obyrne-omoore-windsor-pedigree/ Lineage online linking William Sarsfield of Lucan to Charles Bingham]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://humphrysfamilytree.com/Sidney/sarsfield.html&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Since this was a re-created title, despite the family connection, Charles Bingham was (as usual) called the 1st Earl of Lucan of the &amp;quot;second creation&amp;quot;.

The title became notorious when [[George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan]], as cavalry commander in the [[Crimean War]], was one of the men involved in the ill-fated [[Charge of the Light Brigade]].

Its notoriety was renewed after the disappearance in 1974 of the [[Richard Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan|7th Earl]]. In June 1975, in his absence, a [[coroner]]&amp;apos;s jury found that he had murdered his children&amp;apos;s nanny, Sandra Rivett. There have been no confirmed sightings of Lord Lucan since his disappearance, and he was declared [[Death in absentia|legally dead]] in October 1999. His son and heir, [[George Bingham, Lord Bingham|George Bingham]], now uses the style Earl of Lucan and is the beneficiary of the Lucan Settled Estates. However his petition in 1998 to take his father&amp;apos;s seat in the [[House of Lords]] was refused by the [[Lord Chancellor]].
