[[Image:Compass Rose English East.svg|thumb|250px|right|A 16-point [[compass rose]] with east highlighted &amp;lt;!-- Highlighting of east is nearly imperceptable --&amp;gt;]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;East&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[noun]], [[adjective]], or [[adverb]] indicating [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] or [[geography]].
East is one of the four [[cardinal directions]] or [[compass]] points. It is the opposite of [[west]] and is [[perpendicular]] to [[north]] and [[south]].

By [[Norm (sociology)|convention]], the right hand side of a [[map]] is east.

To go east using a compass for [[navigation]], set a [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] or [[azimuth]] of 90°.

East is the direction toward which the [[Earth]] rotates about its [[Axis of rotation|axis]], and therefore the general direction from which the [[Sun]] appears to rise.

During the [[Cold War]], &amp;quot;The East&amp;quot;  was sometimes used to refer to the [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China|Communist China]], along with other [[Communist]] nations.

Throughout history, the East has also been used by Europeans in reference to the [[Orient]] and [[Asia]]n societies.

==Etymology==
The word &amp;apos;&amp;apos;east&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is derived from the [[Proto-Germanic]] *aus-to- or *austra- &amp;quot;east, toward the sunrise&amp;quot;, from [[Proto-Indo-European language]] *aus- &amp;quot;to shine,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;dawn&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=east&amp;amp;allowed_in_frame=0&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Ēostre]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a [[Germanic gods|Germanic goddess]] of dawn, might have been a personification of both dawn and the cardinal points.
