        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eaton&amp;apos;s Corrasable Bond&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[trademark]]ed name for a brand of erasable [[typewriter|typing]] [[paper]]. Erasable paper has a glazed or coated surface which is almost invisible, is easily removed by friction, and accepts typewriter ink fairly well. Removing the coating removes the ink on top of it, so mistakes can be easily erased once. After erasure, the correction is typed onto an unprotected paper surface and cannot be easily erased a second time.

Because the coated surface does not absorb ink, erasable paper is apt to smudge. Since the coating is intended to be easily removed by friction, the typed pages are not very durable. Under some storage conditions, the coating is apt to make pages stick together. Erasable paper is not suitable for legal documents or archival records.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://listserv.muohio.edu/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind9612a&amp;amp;L=archives&amp;amp;T=0&amp;amp;F=&amp;amp;S=&amp;amp;P=10954 Listserve 14.5]. [[Miami University]]. December 6, 1996. Retrieved September 20, 2012.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was available in a number of thicknesses.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://tech.mit.edu/archives/VOL_080/TECH_V080_S0199_P002.txt &amp;quot;NOT A SIGN OF A SLIP-UP!&amp;quot;]. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Tech&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

Eaton&amp;apos;s Corrasable Bond is no longer manufactured.{{fact|date=September 2012}}

In the United States, Eaton&amp;apos;s Corrasable Bond was a very familiar brand of erasable typing paper during the mid-1950s and 1960s, and &amp;quot;corrasable&amp;quot; became almost a [[genericized trademark|generic name]] for erasable typing paper. For example, in prohibiting the use of such paper for manuscript submissions, the  Linguistic Society of America refers to &amp;quot;Eaton&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;Corrasable Bond&amp;apos; and similar brands.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.umich.edu/~archive/linguistics/LSA.style.sheet &amp;quot;LSA Style Sheet for Publications of the Linguistic Society of America&amp;quot;]. [[University of Michigan]]. 1988. Retrieved September 20, 2012.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Writer [[Peter David]], who worked as an editor&amp;apos;s assistant at the [[E. P. Dutton]] imprint Elsevier/Nelson before becoming a professional writer, once related finding a submission written on erasable bond, which made the print difficult to read.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[David, Peter]].

Originally published in &amp;quot;But I Digress...&amp;quot; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Comics Buyer&amp;apos;s Guide]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; #1260 (January 9, 1998)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In a 1992 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Comics Buyer&amp;apos;s Guide]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; column in which he provided aspiring writers with tips on composing submissions, he stated, &amp;quot;Don&amp;apos;t write on anything other than standard-weight white bond paper. I don&amp;apos;t care what Abe Lincoln or Jack Kerouac wrote on; you&amp;apos;re not Lincoln or Kerouac. And for crying out loud, don&amp;apos;t use erasable bond. That wasn&amp;apos;t a dodge the writer used in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to get Annie out of the house; no real writer types on erasable bond.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;David, Peter. &amp;quot;Breaking In&amp;quot;. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;But I Digress&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. 1994.

==In fiction==
The paper is mentioned in the [[Stephen King]] novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Misery&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, when [[Annie Wilkes]] buys it for Paul Sheldon, thinking that since it is the most expensive paper, it has to be the best. When Paul shows Annie that Corrasable Bond is smudge-prone, and hence detested by editors, Annie thinks he is being ungrateful and smashes his still-healing knee.

&amp;quot;Divorce or Corrasable Bond&amp;quot; is a poem by Daniela Gioseffi.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Gioseffi, Daniela (February 1, 2000). [http://www.pifmagazine.com/2000/02/divorce-or-corrasable-bond/ &amp;quot;Divorce or Corrasable Bond&amp;quot;]. Pif Magazine.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
