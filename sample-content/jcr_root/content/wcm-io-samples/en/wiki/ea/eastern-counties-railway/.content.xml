The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eastern Counties Railway&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (ECR) was an early [[England|English]] [[railway]] company incorporated in 1836. It was intended to link [[London]] with [[Ipswich]] via [[Colchester]], and then on to [[Norwich]] and [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]]. Construction began in late March 1837 on the first nine miles, at the London end of the line.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon, D.PI.|editors=Thomas, David St John and Patmore, J. Allan|title=A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain —  Volume 5: The Eastern Counties|edition=2nd|year=1977|publisher=[[David &amp;amp; Charles]]|location=Newton Abbott}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Construction was beset by engineering and other problems, leading to severe financial difficulties. As a result the scope of the project was truncated in April 1839 to Colchester.

==Opening==
The railway began operating on 20 June 1839 with a train service running from a temporary terminus at {{rws|Devonshire Street}} in [[Mile End]] to [[Romford]], now part of the [[Great Eastern Main Line]]. On 1 July 1840 the line was extended to [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]] and a new London terminus at Shoreditch (renamed [[Bishopsgate railway station|Bishopsgate]] in 1846). The line was subsequently extended, opening on 7 March 1843 to cover the 51 miles between London and [[Colchester]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite book|author=White, H.P.|editors=Thomas, David St John|title=A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain —  Volume 3: Greater London|edition=3rd|year=1987|publisher=[[David &amp;amp; Charles]]|location=Dawlish}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Track gauge==
The ECR tracks were originally set to a [[rail gauge|gauge]] of five feet but between September and October 1844 the gauge was converted to [[standard gauge]] (4′8½″). At the same time the associated [[Northern &amp;amp; Eastern Railway]] was also converted.

==Extensions==
===To Norwich===
ECR trains eventually reached Norwich, but not at first via the Colchester route. Instead it used the route of the originally separate [[Northern &amp;amp; Eastern Railway|Northern &amp;amp; Eastern]] (N&amp;amp;ER) and [[Norwich &amp;amp; Brandon Railway|Norwich &amp;amp; Brandon]] railways, via Stratford, Cambridge, Ely and Brandon. The ECR took the partly completed N&amp;amp;ER on lease on 1 January 1844, the through line to Norwich opening on 30 July 1845.

===To Ipswich===
The Colchester line was extended to [[Ipswich]] in 1846, and to [[Norwich]] in 1849, but via the separate [[Eastern Union Railway]], with which the ECR made an end-on connection. After a period of poor relations, the ECR took over the operation of the EUR on 1 January 1854, a situation formally sanctioned by the Act of 7 August 1854. The merged company in turn, in 1862,  amalgamated along with a number of other [[East Anglia]]n railways to form the [[Great Eastern Railway]].

==Innovations==
The ECR is notable as the first company to utilise a two-wheel [[pony truck]] in 1859, using the design of American inventor [[Levi Bissell]].
