&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earl of Beaconsfield&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Hughenden in the County of Buckingham, was a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created in 1876 for [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]], a favourite of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].  Victoria favoured Disraeli&amp;apos;s [[Tory]] policies over those of his [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] rival, [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. Disraeli had also promoted the [[Royal Titles Act 1876]] that had given Victoria the title of &amp;quot;[[Emperor of India|Empress of India]]&amp;quot;. The subsidiary title of the earldom was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscount Hughenden&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Hughenden in the County of Buckingham, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

In 1868, at the end of his first term as Prime Minister, Disraeli&amp;apos;s wife [[Mary Disraeli, 1st Viscountess Beaconsfield|Mary]] had been created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscountess Beaconsfield&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Beaconsfield in the County of Buckingham, in her own right, allowing her husband to remain a member of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].  Lady Beaconsfield died in 1872.  When Disraeli became an earl in 1876 he automatically lost his seat in the Commons but remained Prime Minister, leading his government from the [[House of Lords]].

[[Beaconsfield]] is the name of a town in the county of [[Buckinghamshire]].  For most of his parliamentary career, Disraeli served as a [[Buckinghamshire (UK Parliament constituency)|member for Buckinghamshire]].  He owned an estate, [[Hughenden Manor]], in the nearby town of [[High Wycombe]], but never lived in Beaconsfield.  His choice of title might have been partly influenced by the fact that in 1794 the conservative political philosopher and parliamentarian [[Edmund Burke]], whom Disraeli admired, had turned down King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]&amp;apos;s offer to raise him to the peerage as Lord Beaconsfield.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; See, e.g., Isa Carrington Cabell, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13220/13220-h/13220-h.htm#BEACONSFIELD &amp;quot;Lord Beaconsfield (1804-1881)&amp;quot;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

In 1878, Disraeli refused Queen Victoria&amp;apos;s offer to make him a [[duke]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;See, e.g., [http://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/display/current-displays/benjamin-disraeli1.php Biography] at the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]]&amp;apos;s website&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; accepting instead membership in the [[Order of the Garter]].  The Disraelis died without direct heirs and their titles became extinct; Hughenden Manor passed to Lord Beaconsfield&amp;apos;s nephew [[Coningsby Ralph Disraeli]].
