        text="&lt;p&gt;The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;East Texas Musical Convention&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, now usually called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;East Texas Sacred Harp Convention&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is an annual gathering of shape note singers. Songs are sung [[a cappella]] from the [[Sacred Harp]] tunebook. The Convention was organized in 1855, and is the oldest Sacred Harp convention in [[Texas]], and the second oldest in the [[United States]]. The East Texas Convention was modeled after the older (now defunct) &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Southern Musical Convention]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; established in 1845 by [[Benjamin Franklin White]], the compiler of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Sacred Harp&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

The East Texas Convention has a continuous history from 1868, the earliest year notated in its minutes. [[William Russell Adams]], President of the Convention in 1874, 1884, and 1885, wrote to [[Aldine Silliman Kieffer|Aldine S. Kieffer]], explaining that the convention missed a few years of meeting because of the [[American Civil War]]. Re-established after the war, a large influx of Georgia and Alabama settlers added to its strength. In its early years it was generally considered a forum of Christian worship. Today many are attracted to its [[folk music]] aspect.

Throughout its history, the East Texas Musical Convention has convened annually in six [[East Texas]] counties: [[Gregg County, Texas|Gregg]], [[Harrison County, Texas|Harrison]], [[Panola County, Texas|Panola]], [[Rusk County, Texas|Rusk]], [[Smith County, Texas|Smith]] and [[Upshur County, Texas|Upshur]]. The Convention presently meets for two days in [[Henderson, Texas]] on the weekend of the second Sunday in August. The current &amp;quot;textbook&amp;quot; of the Convention is &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The B. F. White Sacred Harp (2006 Edition)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, first revised by [[Wilson Marion Cooper|W. M. Cooper]] and others in 1902.
