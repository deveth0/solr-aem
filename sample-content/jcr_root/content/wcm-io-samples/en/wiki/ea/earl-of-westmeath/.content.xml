        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earl of Westmeath&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a title in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]. It was created in 1621 for [[Richard Nugent, 1st Earl of Westmeath|Richard Nugent, Baron Delvin]]. During the [[Tudor era]] the loyalty of the Nugent family was often in question, and Richard&amp;apos;s father, the sixth Baron, died in prison while awaiting trial for treason. Richard himself when young was suspected of plotting rebellion and imprisoned, but in later life was a staunch supporter of [[the Crown]], which rewarded him richly for his loyalty. The fifth Earl was a was a [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] in the [[British Army]]. The sixth Earl was sworn of the [[Privy Council of Ireland|Irish Privy Council]] in 1758. His son by his first wife, [[Richard Nugent, Lord Delvin]], was killed in a duel at an early age. Lord Westmeath was succeeded by his second son by his second wife, the seventh Earl. He sat in the [[House of Lords]] as one of the original 28 [[Representative peer|Irish Representative Peers]]; he was also involved in a much-publicised divorce and action for criminal conversation. He was succeeded by his son, the eighth Earl. He was created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marquess of Westmeath&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the [[Peerage of Ireland]] in 1822. He had no surviving male issue and the marquessate became extinct on his death in 1871. He was succeeded in the barony and earldom by his kinsman, Anthony Francis Nugent, the ninth Earl. The eleventh Earl was an Irish Representative Peer from 1901 to 1933.
