&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;James Earl Lawson&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Queen&amp;apos;s Privy Council for Canada|PC]] (October 21, 1891 &amp;amp;ndash; May 13, 1950) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] politician and lawyer.

Lawson was twice a candidate for the [[Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership conventions|leadership]] of the [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party|Ontario Conservative Party]], despite never being a member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]], and once as a candidate for the federal Tory leadership.

His first run for the provincial leadership was in 1920 but was defeated by [[George Howard Ferguson]].

He moved on to federal politics and was elected to the [[Canadian House of Commons]] as a [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] in a 1928 [[by-election]] representing [[York West]]. Lawson was appointed to the [[Canadian cabinet|cabinet]] of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[R.B. Bennett]] in  August 1935 as [[List of Canadian Ministers of National Revenue|Minister of National Revenue]]. He lost this position when the Conservatives were defeated in the fall [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935 election]] but he was elected to the House of Commons, this time representing [[York South]].

Lawson was the &amp;quot;old guard&amp;quot; candidate at the 1938 [[Progressive Conservative leadership convention|Conservative leadership convention]] but placed last after many of his delegates decided to support  [[M. A. Macpherson]] in an unsuccessful attempt to stop [[Robert James Manion]] from becoming leader.

In 1938, several months following his failed attempt to win the federal leadership, he placed second to [[George A. Drew|George Drew]] at the Ontario party&amp;apos;s provincial leadership convention.

Lawson retired from the House of Commons in 1940, but remained active in the party. He was the mover of the successful 1942 motion to change the name of the Conservative Party to the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]].
