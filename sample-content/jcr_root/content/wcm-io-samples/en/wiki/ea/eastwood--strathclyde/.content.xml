[[Image:Scot1975Eastwood.png|thumb|right|Eastwood District 1976 - 96]]

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eastwood&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ([[Scottish Gaelic]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A&amp;apos; Choille an Ear&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Scots language|Scots]]: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eastwid&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was one of nineteen [[local government (Scotland)|local government]] [[Regions and districts (Scotland)|district]]s in the [[Strathclyde]] [[Regions and districts (Scotland)|region]] of [[Scotland]] from 1975 to 1996, lying south-west of the [[City of Glasgow]].

The district was formed from the area of the First District of the former [[counties of Scotland|county]] of [[Renfrewshire (historic)|Renfrewshire]]. The council&amp;apos;s headquarters were at [[Giffnock]]. The district was named after the larger Eastwood [[List of civil parishes in Scotland|civil parish]] itself named after a long-vanished woodland.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=43436#s16 Eastwood, or Pollock, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Topographical Dictionary of Scotland, 1846 (British History Online)]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The district was abolished by the [[Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994]], with its area included in the [[East Renfrewshire]] [[Council areas of Scotland|unitary council area]].

== Constituencies ==

The [[Eastwood (UK Parliament constituency)|Eastwood Westminster constituency]] was created in 1983, and the [[Eastwood (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Eastwood Holyrood constituency]], with the same boundaries, in 1999.

The [[House of Commons (UK)|Westminster]] constituency was renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;East Refrewshire&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 2005. The [[Scottish Parliament|Holyrood]] constituency retains its original name.
