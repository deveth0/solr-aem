&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;East Macedonia and Thrace&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-el|Ανατολική Μακεδονία και Θράκη}}, formally {{lang|el|Περιφέρεια Ανατολικής Μακεδονίας και Θράκης}}) is one of the thirteen [[Modern regions of Greece|regions]] of [[Greece]]. It consists of the northeastern parts of the country, comprising the eastern part of the [[regions of Greece|region]] of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] along with the region of [[Western Thrace|Thrace]], and the islands of [[Thasos]] and [[Samothrace]].

== Administration ==
East Macedonia and Thrace was established in the 1987 administrative reform. With the 2010 [[Kallikratis plan]], its powers and authority were redefined and extended. Along with [[Central Macedonia]], it is supervised by the [[Decentralized Administration of Macedonia and Thrace]] based at [[Thessaloniki]]. The region is based at [[Komotini]] and the largest city is [[Kavala]]. It is divided into the Macedonian [[regional units of Greece|regional units]] of [[Drama (regional unit)|Drama]], [[Kavala (regional unit)|Kavala]] and [[Thasos]] and the Thracian regional units of [[Xanthi (regional unit)|Xanthi]], [[Rhodope (regional unit)|Rhodope]] and [[Evros (regional unit)|Evros]]. Before the Kallikratis reform, the regional units (except Thasos, which was part of Kavala) were administered as separate [[prefectures of Greece|prefectures]]. Since 1994, they were grouped into the [[Drama-Kavala-Xanthi Super-prefecture|Drama-Kavala-Xanthi]] and [[Rhodope-Evros Super-prefecture|Rhodope-Evros]] [[super-prefecture]]s.

The region&amp;apos;s governor is, since 1 January 2011, [[Aristeidis Giannakidis]], who was elected in the [[Greek local elections, 2010|November 2010 local administration elections]] for the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]].
