        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earl of Castlehaven&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[British peerage|peerage]] title in the [[Peerage of Ireland]], created on September 6, 1616. It was held in conjunction with the [[Baron Audley|Barony of Audley]] (created 1312 in the [[Peerage of England]]), the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Barony of Audley of Orier&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (created with the earldom in the Peerage of Ireland), and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Barony of Audley of Hely&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (created for the third Earl in 1633, in the Peerage of England).

Upon the [[attainder]] and execution of the second earl for [[sodomy]], under the [[Buggery Act 1533]] in 1631, he forfeited his English peerage, but not his Irish titles; this was because his English barony of Audley had been created for &amp;apos;&amp;apos;heirs general&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, but his Irish earldom and barony was an entailed honour protected by statute &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[De donis conditionalibus|De Donis]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. His son, the third earl, was created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Audley of Hely&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on June 3, 1633 by letters patent, with the precedence of his grandfather, in an attempt to restore to him the original &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Barony of Audley&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. However, this was deemed insufficient to do so; a bill was passed in Parliament in 1678 which allowed him to inherit the original Barony despite the attainder. Ironically, within months he was barred from the House of Lords as a Roman Catholic under the Second [[Test Act]].

With the death of the eighth earl, the Earldom of [[Castlehaven]] and the Baronies of Audley of Hely and Audley of Orier became extinct. The Barony of Audley created by writ of 1312 devolved upon his nephew, [[George Thicknesse, 19th Baron Audley]].
