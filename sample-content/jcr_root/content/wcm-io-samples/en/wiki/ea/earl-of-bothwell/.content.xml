{{distinguish|Lord Bothwell}}
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earl of Bothwell&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a title that was created twice in the [[Peerage of Scotland]]. It was first created for [[Patrick Hepburn, 1st Earl of Bothwell|Patrick Hepburn]] in 1488, and was forfeited in 1567.  Subsequently, the earldom was re-created for the 4th Earl&amp;apos;s nephew and heir of line, [[Francis Stewart, 1st Earl of Bothwell|Francis Stewart]], whose father was an illegitimate son of [[King James V of Scotland|James V]].  The second creation was forfeited in 1612, and although the heir was subsequently rehabilitated, the title was never restored.

The title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Duke of Orkney&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was created in the [[Peerage of Scotland]] in 1567 for [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]], with the subsidiary title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Marquess of Fife&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.  All titles were declared forfeit in 1567.

==Earls of Bothwell, first creation (1488)==
*[[Patrick Hepburn, 1st Earl of Bothwell]] (d. 1508)
*[[Adam Hepburn, 2nd Earl of Bothwell]] (1492–1513)
*[[Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Earl of Bothwell]] (d. 1556)
*[[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]] (1535–1578) became Duke of Orkney in 1567

==Duke of Orkney (1567)==
*[[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|James Hepburn, 1st Duke of Orkney]] (1535–1578) (forfeit all titles 1567)

==Earls of Bothwell, second creation (1587)==
*[[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell|Francis Stewart, 1st (or 5th) Earl of Bothwell]] (1563–1612)
*Francis Stewart, but for the attainder 2nd (or 6th) Earl of Bothwell (c. 1584–1640)
*Charles Stewart, but for the attainder 3rd (or 7th) Earl of Bothwell (c. 1617–1651)
*Robert Stewart, but for the attainder 4th (or 8th) Earl of Bothwell (fl. 1656)

The next heir appears to have been Captain Francis Stewart of Coldingham, a cavalry officer who commanded the royalist left wing at the [[Battle of Bothwell Brig]] in 1679, and who seems to have died around 1683; the male line has not been traced beyond this point.
