The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eastern Hemisphere&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[geography|geographical]] term for the half of the [[Earth]] that is east of the [[Prime Meridian]] (which crosses [[Greenwich]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]) and west of [[180th meridian|180° longitude]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=275388&amp;amp;fullArticle=true&amp;amp;tocId=203675 Latitude and Longitude] at britannica.com, accessed 2008-05-24&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is also used to refer to [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Australasia]], [[wikt:vis-a-vis|vis-à-vis]] the [[Western Hemisphere]], which includes the [[Americas]]. This hemisphere is called the &amp;quot;Oriental hemisphere&amp;quot;. In addition, it may be used in a [[cultural geography|cultural]] or [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] sense as a synonym for &amp;apos;[[Old World]]&amp;apos;.

The line demarcating the eastern and western hemispheres is an arbitrary convention, unlike the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;equator&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (an imaginary line encircling the [[Earth]], equidistant from its [[geographical pole|poles]]) which divides the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere|southern hemispheres]]. The Prime Meridian at 0° [[longitude]] and the Antimeridian, at 180° longitude are the conventionally accepted boundaries, since they divide eastern longitudes from western longitudes. This convention was established in 1884 at the [[International Meridian Conference]] held in [[Washington, D.C.]] where the [[Standard Time]] concepts of Canadian railroad engineer Sir [[Sandford Fleming]] were adopted. Using this demarcation puts portions of [[western Europe]], Africa and eastern [[Russia]] in the western hemisphere, thereby diluting its usefulness for cartography, as well as for geopolitical constructs, since all of [[Eurasia]] and Africa are typically included in the eastern hemisphere. Consequently, the meridians of [[20th meridian west|20°W]] and the diametrically opposed [[160th meridian east|160°E]] are often used,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Olson, Judy M.  &amp;quot;[http://www.gis.psu.edu/projection/chapter4.html Projecting the hemisphere]&amp;quot;, ch. 4 from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[http://www.gis.psu.edu/projection/ Matching the map projection to the need]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; Robinson, Arthur H. &amp;amp; Snyder, John P., eds. 1997.  Bethesda, MD: Cartography and Geographic Information Society, American Congress on Surveying and Mapping.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Eastern Hemisphere&amp;quot;.  &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Merriam-Webster&amp;apos;s Geographical Dictionary,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 3rd ed.  2001.  Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster, Inc., p. 340.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; which includes all of the European and African mainlands, but also includes a small portion of northeast [[Greenland]] (typically reckoned as part of [[North America]]) and excludes more of eastern Russia and [[Oceania]] (e.g., [[New Zealand]]). Prior to the global adoption of Standard Time, numerous Prime Meridians were decreed by various countries where time was defined by local noon (thereby, local meridian).

The land mass of the Eastern Hemisphere is larger than that of the Western Hemisphere and has a wide variety of [[habitat]]s.
