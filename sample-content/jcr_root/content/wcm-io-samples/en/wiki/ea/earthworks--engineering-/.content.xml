&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earthworks&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are [[engineering]] works created through the moving or processing of parts of the earth&amp;apos;s surface involving quantities of [[soil]] or unformed [[rock (geology)|rock]]. The earth may be moved to another location and formed into a desired shape for a purpose.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Frederick S. Merritt, M. Kent Loftin, Jonathan T. Ricketts, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Standard Handbook for Civil Engineers, Fourth Edition&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1995, Page 13.1&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Much of earthworks involves machine excavation and fill or backfill.

== Types of excavation ==
Excavation may be classified by type of material:&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Frederick S. Merritt, M. Kent Loftin, Jonathan T. Ricketts, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Standard Handbook for Civil Engineers, Fourth Edition&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1995, Page 13.1&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
* Topsoil excavation
* Earth excavation
* Rock excavation
* Muck excavation - this usually contains excess water and unsuitable soil
* Unclassified excavation - this is any combination of material types
Excavation may be classified by the purpose:&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Frederick S. Merritt, M. Kent Loftin, Jonathan T. Ricketts, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Standard Handbook for Civil Engineers, Fourth Edition&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1995, Pages 13.1, 13.2&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
* Stripping
* Roadway excavation
* Drainage or structure excavation
* Bridge excavation
* Channel excavation
* Footing excavation
* Borrow excavation
* Dredge excavation

== Civil engineering use ==
Typical earthworks include [[road#Construction|roads]], [[railway]] beds, [[causeways]], [[dam#Earth dams|dams]], [[levee]]s, [[canal]]s, and [[berm]]s. Other common earthworks are [[land grading]] to reconfigure the topography of a site, or to stabilize slopes.

== Military use ==
In [[military engineer]]ing, earthworks are, more specifically, types of [[fortification]]s constructed from soil. Although soil is not very strong, it is cheap enough that huge quantities can be used, generating formidable structures. Examples of older earthwork fortifications include  [[moat]]s, [[sod]] [[defensive wall|walls]], [[motte-and-bailey]] castles, and [[hill fort]]s. Modern examples include [[trench warfare|trenches]] and [[berm]]s.

== Equipment ==
[[Heavy equipment (construction)|Heavy construction equipment]] is usually used due to the amounts of material to be moved &amp;amp;mdash; up to millions of cubic metres. Earthwork construction was revolutionised by the development of the ([[Fresno Scraper|Fresno]]) [[Wheel tractor-scraper|scraper]] and other [[engineering vehicle|earth-moving machines]] such as the [[loader (equipment)|loader]], [[production trucks]], the [[grader]], the [[bulldozer]], the [[backhoe]], and the [[dragline excavator]].

== Mass haul planning ==
Engineers need to concern themselves with issues of [[geotechnical engineering]] (such as soil density and strength) and with quantity estimation to ensure that soil volumes in the [[Cut (earthmoving)|cuts]] match those of the [[Fill dirt|fills]], while minimizing the distance of movement. In the past, these calculations were done by hand using a [[slide rule]] and with methods such as [[Simpson&amp;apos;s rule]].

Now they can be performed with a [[computer]] and specialized [[Civil engineering software|software]], including optimisation on haul cost and not haul distance (as haul cost is not proportional to haul distance).
