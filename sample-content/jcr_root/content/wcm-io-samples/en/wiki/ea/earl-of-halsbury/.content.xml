&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earl of Halsbury&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in the County of Devon, was a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. Halsbury is a [[manor]] in the parish of [[Parkham]], near Bideford, Devon, long the seat of the Giffard family and sold by them in the 18th. century. The title was created in 1898 for the lawyer and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury|Hardinge Giffard, 1st Baron Halsbury]]. He was [[Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom]] from 1885 to 1886, 1886 to 1892 and 1895 to 1905. Giffard had already been created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Halsbury&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Halsbury in the County of Devon, in 1885, and was made &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscount Tiverton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Tiverton in the County of Devon, at the same time he was given the earldom. Those titles were also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was descended from the family of Giffard of [[Brightley, Chittlehampton]], a junior line of Gifford of Halsbury. A younger son of the first of the Brightley family was Roger Giffard (d.1603) who purchased [[Tiverton Castle]] which he made his home.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Vivian, Heralds&amp;apos; Visitations of Devon, 1895, pp.401-2, pedigree of Giffard&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The 1st Earl in fact had no close connection with Halsbury, as the closest of his ancestors born there was Sir Roger Giffard of Brightley (d.1547) and even less with Tiverton, the home of none of his ancestors but only of a very distant cousin,&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Vivian, Heralds&amp;apos; Visitations of Devon, 1895, pp.401-2, pedigree of Giffard&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  but nevertheless chose these places as his titles. Halsbury&amp;apos;s grandson, the third Earl (who succeeded his father), was a scientist and the first Chancellor of [[Brunel University]]. The fourth Earl did not use his title and did not use the [[courtesy title]] of Viscount Tiverton which he was entitled to from 1943 to 2000. All the titles became extinct on his death in 2010.

[[Stanley Lees Giffard]], father of the first Earl, was the first editor of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Evening Standard|Standard]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; newspaper.

The title of the earldom was pronounced &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hauls&amp;apos;&amp;apos;-bry&amp;quot;.
