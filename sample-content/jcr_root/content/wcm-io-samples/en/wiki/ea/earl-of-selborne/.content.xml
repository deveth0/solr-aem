&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earl of Selborne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, in the County of [[Southampton]], is a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created in 1882 for the lawyer and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician [[Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne|Roundell Palmer, 1st Baron Selborne]], along with the subsidiary title of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscount Wolmer&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Blackmoor in the County of Southampton. He had already been made &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Selborne&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Selborne in the County of Southampton, in 1872, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Both his son, the second Earl, and grandson, the third Earl, were prominent [[Liberal Unionist]] politicians. The latter was in 1941 called to the [[House of Lords]] through a [[writ of acceleration]] in his father&amp;apos;s barony of Selborne. As of 2009 the titles are held by the third Earl&amp;apos;s grandson, the fourth Earl. He is one of the ninety elected [[hereditary peer]]s that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the [[House of Lords Act 1999]], and sits as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]].

The family seat is Temple Manor, near [[Selborne]], [[Hampshire]].
