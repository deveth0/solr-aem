The [[peerage]] title &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earl of Buckingham&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was created several times in the [[Peerage of England]].

It was first created in 1097 for [[Walter Giffard, 1st Earl of Buckingham|Walter Giffard]], but became extinct in 1164 with the death of the second earl.  It may have been created again in 1164 for [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]] (&amp;quot;Strongbow&amp;quot;), who died without issue in 1176.  It was created again in 1377 for [[Thomas of Woodstock]], the youngest son of [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]].  He was created [[Duke of Gloucester]] in 1385.  The dukedom was forfeit on his attainder in 1397, but the earldom passed to his son, Humphrey, but became extinct on his death two years later.  The title was created a fourth time in 1618 for [[Mary Villiers, Countess of Buckingham|Mary Villiers]] for life only.  The title was created for a fifth time in 1617 for her son [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers, 1st Viscount Villiers]], who was subsequently created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Duke of Buckingham&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1623.  All titles became extinct on the death of the second duke in 1687.
