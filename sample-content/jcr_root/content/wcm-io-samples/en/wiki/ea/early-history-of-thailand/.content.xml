The known &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;early history of Thailand&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; begins with the earliest major [[archaeology|archaeological]] site at [[Ban Chiang]]; dating of artifacts from this site is controversial, but there is a consensus that at least by [[3600 BC]], the inhabitants had developed [[bronze]] tools and had begun to cultivate wet [[rice]], providing the impetus for social and political organization.

Later, [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]], [[Mon people|Mon]], and [[Khmer people|Khmer]] civilizations flourished in the region prior to the domination of the Thais, most notably the kingdom of [[Srivijaya]] in the south, the [[Dvaravati]] kingdom in [[central Thailand]] and the [[Khmer Empire]] based at [[Angkor]].

The Thai are part of a larger ethno-linguistic group known as the [[Tai peoples|Tai]], a group which includes the [[Lao people|Lao]], the people of the [[Shan people|Shan]] region of north-eastern [[Burma]], the [[Zhuang people]] of [[Guangxi]] province in China and the [[Thổ people]] and [[Nùng people]] of northern [[Vietnam]]. Migrations from southern China to Southeast Asia took place primarily during the first millennium AD, most likely via northern [[Laos]].

During the first millennium AD the Tai peoples were loosely organised in small entities known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;muang&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. They were heavily influenced by the more advanced cultures around them: the Khmer to the east, and the Hindu cultures of India to the west. Most of the Tai were converted to a form of Hinduism, traces of which can still be seen in Thai religious practice today. Between the 6th and 9th centuries AD, Buddhism was introduced into the Tai-speaking lands, probably via [[Burma]], and became the dominant religion. The [[Theravada]] Buddhism now practised in Thailand was introduced by missionaries from [[Sri Lanka]] in the 13th century.

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Phongsawadannuea&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Chronicle of the North) is a historical record of this period.  The date of first compilation is unknown, but its content stretches from 500 AD down to early 11th century. The recent edition was compiled in early Ratanakosin period.
