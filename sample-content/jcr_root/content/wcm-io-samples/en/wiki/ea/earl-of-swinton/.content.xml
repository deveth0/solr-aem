&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earl of Swinton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created in 1955 for the prominent [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Philip Cunliffe-Lister, 1st Earl of Swinton|Philip Cunliffe-Lister, 1st Viscount Swinton]]. He had already been created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscount Swinton&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Masham in the County of York, in 1935, and was made &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Baron Masham&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of Ellington in the County of York, at the same time he was given the earldom. Born Philip Lloyd-Greame, he was the husband of Mary Constance &amp;quot;Molly&amp;quot; Boynton, granddaughter [[Samuel Cunliffe-Lister, 1st Baron Masham]]. When his wife inherited the large Masham estates in 1924, they assumed the surname of Cunliffe-Lister in lieu of Lloyd-Greame.

The Earl was succeeded by his grandson, the second Earl. He was the eldest son of Major the Hon. John Yarburgh Cunliffe-Lister, who was killed in the [[Second World War]]. Lord Swinton notably served as [[Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard]] (deputy chief government whip in the [[House of Lords]]) from 1982 to 1986 in the Conservative administration of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. His wife was [[Susan Cunliffe-Lister, Baroness Masham of Ilton]]. As of 2009 the titles are held by Lord Swinton&amp;apos;s younger brother, the third Earl, who succeeded in 2006.

The title is named after [[Swinton Park]] near [[Masham]], [[North Yorkshire]]. The family seat is now Dykes Hill House, near [[Masham]], [[North Yorkshire]].
