        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earl of Sussex&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a title that has been created several times in the [[Peerage]]s of [[Peerage of England|England]], [[Peerage of Great Britain|Great Britain]], and the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]. The early [[Earl of Arundel|Earls of Arundel]] (up to 1243) were often also called Earls of Sussex.

The fifth creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1717 in favour of [[Talbot Yelverton, 1st Earl of Sussex|Talbot Yelverton, 2nd Viscount Longueville]]. The Yelverton family descended from [[Christopher Yelverton|Sir Christopher Yelverton]], [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]] from 1597 to 1598. Sir Christopher&amp;apos;s grandson and namesake, [[Sir Christopher Yelverton, 1st Baronet|Christopher Yelverton]], was created a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;baronet&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, of [[Easton Mauduit]] in the County of Northampton, in the [[Baronetage of England]] in 1641. He was succeeded by his son, Sir Henry, the second Baronet. He married Susan Longueville, [[suo jure]] 13th [[Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Baroness Grey de Ruthyn]]. Their eldest son, Charles, succeeded in both the baronetcy and barony. However, he died young and was succeeded by his younger brother, Henry, the fifteenth Baron. In 1690 he was created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Viscount Longueville&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the Peerage of England. His son, Henry, the aforementioned second Viscount, was created &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Earl of Sussex&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in 1727. Henry&amp;apos;s two sons, George and Henry, both succeeded in the earldom. The baronetcy, viscountcy and earldom became extinct on Henry&amp;apos;s death in 1799. He was succeeded in the barony of Grey de Ruthyn by his grandson, [[Henry Yelverton, 19th Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Henry]], the nineteenth Baron, the son of his daughter Lady Barbara Yelverton by Colonel Edward Thoroton Gould. See [[Baron Grey de Ruthyn]] for further history of this title.
