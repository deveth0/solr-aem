&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Easley v. Cromartie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 532 US 234 (2001), also known as Hunt v. Cromartie, was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case.  The court&amp;apos;s ruling on April 18, 2001 stated that redistricting for political reasons did not violate Federal [[Civil Rights]] Law banning race-based [[gerrymandering]]. (Case No. 99-1864).

The Supreme Court held in the case that as [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[African American|blacks]] tend to vote for the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], [[North Carolina&amp;apos;s 12th congressional district]] was drawn based upon voting behavior, instead of upon racial characteristics. The allegedly odd-shaped district was allowed to stand.  Critics of this ruling found this to be a case of judicial nitpicking and that the Court had in essence allowed the previously-banned practice of concentrating a racial group into a single district.
