&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fulgence Bienvenüe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (27 January 1852 – 3 August 1936) was a noted [[France|French]] [[civil engineer]]. He is best known for his role in the construction of the [[Paris Métro]], and had been called &amp;quot;Le Père du Métro&amp;quot; (Father of the Metro).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World&amp;apos;s Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p 162.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

A native of [[Uzel]] in [[Brittany]] and son of a notary, he graduated as a civil engineer in 1872 from the Ecole Polytechnique. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World&amp;apos;s Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p 150&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He began working for the Department of Bridges and Roads at [[Alencon]] in 1872. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World&amp;apos;s Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p 150&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; His first assignment was the construction of various railway lines in the [[Mayenne]] area. In the course of this work, his left arm was crushed in a construction accident and had to be amputated. He relocated to [[Paris]] in 1886. That year, he designed and supervised the construction of aqueducts for the city of Paris, drawing water from the Aube and [[Loire River]]s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World&amp;apos;s Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p 151&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Then, he built a cable railway near the Place de la Republique and created the Buttes-Chaumont Park. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World&amp;apos;s Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p 151&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 1891, he became Engineer-in-Chief of Bridges and Roads, the most prestigious engineering post in France.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World&amp;apos;s Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p 151.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Paris city officials selected Bienvenüe to become chief engineer for the Paris Métro in 1896. He designed a special procedure of building the tunnels to allow the swift repaving of surface roads; this procedure involved (among other things) building the crown of the tunnel first and the flooring last, the reverse of the usual norm at that time. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World&amp;apos;s Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p 151, 162&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He is credited with a largely swift and relatively uneventful construction through the difficult and heterogenous Parisian soils and rocks. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World&amp;apos;s Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. pp. 150–1,162 &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; He would supervise Paris Metro construction for more than three decades, finally retiring on 6&amp;amp;nbsp;December 1932.

Bienvenüe&amp;apos;s construction of the metro was widely lauded and was described admiringly as a work &amp;quot;worthy of the Romans&amp;quot;. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World&amp;apos;s Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p 160, 162 &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Bienvenüe eventually accumulated many honors for his engineering accomplishments, including the Grand Prix Berger of the Academy of Arts and Sciences (1909) and the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor (1929).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; Bobrick, Benson. Labyrinths of Iron: A History of the World&amp;apos;s Subways. New York: Newsweek Books, 1981. p 160&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

On 30&amp;amp;nbsp;June 1933, [[List of stations of the Paris Métro|Avenue du Maine station]] on the Metro was renamed Bienvenüe in his honor. The naming ceremony took place in his presence; there was a last-minute scramble to repaint the station&amp;apos;s new nameboards when it was discovered that the unusual [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|dieresis]] in his name had been omitted (making the French word for &amp;quot;welcome&amp;quot;). In 1942 the station was linked to the adjacent Montparnasse station, forming a single station named [[Montparnasse – Bienvenüe (Paris Métro)|Montparnasse-Bienvenüe]].
