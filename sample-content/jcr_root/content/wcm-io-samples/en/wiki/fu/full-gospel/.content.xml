        text="&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Full Gospel&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is often used as a synonym for [[Pentecostalism]], a [[Protestant]] movement originating in the 19th century. Early Pentecostals saw their teachings on [[baptism with the Holy Spirit]], [[spiritual gifts]], and [[divine healing]] as a return to the doctrines and power of the [[Apostolic Age]]. Because of this many early Pentecostals called their movement the [[Apostolic Faith]] or the Full Gospel.

This term has origins in the [[holiness movement]]. [[A. B. Simpson]], the founder of the [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]], framed his core beliefs around the &amp;quot;Fourfold Gospel&amp;quot;, that Christ is Savior, Sanctifier, Healer, and Soon Coming King. Many Pentecostals were influenced by Simpson and adopted his Fourfold or &amp;quot;Foursquare&amp;quot; Gospel as an articulation of their beliefs. This term is still used today in the name of the [[International Church of the Foursquare Gospel]].

The term &amp;quot;Full Gospel&amp;quot; also refers to Romans 15,18-19, where Paul says: &amp;quot;... to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.&amp;quot;
