&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fusion&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was an [[American comic book]] [[ongoing series|series]] published from [[1987 in comics|1987]]–[[1989 in comics|1989]] by [[Eclipse Comics]], whose creative team included the writer [[Steven Barnes]], the artists [[Lela Dowling]] and [[Steve Gallacci]], conceptual editor [[Lex Nakashima]] and many more.

The world of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fusion&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is centuries in our future, when a series of galactic wars have led to a spiraling [[arms race]] between &amp;quot;tekkers and splicers&amp;quot; — that is, between those who take a technological and technocratic route to improving humanity, and those who have abandoned humanity altogether through genetic engineering. The story involves the exploits of a group of space mercenaries in an era when humans who have not been enhanced either [[genetics|genetically]] or [[cybernetics|cybernetically]], are becoming extremely rare.

From the first issue, the book included two back up series featuring &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dr. Watchstop&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Weasel Patrol&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a comic stemming from doodles &amp;quot;drawn&amp;quot; of Tan.

==Regular characters==
The only recurring characters are the crew of the mercenary [[spacecraft|spaceship]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tsunami&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Indio Tremaine&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: Captain. Human. Born into the Clan of the Three Suns, of which she is the only survivor.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dow Cook&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: Synthetic human bio-engineered invulnerable to shock and trauma and with enhanced self-healing ability. Very insecure about himself.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;musteliform&amp;apos;&amp;apos; bred from [[Earth|Terran]] [[otter]] stock. [[Canada|Canadian]], an alumnus of [[Labatt&amp;apos;s]] Tech (a fictitious university named after the beer). An [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] mechanical and [[electronics]] wizard with a severe [[gambling]] problem. Never goes anywhere without his leather pilot cap and goggles.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Beolvoch&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;meehook&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Something like a [[dinosaur]] with [[feather]]s. Has an extremely high [[metabolism|metabolic rate]] and thus a voracious appetite for [[raw meat]]. Must eat regularly and copiously to stay active. Consequently spends much time in a [[suspended animation]] state or complaining that he is hungry. Appears to be a genuine [[extraterrestrial life|alien species]] rather than [[biological uplift|uplifted]] and genetically engineered &amp;apos;&amp;apos;earthform&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alshain&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;felinoid&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; a temperamental and somewhat edgy pilot.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Carz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;leoniform&amp;apos;&amp;apos; with only one working [[Human eye|eye]]. He is generally a steadying influence, but when he loses it, beware!
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Herrick&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: A hawklike creature, of military [[caste]]. Dies very early in the series, in one of many moves which went against [[formula fiction|formula]]. Appears in [[flashback (literary technique)|&amp;quot;how we got here]]&amp;quot; sequences.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Haven&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: A birdlike creature with well-developed [[nest]]ing instincts. She is a doctor by training.
* &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Eddie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;: Modelled after some creature with very long ears and a [[prehensile tail]]. Likes to hang upside down. A cool dude in [[sunglasses|shades]] and [[khaki]]s or [[Aloha shirt|Hawaiian shirts]]. Nothing rattles Eddie. Was a classmate of Tan at Labatt&amp;apos;s.&lt;/p&gt;" />
