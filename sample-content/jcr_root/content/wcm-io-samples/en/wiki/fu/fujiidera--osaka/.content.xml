{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fujiidera&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|藤井寺市|Fujiidera-shi}} is a [[cities of Japan|city]] located in [[Osaka Prefecture|Osaka]], [[Japan]].

==History==
In 1959 the townships of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fujiidera-cho&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Domyoji-cho&amp;apos;&amp;apos; merged to create &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fujiidera-Domyoji-cho&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. A year later, the town was renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Misasagi-cho&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The present day city of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Fujiidera-shi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was created November 1, 1966.

Though recently demolished, Fujiidera Stadium was owned and used by the now renamed [[Kintetsu Buffaloes]], a Japanese [[baseball]] team with a large fan base in Osaka.

==Transport==
Fujiidera is served by the [[Kintetsu Minami-Osaka Line]] and [[Kintetsu Domyoji Line]], with three railway stations located within the city. [[Fujiidera Station]] is the largest, located close to the City Hall, and surrounded by an area of retail shops; the other two are [[Hajinosato Station|Hajinosato]] and [[Domyoji Station|Domyoji]].

==Geography==
Two major rivers flow through the city; the Yamatogawa (the larger) and the Ishikawa (the smaller, a tributary of the Yamatogawa). Sections of both river banks are maintained for recreation. The rivers are bounded by high [[levee]]s that protect low lying areas from flooding.

== Attractions ==
*The tomb of [[Emperor Ingyo]], the 19th emperor of Japan, is located in Fujiidera.
*Domyoji-Tenmangu, a large [[Shinto]] shrine dedicated to [[Tenjin (kami)|Tenjin]], is located five minutes walk from Domyoji Station. The nearby Doymoji Buddhist convent is considered to have been the family temple of [[Sugawara no Michizane]].
