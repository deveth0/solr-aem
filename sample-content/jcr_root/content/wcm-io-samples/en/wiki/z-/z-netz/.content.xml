The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Z-Netz&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a German [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] network applying [[store and forward]] mechanisms to provide their users with e-mail and discussion groups. It can be compared to the U.S. based [[WWIV]] network or the international [[FidoNet]].

The technical base for the Z-Netz was the software &amp;quot;Zerberus&amp;quot;. Initially the network was called &amp;quot;Zerberus Netz&amp;quot; or just &amp;quot;Zerberus&amp;quot;. When other software applying the &amp;quot;ZConnect&amp;quot; data transfer method became available, the network was renamed to &amp;quot;Z-Netz&amp;quot; to reflect that.

&amp;quot;Zerberus&amp;quot; was developed since 1984. It was later maintained by the &amp;quot;Zerberus GmbH&amp;quot;, which was founded in 1992 and dissolved in 1999.

Several Z-Netz operators maintained gateways into other networks, most notably the [[Usenet]], and even forwarded Z-Netz [[e-mail]] to the [[Internet]] and vice versa. With internet access becoming easily available in [[Germany]] in the late 90s the Z-Netz began to vanish.
