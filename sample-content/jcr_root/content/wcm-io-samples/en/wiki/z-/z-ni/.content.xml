{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zōni&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|雑煮}}, often with the [[Honorific speech in Japanese|honorific]] &amp;quot;o-&amp;quot; as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;o-zōni&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a Japanese [[soup]] containing &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Mochi (food)|mochi]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; rice cakes.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;dijitaru&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Dijitaru daijisen | title = 美保湾 (Miho-wan) | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/| accessdate = 2012-05-20 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo | language = Japanese}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The dish is strongly associated with the [[Japanese New Year]] and its tradition of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[osechi]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ceremonial foods. Zōni is considered the most [[auspicious]] of the dishes eaten on [[New Year&amp;apos;s Day]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;enc&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Japan | title = Zōni | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | accessdate = 2012-05-22 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The preparation of zōni varies both by household and region.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;dijitaru&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Etymology==

Zōni is written in the [[Japanese language]] using two &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[kanji]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; characters. The first, {{linktext|雑}} means &amp;quot;miscellaneous&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;mixed&amp;quot;, and the second, {{linktext|煮}}, means &amp;quot;[[simmering|simmer]]&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;boil&amp;quot;.

==Origin==

It is said that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zōni&amp;apos;&amp;apos; finds its roots in [[samurai]] society cuisine.  It is thought to be a meal that was cooked during field battles, boiled together with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;mochi,&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[vegetable]]s and [[dried food]]s, among other ingredients. It is also generally believed that this original meal, at first exclusive to samurai, eventually became a [[staple food]] of the common people. Zōni was first served as part of a full-course dinner (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[honzen ryori|honzen ryōri]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), and thus is thought to have been a considerably important meal to samurai.

The tradition of eating &amp;apos;&amp;apos;zōni&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on New Year&amp;apos;s Day dates to the end of the [[Muromachi period]] (1336–1573). The dish was offered to the gods in a ceremony on [[New Year&amp;apos;s Eve]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;kokugo&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Nihon Kokugo Daijiten | title = Tone-gawa | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | accessdate = 2012-05-22 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo | language = Japanese}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Variations==

===Stock===
Zōni has numerous regional variations in [[Japan]]. In the [[Kantō region]] zōni consists of a clear soup called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[sumashi-jiru]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; which is flavoured with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[dashi]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a [[Stock (food)|stock]] made from flakes of dried [[skipjack tuna|bonito]] and/or [[kombu]], and [[soy sauce]]. In the [[Kansai region]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Kyushu]] zōni is generally made with a stock of white [[miso]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;kokugo&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

===Mochi===
The preparation of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;mochi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; for the dish also varies by region. In the Kantō region the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;mochi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is cut into squares and grilled before being added to the stock. In the Kansai region a round, boiled mochi is preferred.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;enc&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; In some areas [[taro]] or [[tofu]] is used instead of mochi. This type of zōni is found on some islands or mountainous areas where rice is not grown to a large extent.

===Additions===
Common additions to the soup include [[chicken]], [[fish (food)|fish]] or [[meatball]]s; [[leafy vegetable]]s such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[komatsuna]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or [[spinach]]; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[mitsuba]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (a Japanese [[herb]] similar to [[parsley]]); &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[kamaboko]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; such as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;naruto&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and carrot flakes for colour;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;enc&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; and flakes of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[yuzu]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; peel for its citrus fragrance. Regional specialties are often added. A sprinkle of seven-spice chili flakes (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[shichimi togarashi|shichimi]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is sometimes added at the table.
