        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Z-Stoff&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a name for [[calcium permanganate]] or [[potassium permanganate]] mixed in water. It was normally used as a [[catalyst]] for [[T-Stoff]] ([[high test peroxide]]) in military [[rocket]] programs by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]].

Z-Stoff was used in the cold engine of the [[Messerschmitt Me 163|Messerschmitt Me 163 A]] airplane and in several early guided missiles, like the booster engine used with the [[Henschel Hs 293]] anti-ship guided missile. T-Stoff decomposed by Z-Stoff was commonly used by World War II German military to generate steam for powering of fuel pumps in airplanes and rockets.

The reaction produces [[manganese dioxide]], which tends to clog the steam generators. Later generations used solid-state catalyst instead of its water solution. [http://www.walter-rockets.i12.com/walter/me163a.htm]
