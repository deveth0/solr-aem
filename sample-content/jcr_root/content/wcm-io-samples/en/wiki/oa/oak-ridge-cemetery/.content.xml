&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oak Ridge Cemetery&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a cemetery located in [[Springfield, Illinois]], in the [[United States]].

[[Lincoln&amp;apos;s Tomb]], which serves as the final resting place of [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Mary Todd Lincoln|his wife]] and all but one of his children, is located at Oak Ridge.  A number of other prominent politicians and persons from [[Illinois]] are also buried at the cemetery.

As a result of Lincoln&amp;apos;s Tomb, Oak Ridge is the second-most visited cemetery in the United States, after [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.graveyards.com/IL/Sangamon/oakridge/ www.graveyards.com]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Oak Ridge is the 3rd and now only public cemetery in Springfield, the other two cemeteries were the City Cemetery and Hutchinson.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;National Register of Historic Places&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Oak Ridge was designed by William Saunders as part of the Rural Cemetery Landscape Lawn Style.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;National Register of Historic Places&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The location of the cemetery was carefully selected because of the topography, which included rolling hills which was key in the Rural Cemetery Landscape Lawn Style. The many oak trees in the cemetery is how Oak Ridge got its name.

The newest section, in the southwest, of Oak Ridge opened after 1945. The design follows the Memorial Park style cemetery in which roadways are wider to accommodate vehicles.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;National Register of Historic Places&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The Cemetery has memorials for the [[Korean War]], [[World War II Illinois Veterans Memorial|World War II]] and the [[Illinois Vietnam Veterans Memorial]].
