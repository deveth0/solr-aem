&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bulldog Drummond&amp;apos;s Secret Police&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 1939 American country house murder [[mystery film]] directed by [[James Patrick Hogan]], based on the [[H. C. McNeile]] [[novel]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Temple Tower&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Plot==
An absent minded Professor Downie makes a call upon Drummond as he is making plans for his much-delayed wedding to fiancee Phyllis Claverling. The professor informs Drummond that a fortune was buried in one of the walled off storerooms underneath his estate, and that Downie was in possession of a book written in code that would lead them to discover the treasure. Unfortunately for the professor, someone else also wanted the riches and Drummond once again is dragged into the plot as the code book is stolen, Professor Downie is murdered, and Phyllis is kidnapped.

* [[Elspeth Dudgeon]] as Housekeeper&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;BFI&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6a6aa5a7|title=BFI: Bulldog Drummond&amp;apos;s Secret Police|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Notes==
The film uses [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s from previous Drummond films and dream sequences extensively, which has led some to criticize it as tiresome.  Oddly, despite the phrase &amp;apos;[[secret police]]&amp;apos; in the title, there is nothing relating to any secret police in the plot except Col. Neilsen&amp;apos;s quip when several of the characters are together.  The production values are high as the sets are of high quality, but the script has not received much acclaim.
