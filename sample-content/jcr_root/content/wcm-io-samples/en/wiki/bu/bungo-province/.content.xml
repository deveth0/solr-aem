{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bungo Province&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|豊後国|Bungo no kuni}} was a [[Provinces of Japan|province]] of [[Japan]] in eastern [[Kyūshū]] in the area of [[Ōita Prefecture]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[[Louis-Frédéric|Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric]]. (2005). &amp;quot;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bungo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot; in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Japan Encyclopedia&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, p. 90|page=90}}.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It was sometimes called {{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hōshū&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|豊州}}, with [[Buzen Province]]. Bungo bordered [[Buzen Province|Buzen]], [[Hyūga Province|Hyūga]], [[Higo Province|Higo]], [[Chikugo Province|Chikugo]], and [[Chikuzen Province|Chikuzen]] Provinces.

==History==
At the end of 7th century, [[Toyo Province]] was split into &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Buzen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (literally, &amp;quot;the front of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Toyo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bungo&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;the back of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Toyo&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;quot;). Until the [[Heian period]], Bungo was read as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Toyokuni no Michi no Shiri&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

It is believed that the capital of Bungo was located in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kokokufu&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (古国府),  literally &amp;quot;old capital,&amp;quot; section of the city of [[Ōita, Ōita|Ōita]] but to this day, no remains have been found.

The honor of the holiest [[Shinto]] shrine of Bungo province (豊前一宮, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Buzen ichinomiya&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was given to [[Usa Shrine]] known as Usa Hachimangu or Usa Jingu in Usa district (today [[Usa, Ōita]]). Usa shrine had not only religious authority but also political influence to local governance, but their influence was reduced until the Sengoku period.

During the [[Sengoku Period]], in the middle of 16th century, Bungo was a stronghold of the [[Ōtomo clan]]. The [[Ōuchi clan]] in the western [[Chūgoku Region]] was influenced to Buzen politics. In the middle of the period, both clans declined. After [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] also took the power in Kyūshū, 120 thousand [[koku]] of Buzen province was given to [[Kuroda Yoshitaka]] since 1587, who made [[Kokura]], currently part of [[Kitakyushu, Fukuoka]], his site and built the castle. Other parts of the province were divided into pieces and given to other [[daimyo]].

In the [[Meiji period]], the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures.  Maps of Japan and Bungo Province were [[reform]]ed in the 1870s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Nussbaum, [http://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;amp;pg=PA780&amp;amp;dq= &amp;quot;Provinces and prefectures&amp;quot;] at p. 780.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sasamuta-jinja]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Yusuhara Hachiman-gū]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; were the chief [[Shinto shrine]]s (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[ichinomiya]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) of Bungo.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/images/uploads/EOS070712Ab.pdf &amp;quot;Nationwide List of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ichinomiya&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,&amp;quot; p. 3]; retrieved 2012-1-18.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
