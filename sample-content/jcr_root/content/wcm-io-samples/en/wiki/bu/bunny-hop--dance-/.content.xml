The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;bunny hop&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[novelty dance]] that was created at [[Balboa High School (San Francisco)|Balboa High School]] in [[San Francisco]] in 1952.&amp;lt;ref name=time&amp;gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,817795,00.html &amp;quot;New Pop Records&amp;quot;], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Time Magazine]], January 26, 1953&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It is a [[social dance|social]] [[mixer dance]], sometimes also referred to as a &amp;quot;party&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;dance party&amp;quot; dance.

The [[dance]] has been generally done to [[Ray Anthony]]&amp;apos;s [[Big Band|big band]] recording of the [[song]].&amp;lt;ref name=time/&amp;gt; It was a vocal hit in 1952, and instrumentally re-recorded c. 1958. The song has been re-recorded by others, including musical updates of the style, for example, a [[Salsa (music)|Salsa]] version.  [[Duke Ellington]] recorded &amp;quot;Bunny Hop Mambo&amp;quot; in 1954.  Other popular music of the era is also used, such as &amp;quot;[[The Glow-Worm]].&amp;quot;

Ray Anthony&amp;apos;s [[single (music)|single]] release of the &amp;quot;Bunny Hop&amp;quot; featured another novelty dance classic, the &amp;quot;[[Hokey Pokey]]&amp;quot; on the [[B side]].

==Description==
The dance is a variation on a [[conga line]].  Participants dance in a line, holding on to the hips of the person in front of them.  They tap the floor two times with their right foot, then with their left foot, then they hop forwards, backwards, and finally three hops forward to finish the sequence, which continues throughout the tune. The first person in the line leads the group around the floor.

The Finnish dance style called &amp;quot;Jenkka&amp;quot; has essentially the same steps. Originating from the 19th century, jenkka is actually the same dance style as the German slow tempo polka called schottische or rheinlÃ¤nder. It is characterised by three quick steps and a hop and is danced to music in 2/4  time. Finnjenkka, also known as letkajennkka and letkis, is one of the many  variations of jenkka. Typical to it is that all the people dancing form a line and hold on to the one in front by the waist.

==In popular culture==
The Bunny Hop is shown in the [[Family Ties]] pilot when Alex goes to a country club event and mentioned again in the episode &amp;quot;Karen II, Alex 0&amp;quot;.

In the [[Friends]] episode &amp;quot;The one in Massapequa&amp;quot;, guest star [[Alec Baldwin]] asks Phoebe if she wants to do the Bunny Hop in Monica&amp;apos;s parents aniversary party.

In the [[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]] episode &amp;quot;Fresh Prince After Dark&amp;quot;, Carlton is seen doing the Bunny Hop at the Playboy Mansion.

In the [[Everybody Loves Raymond]] episode &amp;quot;The Walk to the Door&amp;quot;, one of the main characters [[Robert Barone]] dances to the bunny hop at a family wedding.

Cave Story uses the Jenka music.
