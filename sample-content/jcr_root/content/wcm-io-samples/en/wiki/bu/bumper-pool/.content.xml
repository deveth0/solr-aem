[[File:Bumper pool table.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Rectangular bumper pool table]]
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bumper pool&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Pocket (billiards)|pocket billiards]] game played on an [[octagon]]al or [[Rectangle|rectangular]] table fitted with an array of fixed cushioned obstacles, called bumpers, at the center of its surface.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bw-bump&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

== Table ==
Typically bumper pool tables are smaller than a regulation [[Billiard table#Pocket_billiards_.28pool.29_tables|pool table]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bpt-home&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; The table has two pockets, placed opposite one another, located at the center of two of the rails.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

Most tables have twelve bumpers, although some tables have fourteen or sixteen.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bpt-home&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Two bumpers flank each pocket.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; The remaining bumpers are arranged in a cross in the center of the table, with one line of the cross in line with the pockets.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; At the center of the cross, there is an open space just large enough to allow a ball to pass through.  Tables with fourteen bumpers have three rather than two bumpers on each side of the center space on the line midway between the two holes.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

== Gameplay ==

The game is played with 5 red and 5 white [[Billiard ball|balls]], with one marked ball in each set.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bw-bump&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bpt-rules&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; At the start of play, each set of balls is arranged on five spots near each edge of the table by a [[Pocket (billiards)|pocket]] with the marked ball placed directly in front of the [[Pocket (billiards)|pocket]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; The object is for a player to sink all of their balls into their [[Pocket (billiards)|pocket]] at the opposite end of the table.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bpt-rules&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; A player&amp;apos;s marked ball must be sunk before the player can sink any other balls.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bpt-rules&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Unlike most other billiard games, there is no designated [[cue ball]]: each ball can be shot into the [[Pocket (billiards)|pocket]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bw-bump&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

To begin play, both players shoot their marked ball simultaneously, [[Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#bank_shot|banking]] the ball off the cushion to their right and attempting to sink their ball in their [[Pocket (billiards)|pocket]] at the other end of the table.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bw-bump&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; If both players sink their first shot they each select another ball, place it in front of their opponent&amp;apos;s [[Pocket (billiards)|pocket]], and repeat the simultaneous shot.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bw-bump&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  If both players successfully sink all five of their balls in this fashion the game ends in a [[Tie (draw)|draw]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bw-bump&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;

If, on the initial simultaneous shot, one player fails to sink his or her marked ball in the [[Pocket (billiards)|pocket]], the player who successfully sank a ball or who came closest to his or her own pocket shoots next. A player&amp;apos;s turn continues until he or she fails to sink a ball.

== Fouls ==
If a player sinks one of the opponent&amp;apos;s balls there is no penalty. However, the ball is considered sunk regardless of which [[Pocket (billiards)|pocket]] it drops in. If a player sinks one of his own balls (but not the last) in their opponent&amp;apos;s [[Pocket (billiards)|pocket]], the opponent may drop two balls into their pocket.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  A player sinking their last ball in the wrong pocket loses the game.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  If a player causes a ball to leave the table, their opponent may place that ball anywhere on the table (usually in the middle space surrounded by bumpers) and may (depending on local custom&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;) drop two of their balls into their [[Pocket (billiards)|pocket]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bw-bump&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bptf&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bpt-rules&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
