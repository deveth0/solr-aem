&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Burleigh Head&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small national park at [[Burleigh Heads, Queensland|Burleigh Heads]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in  [[South East Queensland]], [[Australia]], 81&amp;amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Brisbane]]. The park is tiny yet it contains a diverse range of habitats. [[Tallebudgera Creek]] enters the ocean directly south of the park. No camping is permitted in the park. Access is via the [[Gold Coast Highway]] which passes by the park. An information centre is available.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;qh&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

Burleigh Head National Park is a popular place for hiking, walkers and joggers because it located in a cool climate and provides great views. There are two walking tracks in the national park, one climbing the hill to the summit which is about 88&amp;amp;nbsp;m above sea level, called the Rainforest circuit and another leading around the headland just above sea level called the Ocean view circuit. Watching migrating whales from within the park is another popular activity.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;qh&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queenslandholidays.com.au/things-to-see-and-do/burleigh-head-national-park/index.cfm |title=Burleigh Head National Park |publisher=Tourism Queensland |accessdate=4 November 2010}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Landform==
The headland has steep sides and is 80&amp;amp;nbsp;m in height.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;naq&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book |title=Natural areas of Queensland |last=Shilton |first=Peter |year=2005 |publisher=Goldpress |location=Mount Gravatt, Queensland |isbn=0-9758275-0-2 |pages=156â€“159 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  The formation of the Burleigh [[headland]] began between 23 to 25&amp;amp;nbsp;million years ago. At this time the [[Tweed Volcano]] was active. Molten basalt lava from the volcano flowed all the way down the valleys and eroded them all. The valleys were covered in hardened sedimentary rocks before reaching what is now the Burleigh headland. Along Tallebudgera Creek there are rocky platforms and sandy beaches.  On the seaside part of the park are black boulders at the base of a cliff.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;naq&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

The headland was an important cultural site for the local Aboriginal tribe known as the Minjungbal people.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;naq&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;

==Flora==
The park preserves remnant areas of rainforest and mangrove forests. Western parts are dominated by dry eucalypt forest containing species such as [[Brush Box]], [[Forest Red Gum]] and [[Grey Ironbark]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;naq&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; On the seaward facing slopes are [[Swamp she-oak]], native hibiscus tree and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pandanus]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; palms. There are also areas of heathland and tussock grassland.

==Fauna==
The [[Australian Brush-turkey]], [[brahminy kite]]s, [[sea eagle]]s and [[koala]]s can be found in the park.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;bhnp&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2007/07/04/194_hinterland-rainforest.html |title=Burleigh Heads National Park |accessdate=4 November 2010 |publisher=News Limited }}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; There are also [[Lace Monitor]]s, [[Echidna]]s, [[Mountain Brushtail Possum]]s, [[Common Brushtail Possum]]s and [[Common Ringtail Possum]]s. [[Rainbow Lorikeets]] are commonly seen feeding on blossoms in the park.
