Akiko tried to promote tanka by writing a few beginners&amp;apos; guides and ...&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Saishū wrote a poetry column for the magazine &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Shinsei&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;New Voices&amp;quot;). He also founded the Shazensō Sha (&amp;quot;Plantain Society&amp;quot;) in 1905, which stressed clarity, simplicity, and capturing ordinary experiences in poetry.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Seiko Tanabe A Thousand Strands of Black Hair Translated by Meredith McKinney - Page 222 &amp;quot;Onoe had been a disciple of Ochiai Naobumi at Asakasha in the days when tekkan was also in his fold, but had since formed the [[Ikazuchi Society]] with [[Kubo Inokichi]] and [[Hattori Motoharu]], and undertaken a tanka reform movement. The Ikazuchi poets had a different approach from the [[Myojo]] group, ...&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; This was in reaction to the style of the tanka poets associated with &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Myōjō]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; magazine (such as [[Yosano Akiko]]) which emphasized the passionate side of human nature. Members of the Shazensō Sha included the noted &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Naturalist&amp;apos;&amp;apos; tanka poets [[Wakayama Bokusui]] and [[Maeda Yugure| Maeda Yūgure]] (who had been tutored by Onoe Saishū).
