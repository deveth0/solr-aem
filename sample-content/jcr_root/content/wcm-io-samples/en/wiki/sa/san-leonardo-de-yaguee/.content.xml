&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;San Leonardo de Yagüe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[Spain|Spanish]] town and [[municipality]] located in the [[Soria (province)|Province of Soria]], part of the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Castile and León]]. It is one of the most populated municipalities {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} of the Sorian county of Pinares.

It has primary and secondary schools (I.E.S. San Leonardo), attended by students from surrounding municipalities ([[Navaleno]], Hontoria del Pinar, Casarejos, Espeja, Espejón, La Hinojosa, and others).

The town, which has about 2,500 inhabitants, is home to the Puertas Norma timber products factory, a manufacturer of doors and pre-hung door units. The factory employs about 700 workers.

== History ==
The foundation date of the village is unknown, but it is supposed to be in the 10th or 11th century. The oldest document where the village is mentioned is from 1173, in a privilege card given by [[Alfonso VIII]].

The village is the birthplace of [[Juan Yagüe]] in 1891. Yagüe, a general in [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]&amp;apos;s army, became notorious for instigating the [[Massacre of Badajoz|massacre at Badajoz]] in 1936. The village was renamed after Yagüe following his death in 1952, becoming San Leonardo de Yagüe.
