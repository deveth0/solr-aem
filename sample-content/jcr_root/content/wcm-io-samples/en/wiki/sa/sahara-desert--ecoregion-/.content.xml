The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sahara desert [[ecoregion]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, as defined by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF), includes the hyper-arid center of the [[Sahara]], between 18° and 30° N.&amp;lt;ref name=WWF/&amp;gt; It is one of several [[deserts and xeric shrublands|desert and xeric shrubland]] ecoregions that cover the northern portion of the [[Africa]]n continent.

==Setting==
The Sahara is the world&amp;apos;s largest hot [[desert]], located in northern Africa. It stretches from the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The vast Sahara encompasses several ecologically distinct regions. The Sahara desert ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|4,619,260|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in the hot, hyper-arid center of the Sahara, surrounded on the north, south, east, and west by desert ecoregions with higher rainfall and more vegetation.&amp;lt;ref name=WWF/&amp;gt;

The [[North Saharan steppe and woodlands]] ecoregion lies to the north and west, bordering the [[Mediterranean climate]] regions of Africa&amp;apos;s [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[North Atlantic]] coasts. The North Saharan steppe and woodlands receives more regular winter rainfall than the Sahara desert ecoregion. The [[South Saharan steppe and woodlands]] ecoregion lies to the south, between the Sahara desert ecoregion and the [[Sahel]] grasslands. The South Saharan steppe and woodlands receives most of its annual rainfall during the summer. The Red Sea coastal desert lies in the coastal strip between the Sahara desert ecoregion and the [[Red Sea]].

Some mountain ranges rise up from the desert and receive more rainfall and cooler temperatures. These Saharan mountains are home to two distinct ecoregions; the [[West Saharan montane xeric woodlands]] in the [[Ahaggar]], [[Tassili n&amp;apos;Ajjer]], [[Aïr]], and other ranges in the western and central Sahara, and the [[Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands]] in the [[Tibesti]] and [[Jebel Uweinat]] of the eastern Sahara.

The surface of the desert ranges from large areas of sand dunes (erg), to stone plateaus (hamadas), gravel plains (reg), dry valleys (wadis), and salt flats. The only permanent river that crosses the ecoregion is the [[Nile River]], which originates in central Africa and empties northwards into the Mediterranean Sea. Some areas encompass vast underground aquifers resulting in [[oasis|oases]], while other regions severely lack water reserves.

===Climate===
The Sahara desert generally features an [[arid climate]]. The Sahara desert is one of the hottest regions of the world, with a mean temperature over 30 °C (86 °F). Daily variations may also be extreme: a swing from {{convert|37.5|to|-0.5|C|F|0}} has been observed.&amp;lt;ref name=WWF&amp;gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa1327|name=Sahara Desert|accessdate=2011-03-21}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The Sahara receives very little rain in the [[Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone]] which moves up from the south.&amp;lt;ref name=WWF/&amp;gt; Wind and sand storms occur as soon as early spring. Local inhabitants protect themselves from heat, cold and mostly wind and sand by covering their heads, such as the [[cheche]] worn by [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]].

==History and conservation==
The Sahara was one of the first regions of Africa to be farmed. Some 5,000 years ago, the area was not so arid and the vegetation might have been closer to a [[savanna]]. Previous fauna may be recognised in stone carvings. However, [[desertification]] set in around 3000 BCE, and the area became much like it is today.

The Sahara is largely undisturbed.&amp;lt;ref name=WWF/&amp;gt; The most degradation is found in areas where there is water, such as [[oasis|aquifer oases]] or along the desert margins where some rain usually falls most years. In these areas, animals such as [[addax]]es, [[scimitar-horned oryx]]es, and [[bustard]]s are [[over-hunting|over-hunted]] for their meat. Only one area of [[conservation ethic|conservation]] is recorded in the Sahara: the Zellaf Nature Reserve in Libya.&amp;lt;ref name=WWF/&amp;gt;
