&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Saab 98&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was the number used by [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] for a project in 1974 making a [[combi coupé]] based on the [[Saab 95]].
Originally it was called X14. The construction of the 98 was based on the [[Saab 95]] floorpan and the design was made by [[Björn Envall]]. The [[prototype]] was assembled by [[Sergio Coggiola]] who had already done work on the [[Saab Sonett]] III.

Only &amp;quot;a couple of test cars&amp;quot;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://saab-club.com/the-saab-way/story/story.htm &amp;amp;quot;The SAAB Way&amp;amp;quot;] by [[Gunnar A. Sjögren]], page 57.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; were built up to 1976 and the project was abandoned as Saab decided there was no room in the market for a car between the [[Saab 95]] and [[Saab 99]]. The project was, nonetheless, an interesting development of a much-loved model (the 95) and might have delayed that successful format&amp;apos;s demise, had this model achieved production status.

The only surviving 98, in &amp;apos;Siena Brown&amp;apos;, licence plate (Swedish) AYX 330, is currently on display in the Saab [[Museum]] in [[Trollhättan]].
