        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;San Juan Hill&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a series of hills to the east of [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]], [[Cuba]] running north to south and known as the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;San Juan Heights&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] &amp;quot;Alturas de San Juan&amp;quot; before [[Spanish-American War]] of 1898.  {{coord|20.020018|N|75.798212|W|display=inline}} Now part of an area called &amp;quot;Lomas de San Juan.&amp;quot;

These were the heights where Spanish soldiers entrenched themselves in the most famous battle of the Spanish-American War; the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]]. The Americans named the lesser heights, &amp;quot;Kettle Hill&amp;quot; and the higher southern hill, &amp;quot;San Juan Hill&amp;quot; after the battle July 2, 1898. The two high points or hills are connected by a draw or saddle on a north-south axis.

The fight for the San Juan heights or hills became known as the battle of &amp;quot;San Juan Hill&amp;quot; due to a reporter&amp;apos;s telegraph typo dropping the &amp;quot;s.&amp;quot;  American Army reports also referred to the heights as hills.
