&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Savage River&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a national park in [[Tasmania]] ([[Australia]]), 233&amp;amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Hobart, Australia|Hobart]]. It is the largest undisturbed area of [[temperate rainforest]] in Australia.

The Savage River National Park was created as part of the [[Regional Forestry Agreement]] in 1999 to allow natural processes to continue undisturbed, consequently visitors will find there are no recreational facilities or developments inside the reserve. The reserve is approximately 5% of the greater [[Tarkine]] area, and is a habitat rich in tiger snakes and very heavily leech infested.
