&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Safavi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-fa|صفوی}}) is a [[Persian people|Persian]] surname, best known as the surname of the royal family of the [[Safavid Dynasty]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{Cite book|title=Persia|author= Brigadier-General Sir Percy Sykes|year=2007|isbn=1-4067-4434-4}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Etymology==
Some have argued that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Safavi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a cognate of the word &amp;quot;[[Safaviya (sufi order)|Safaviyeh]]&amp;quot;. And that &amp;quot;Safa&amp;quot; is a cognate of the word [[Sufi]].

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Safavi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an adjective, created for the name &amp;quot;Safi&amp;quot;. Translated to English, &amp;quot;Safavi&amp;quot; would correspond roughly to &amp;quot;Safi-ish&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Safidian&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Safavi&amp;quot; is the correct [[Persian language]] reference to &amp;quot;Safi&amp;quot;, the name of Sheikh [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili]]. Similarly we speak of &amp;quot;[[Edwardian]]&amp;quot;, when making a reference to the era affiliated with king [[Edward VII]]. Sheikh Safi&amp;apos;s descendants have been going by this name for 770 years. There are numerous bearers of the name &amp;quot;Safavi&amp;quot; thriving in modern day [[Iran]], who claim descent from [[Sheikh Safi]] or any of his royal heirs.

Many &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Safavi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s can still be found in [[East Azerbaijan]], [[Ardebil Province]] and [[Isfahan Province]] &amp;amp;ndash; the former capital of the [[Safavid dynasty]] &amp;amp;ndash; and can also be found in [[Mashhad]], [[Razavi Khorasan]] province. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Safavi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s can also be found all across [[Iran]]. Another branch of the family is found in [[Kashmir]], while another is found in [[South Lebanon]] under the names Safa, Safawi and Jaber, a branch of the Safa family.

==Safavid==
The term &amp;quot;[[Safavid]]&amp;quot;, as in [[Safavid Dynasty]] (of which Sheikh Safi is the [[Eponym]]), is likewise referred to as &amp;quot;Safavi&amp;quot; by Persian speakers. The &amp;quot;d&amp;quot; at the end of &amp;quot;Safavid&amp;quot; was added by the principle of analogy with the Greek-derived names of several ancient dynasties, such as the [[Achaemenid dynasty]] and the [[Sassanid dynasty]], based on the oblique cases of the Greek names. The English adjective &amp;quot;[[Safavid]]&amp;quot; and the name &amp;quot;[[Safavids]]&amp;quot; for the dynasty, and the corresponding forms in many European languages, are therefore based on a redundant application of adjective-forming rules.

The names &amp;quot;[[Safavid]]/[[Safavids]]&amp;quot; are well-established in the English language, however, and have become legitimate terms. When added to a Shah&amp;apos;s name however, the original &amp;quot;Safavi&amp;quot;, without the &amp;quot;d&amp;quot; at the end, must always be retained, e.g., [[Shah Ismail I]] Safavi.

There was a branch of the Safavi Family (direct descendants of Shah Abbas) that settled in parts of Northern and Central India under the titles &amp;quot;Abbasi&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Alavi&amp;quot;.
