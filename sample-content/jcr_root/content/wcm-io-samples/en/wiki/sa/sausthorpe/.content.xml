&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sausthorpe&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a small village and [[civil parish]] in the [[East Lindsey]] [[Non-metropolitan district|district]] of [[Lincolnshire]], England. It is situated {{convert|8|mi|km}} east from [[Horncastle, Lincolnshire|Horncastle]] and {{convert|3|mi|km}} north-west from [[Spilsby]]. Sausthorpe is within the [[Lincolnshire Wolds]] valley of the [[River Lymn]], and on the southern edge of the Lincolnshire Wolds [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].

The name is believed to derive from &amp;quot;Sauthr&amp;apos;s thorpe&amp;quot;, a farming settlement here in [[Viking]] times.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Cameron, Kenneth (1998); &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A Dictionary of Lincolnshire Place-names&amp;apos;&amp;apos;,  English Place-Name Society. ISBN 0904889580{{page needed|date=July 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Farming remains the predominant economic activity of the area.

The [[parish church]] is dedicated to [[St Andrew]] and is a Grade II [[listed building]]. It was designed by Charles Kirk and built in 1842 on the site of an earlier medieval church.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|title=St Andrews, Sausthorpe|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1034892&amp;amp;sort=4&amp;amp;search=all&amp;amp;criteria=sausthorpe&amp;amp;rational=q&amp;amp;recordsperpage=20|work=Pastscape|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{NHLE|num=1063638|desc=St Andrews, Sausthorpe|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Its construction was sponsored by Rev. Francis A. Swan, [[Lord of the Manor]] and parish rector from 1819 until his death in 1878.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The spire is a prominent local landmark, and resembles on a smaller scale the spire of [[St. James Church, Louth]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} to the north. [[T. Pelham Dale]] [[Society of the Holy Cross|SSC]], who was prosecuted and imprisoned for [[Ritualism|ritualist]] practices in 1876 and 1880, and thus regarded as a martyr by [[Anglo-Catholics]], was the parish priest from 1881-1892;{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} his grave can be seen under the trees on the eastern side of the [[churchyard]].  Inside the church, several [[Dymoke]] family gravestones dating from the 18th century can be seen; these were left in place from the earlier church.

In 1885 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Kelly&amp;apos;s Directory]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; recorded the Rev. Charles Trollope Swan [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]] as living at Sausthorpe Hall, a &amp;quot;modern mansion in a park of 30 acres&amp;quot;.  (He had inherited the roles of Lord of the Manor and rector from his father Francis Swan in 1878.)

Charles Trollope Swan gave the rectorate, including the rectory living, residence (the Old Hall, see below) and {{convert|34|acre|km2|2}} of [[glebe]] land, to T. Pelham Dale in 1882.

Rev. Francis A. Swan built a [[National school (England and Wales)|National School]] for 50 children, in 1860.  (The school finally closed in 1983.)

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kelly&amp;apos;s Directory&amp;apos;&amp;apos; also recorded that in 1885 the area of the parish was {{convert|727|acre|km2|1}}, in which were grown wheat, barley and turnips, that Sausthorpe&amp;apos;s population at the time of the 1881 [[census]] was 141, and that within the parish were a grocer, wheelwright, carrier, two farmers, a farmer-cum-beer retailer, and a farmer-surveyor.&amp;lt;ref name=Kellys&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Kelly&amp;apos;s Directory of Lincolnshire with the port of Hull&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 1885, p.&amp;amp;nbsp;611&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Sausthorpe Hall is a late 18th-century Grade II listed country house, extended and remodelled in 1822.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{NHLE|num=1063637|desc=Sausthorpe Hall|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The Old Hall is a Grade II* listed 15th-century house, with 16th- and 18th-century alterations. It consists of render over red brick and the remains of a timber frame.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{NHLE|num=1063639|desc=The Old Hall, Sausthorpe|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
