The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sager House&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{Lang-sv|Sagerska huset}}) or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sager Palace&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sagerska palatset&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is the official residence of the [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] of [[Sweden]] at Strömgatan 18 in Stockholm.

== Location and Environment ==
It is located in Stockholm&amp;apos;s borough &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Norrmalm (borough)|Norrmalm]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the street &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Strömgatan&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on the North side of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Norrström&amp;apos;&amp;apos; river between [[Rosenbad]], the Government Chancellery (in the West), and the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]] (the former &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Arvfurstens Palats]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Gustav Adolfs torg]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (in the East). It lies across from the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]] building (on the island [[Helgeandsholmen]]) and the [[Royal Palace in Stockholm|Royal Palace]] (on the island [[Stadsholmen]]) and it connected with them over the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Norrström&amp;apos;&amp;apos; river through the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Riksbron&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Norrbro]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; bridges, respectively.

==History==
The first historical records of a building on the site are from the 1640s. In 1880 the property was purchased by the Sager brothers and in 1893 Robert Sager had the palace remodeled and a new floor was added. At this point the house got the French [[rococo]] style that it still has today. The palace was owned by the Sager family until 1986 and in 1988 it was purchased by the Swedish state to be turned into the official residence of the Prime Minister of Sweden. Formerly there was no official residence for the head of government. The first Prime Minister to use the building after an extensive renovation for its new use was [[Göran Persson]] (1996-2006). [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]] moved in after the [[Swedish general election, 2006]].
