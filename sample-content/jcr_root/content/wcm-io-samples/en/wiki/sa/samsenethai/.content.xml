&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Samsenethai&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (also called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Oun Huan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) was the second king of [[Lan Xang]], the son of [[Fa Ngum]], whom he succeeded.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.royalark.net/Laos/lanxang1.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

He ruled from 1372 until 1417. The origin of the name Samsenethai is thought to be a reflection of the political and social upheaval occurring within the area at the time of his rule. Samsenethai literally means &amp;quot;300,000 Thai,&amp;quot; thus reflected the result of a census conducted in his reign. It is unclear whether the census included the entire population or just men capable of bearing arms. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

There is also discussion as to whether during this period, the terms &amp;quot;Thai&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Lao&amp;quot; were interchangeable, whether the term &amp;quot;Lao&amp;quot; yet{{explanation needed}} existed, or whether &amp;quot;Thai&amp;quot; was used in his name to refer to the fact that the census included all [[Tai peoples|Tai]] groups. For the duration of 43 year reign, Lan Xang did not fight a single battle. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Samsenethai had five daughters; Princess [[Keo Koumari]], Princess [[Anousa]], Princess [[Manora (princess)|Manôra]], Princess [[Souphutta]], and Princess [[Siva Yaka]].
He had three sons by Princess [[Ngo Fa]] of Ayutthaya; Prince [[Lan Kham Dèng]], Prince [[Prince Sai|Sai]], Prince [[Khamtèm]]. His other sons, Prince [[Kongkèo]], Prince [[Lu Xay]], and Prince [[Fa Kheun]]&amp;apos;s mother was Princess [[Noy Onsa]] of [[Lan Na]].

[[Wat Manorom]], [[Wat Oubôsôt]], and [[Wat Xiang Kham]] were built in Samsenethai&amp;apos;s reign. He was succeeded by his son Lan Kham Deng.
