Colonel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sanford C. &amp;apos;Sandy&amp;apos; Faulkner&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1806–1874) was an American&amp;lt;!--From where in America?--&amp;gt; teller of tall tales, fiddle player, and composer of the popular fiddle tune &amp;quot;[[The Arkansas Traveler (song)|The Arkansas Traveler]]&amp;quot;, which was the State song of [[Arkansas]] from 1949–1963.

Colonel Faulkner served in the [[Confederate Army]] during the [[American Civil War]], and was at one point placed in command of the Arsenal at [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].

The song inspired [[Edward Washburn]] to paint the painting of the same name, which later became a popular [[Currier &amp;amp; Ives]] [[lithograph]].

==Honors==
[[Faulkner County, Arkansas]] is named in honor of Sanford Faulkner.
