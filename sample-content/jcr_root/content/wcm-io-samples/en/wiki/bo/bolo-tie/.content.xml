A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;bolo tie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (sometimes &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;bola tie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;shoestring necktie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is a type of [[necktie]] consisting of a piece of cord or [[braid]]ed [[leather]] with decorative metal tips &amp;amp;ndash; [[aiguillette (ornament)|aglets (aiguillettes)]] &amp;amp;ndash; secured with an ornamental clasp or slide.

Bolos are easy to make, using attractive flat objects such as lady&amp;apos;s pins, coins, plastic netsuke reproductions, polished stones, Christmas tree ornaments, refrigerator magnets, etc. Cords of leather and cordage stock, clips and tips, called &amp;quot;findings&amp;quot; are widely available from jewelry supply firms.

==Popularity==
In the [[United States]], bolo ties are widely associated with [[Western wear]], and are generally most common in the western areas of the country.  Bolo tie slides and tips in [[silver]] have been part of [[Hopi]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], [[Zuni people|Zuni]] and [[Puebloan]] [[silversmith]]ing traditions since the mid-20th century. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Tanner, Clara Lee &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ray Manley&amp;apos;s Portraits &amp;amp; Turquoise of Southwest Indians&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Ray Manley Photography Inc.[Tucson], 1975, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 75-38328&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The bolo tie was made the official neckwear of [[Arizona]] in 1971. [[New Mexico]] passed a non-binding measure to designate the bolo as the state&amp;apos;s official neckwear in 1987. On March 13, 2007, New Mexico Gov. [[Bill Richardson]] signed into law that the bolo tie is now the state&amp;apos;s official tie.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Richardson&amp;apos;s Secret Weapon: The Bolo Tie&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://blog.washingtonpost.com/sleuth/2007/03/underdog_richardsons_secret_we.html Richardson&amp;apos;s Secret Weapon: The Bolo Tie - The Sleuth&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Also in 2007, the Bolo tie was named the official tie of Texas.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/texas/entry/bola_tie_bolo_tie/ Texas, The Lone Star State: Bola Tie (Bolo Tie)&amp;lt;!-- Bot generated title --&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Politicians and officials from [[Western United States|western]] states will often wear them, such as former [[Montana]] Governor [[Brian Schweitzer]].

In the [[United Kingdom]], bolo ties are known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;bootlace ties&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. They were popular with 1950s [[Teddy Boy (youth culture)|Teddy Boys]], who wore them with [[drape suit]]s.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Cross, Robert: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Steven Berkoff and the Theatre of Self-Performance&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Manchester University Press, ISBN 0-7190-6254-3, p. 36&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ribeiro, Aileen: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Dress and Morality&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Berg Publishers 2003, ISBN 1-85973-782-X, p. 164&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Along with other 1950s fashions, bolo ties were revived as part of the [[Rockabilly#The Rockabilly Look|Rockabilly look]] in the 1980s. The bolo tie returned as a popular fashion accessory in the fall of 1988 when male Hollywood stars would be frequently found wearing them. Chain stores like Jeans West and Merry-Go-Round sold multiple choices for all occasions.

During the 1980s and 1990s bolo ties, some elegant and expensive, were sold in Japan, Korea, and China. Some had fancy, hand-made cords and unusual tips. Sales overseas skyrocketed post-1970s; this was due to the overflow from the United States, where it had fallen out of fashion.

==Origins==
Silversmith Victor Cedarstaff of [[Wickenburg, Arizona]], claims to have invented the bolo tie in the late 1940s, and later [[patent]]ed&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;U.S. Patent number 896217, filed May 24, 1954, issued July 28, 1959, to Victor Emmanual Cedarstaff, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=OBQCAAAAEBAJ&amp;amp;dq=cedarstaff online at Google Patents]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; his slide design.

According to an article in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Sunset (magazine)|Sunset]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;:

{{blockquote|Victor Cedarstaff was riding his horse one day when his hat blew off. Wary of losing the silver-trimmed hatband, he slipped it around his neck. His companion joked, &amp;quot;That&amp;apos;s a nice-looking tie you&amp;apos;re wearing, Vic.&amp;quot; An idea incubated, and Cedarstaff soon fashioned the first bola tie (the name is derived from &amp;apos;&amp;apos;boleadora&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, an Argentine lariat).&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Cool under the collar: Arizona&amp;apos;s bola ties&amp;quot; by Lawrence W. Cheek, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Sunset&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, April 2002&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;}}

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boleadoras&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or [[bolas]] (from [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;bola&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;quot;ball&amp;quot;) are throwing weapons made of weights attached to the end of cords.

It is also said that the bolo tie is a North American pioneer creation that dates back to between 1866 and 1886. There is a bolo tie on display at a trading post in [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico]], said to date back that far.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}
