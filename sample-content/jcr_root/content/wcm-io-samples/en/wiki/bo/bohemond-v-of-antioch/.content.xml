&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bohemond V of Antioch&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1199âˆ’1252)&amp;lt;ref name=runciman-278&amp;gt;Runciman, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;History of the Crusades&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, vol. III, p. 278&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; was ruler of the [[Principality of Antioch]], a [[crusader state]], from 1233 to his death. He was simultaneously [[Count of Tripoli]].

Bohemond V was the son of [[Bohemund IV of Antioch]] and [[Plaisance of Gibelet]]. Like his father before him, Bohemond had a notorious dislike for the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and the neighbouring [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Kingdom of Armenia]], preferring an alliance with the [[Knights Templar]]. Peace with Armenia was assured only shortly before his death, with the mediation of [[Louis IX of France]].

In 1225, Bohemond was married to Princess [[Alice of Cyprus|Adela]] (also known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Alice of Jerusalem&amp;apos;&amp;apos;),&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web

}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Queen Dowager of [[Cyprus]] and [[Jerusalem]], whom he divorced and had the marriage annulled after July 5, 1227, most likely in 1229, without issue. His second marriage was in 1235 to Luciana (Lucienne) di Segni, a great-niece of [[Pope Innocent III]]. He had two children:
* [[Plaisance of Antioch]], a daughter who became the third wife of King [[Henry I of Cyprus]] in 1251&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Runciman, p. 278. &amp;quot;Bohemond V died in January 1252, leaving two children, a daughter, Plaisance, who had married a few months before, as his third wife, the childless King Henry of Cyprus.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
* [[Bohemond VI of Antioch]]

Bohemond V died in January 1252.  Since his son and successor was only 15 at the time, he succeeded under the regency of the [[Dowager Princess]], Luciana. However, Luciana never left [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], and instead handed over the government of the principality to her Roman relatives.  This made her unpopular, so the young Bohemond VI gained the approval of King [[Louis IX of France]], who was on Crusade at the time, to get permission from Pope [[Innocent IV]] to come of age a few months early.&amp;lt;ref name=runciman-278/&amp;gt;
