&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bofors&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a Swedish company. The name has been associated with the [[iron industry]] for more than 350 years.

Located in [[Karlskoga]], [[Sweden]], the company originates from the hammering trip [[trip hammer|hammer mill]] &amp;quot;Boofors&amp;quot; founded 1646. The modern corporate structure was created in 1873 with the foundation of [[Aktiebolag]]et (AB) Bofors-Gullspång. A leading Swedish steel producer by the early 1870s, Bofors expanded into weapons manufacture when steel produced via the [[Siemens-Martin process]] began to be used for gun manufacture. The company&amp;apos;s first [[cannon]] workshop was opened in 1884. Bofors&amp;apos; most famous owner was [[Alfred Nobel]], who owned the company from 1894 until his death in December 1896.  Nobel played the key role in reshaping the former iron and steel producer to a modern cannon manufacturer and [[chemical industry]] participant. The powder manufacturer AB Bofors Nobelkrut, later an explosives and general organic-chemical producer, was created in 1898 as a wholly owned subsidiary. By 1911 AB Bofors-Gullspång had outcompeted, bought and closed down its [[Finspång]] Swedish competitor in cannon manufacture. The company&amp;apos;s name was shortened to AB Bofors in 1919.


In 1986, a $285 million contract between the [[Government of India]] and Swedish arms company Bofors was signed for supply of 410 155mm Howitzer field guns.&amp;lt;ref name=bofors&amp;gt;{{cite news|title=25 years of India&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;Watergate&amp;apos;: The Bofors scandal|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/25-years-indias-watergate-bofors-scandal-135113721.html;_ylt=Alj5KdzFteYFGnJnR7t2kny6scB_;_ylu=X3oDMTFxbGs3Y3Z1BG1pdANJbmZpbml0ZSBCcm93c2UgVGV4dARwb3MDMQRzZWMDTWVkaWFJbmZpbml0ZUJyb3dzZUxpc3Q-;_ylg=X3oDMTNpbHR1dmhuBGludGwDaW4EbGFuZwNlbi1pbgRwc3RhaWQDODc2ZTBhMWEtMDRhMi0zMGUyLTllYmQtMDNkZjFmZDEyZDQ0BHBzdGNhdANob21lfGdvdmVybm1lbnR2c3RlYW1hbm5hBHB0A3N0b3J5cGFnZQR0ZXN0Aw--;_ylv=3|newspaper=Yahoo! News}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 1987, Swedish Radio alleged that Bofors paid [[Kickback (bribery)|illegal commissions]] to top Indian politicians and key defence officials to seal the deal.&amp;lt;ref name=bofors/&amp;gt; The scandal contributed to the defeat of Rajiv Gandhi in elections three years later.

In 1999 [[Saab AB]] purchased the [[Celsius Group]], then the parent company for Bofors. In September 2000 [[United Defense|United Defense Industries]] (UDI) of the [[United States]] acquired Bofors Weapons Systems (the heavy weapons division), while Saab retained the missile interests.

[[BAE Systems]] acquired acquired United Defense and its Bofors subsidiary in 2005, and BAE Systems Bofors is now a business unit of [[BAE Systems AB]], [[Saab Bofors Dynamics]] is a unit of [[Saab AB]]

The name Bofors is strongly associated with [[Bofors 40 mm gun|the 40 mm anti-aircraft gun]] used by both sides during [[World War II]]. This automatic cannon is often simply called the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bofors gun&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and saw service on both land and sea.  It became so widely known that anti-aircraft guns in general were often referred to as Bofors guns. Another well-known gun made by the company was the [[Bofors 37 mm anti-tank gun]], a standard anti-tank weapon used by a variety of armies early in the war. It was built under license in [[Poland]] and the [[United States|USA]] and was also used in a variety of tanks, including the [[7TP]] and [[Stuart tank|M3A3 Stuart]].
