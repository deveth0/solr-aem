&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bodhmall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bodmall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]]&amp;apos;s childhood caretakers in the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]]. She is a [[druid]]ess and the sister of Fionn&amp;apos;s father [[Cumhal]], and both she and her associate [[Liath Luachra]] are known as great warriors.

Bodhmall&amp;apos;s story appears in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. When Cumhal is slain by [[Goll mac Morna]], his wife [[Muirne]] fears for their son&amp;apos;s safety. Bodhmall and Liath Luachra come to her, and take the boy to be raised in the forest of [[Slieve Bloom Mountains|Sliabh Bladhma]]. There they teach him to hunt, and accompany him on some of his early adventures. When he grows up and news of his exploits spreads, the warrior women fear he will attract the attention of Goll&amp;apos;s men. They send him out to find his own way, having taught him all they know.
