The [[gilding|gilded]] [[bronze]] [[statue]] of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Matthew Boulton]], [[James Watt]] and [[William Murdoch]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[William Bloye]] and [[Raymond Forbes-Kings]] stands on a [[plinth]] of [[Portland stone]], outside the old Register Office on [[Broad Street, Birmingham|Broad Street]] in [[Birmingham]], [[England]].

It is known locally as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Golden Boys&amp;apos;&amp;apos; after its colour, or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Carpet Salesmen&amp;apos;&amp;apos; after the partially rolled-up plan of a steam engine which they are examining. They were most famous for improving and developing the steam engine.

Sponsored by an £8,000 bequest from Richard Wheatley in 1939, and £7,500 from the City Council, it was unveiled in 1956, from preliminary designs drawn up in 1938.

The statue was restored and re-gilded, and replaced in its old position in September 2006.

It is planned to be relocated; suggested sites including &amp;apos;across the road&amp;apos; in [[Centenary Square, Birmingham|Centenary Square]] or at [[Millennium Point (Birmingham)|Millennium Point]] in [[Eastside, Birmingham|Eastside]][http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19980812/ai_n14172213].
