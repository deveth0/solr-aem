The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Book of Mulling&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or less commonly, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Book of Moling&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Dublin, [[Trinity College Library]] MS 60 (A. I. 15)), is an Irish pocket [[Gospel Book]] from the late 8th century. The text collection includes the four Gospels, a liturgical service which includes the &amp;quot;[[Apostles&amp;apos; Creed]]&amp;quot;, and in the colophon, a supposed plan of St. Moling&amp;apos;s monastery enclosed by two concentric circles.

The name derives from a former notion that the scribe was the Leinster saint [[Saint Moling|St. Moling]] (d. 697), founder of Tech-Moling ([[St. Mullins]], Co. Carlow), whose subscription occurs in the colophon at the end of St John&amp;apos;s Gospel: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[N]omen scriptoris Mulling dicitur&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. However, the manuscript is younger and the script reveals that three scribes were involved: one for the prefaces, another for the [[synoptic gospels]] (Matthew, Mark and Luke) and a third for [[St John&amp;apos;s Gospel]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;William O&amp;apos;Sullivan, &amp;quot;Manuscripts and Palaeography.&amp;quot; In &amp;apos;&amp;apos;A New History of Ireland vol 1. Prehistoric and Early Ireland&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, ed. Dáibhí Ó Cróinín. Oxford, 2005. 535&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; It remains possible that the manuscript was copied from an autograph manuscript of St Moling.

The script is a fine Irish [[Cursive|minuscule]]. This is in fact one of the latest surviving documents to use the high style in [[Illuminated manuscripts]].  The decoration includes illuminated initials and three surviving Evangelist portraits: those of Matthew, Mark and John. Its jewelled shrine (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;cumdach&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) is also preserved at Trinity College.
