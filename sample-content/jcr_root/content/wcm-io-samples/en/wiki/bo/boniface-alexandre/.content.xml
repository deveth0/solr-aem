&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boniface Alexandre&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (born 31 July 1936) is a [[Haïti]]an politician . He served as [[acting (law)|acting]] president of Haïti from 2004 to 2006. The [[2004 Haitian coup d&amp;apos;état]] removed President [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] from the [[Americas]] on February 29, 2004. Following this, Alexandre, as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and therefore next in the presidential [[line of succession]], assumed the office of president. During Alexandre&amp;apos;s acting presidency, [[Amnesty International]] reported &amp;quot;excessive use of force by police officers&amp;quot;, [[extrajudicial execution]]s, a lack of investigations into these, escalation of &amp;quot;unlawful killings and kidnappings by illegal armed groups&amp;quot;, failure of officials to prevent and punish violence against women, dysfunctionality of the justice system, and forty or more people [[habeas corpus|imprisoned without charge or trial]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;amnesty_haitiduring2005&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =2006 Annual Report for Haiti| work =| publisher =[[Amnesty International]]| year =2006| url =http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport.php?id=ar&amp;amp;yr=2006&amp;amp;c=HTI|format =| doi =| accessdate =2009-08-06 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ipoupJCq |archivedate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=no}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Alexandre left office on May 14, 2006, when [[René Préval]], winner of the [[Haïtian elections, 2006|February 2006 presidential election]], was sworn in as president.

He is a nephew of the country&amp;apos;s first prime minister, [[Martial Célestin]].
