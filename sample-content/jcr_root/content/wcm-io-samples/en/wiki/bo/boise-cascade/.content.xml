== Boise Cascade Corporation ==

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boise Cascade Corporation&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, was established in 1957 as the result of the [[merger]] between Boise-Payette Lumber Company of [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] and the Cascade Lumber Company of [[Yakima, Washington]].

Boise-Payette was established in 1913 from a merger of the Payette Lumber &amp;amp; Manufacturing Company and Barber Lumber, a [[Wisconsin]] company with operations in the Boise Basin. Payette Lumber, a [[Minnesota]] firm, acquired 33,000 acres (130&amp;amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) of state timber in Idaho&amp;apos;s Long Valley near present-day [[Cascade, Idaho|Cascade]] in 1902. To control the passage of logs downstream, the company built a large splash dam below Smith&amp;apos;s Ferry on the North Fork of the [[Payette River]]. Logs were sent downstream to [[sawmill]]s in the town of [[Payette, Idaho|Payette]].

In the 1960s, Boise Cascade acquired a majority interest in the Cuban Electric Co., the primary electric utility in pre-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] [[Cuba]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news

In November 2004, the corporation completed its sale of its paper, building products, and timberland assets to [[Madison Dearborn]], a [[private equity]] investment firm. Boise Cascade Corporation then renamed itself [[OfficeMax]], which it had acquired in 2003. In February 2008, the company spun off its paper and packaging operations to a new company, Boise Inc., with Boise Cascade resuming use of its old name. The company went public again in 2013.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/boise-cascade-prices-ipo-above-expectations-2013-02-05 Boise Cascade prices IPO above expectations]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

== Aldabra 2 Acquisition Corp. ==

In September 2007, Madison Dearborn Partners sold the paper and packaging assets of the company to Aldabra 2 Acquisition Corp. The company is based in New York, NY. Aldabra 2 Acquisition Corp., started by investors Nathan Leight and Jason Weiss of New York-based Terrapin Partners, agreed to pay $1.34 billion in cash and the rest in shares to take over the unit. Madison Dearborn kept Boise Cascade&amp;apos;s remaining wood products and building materials divisions. The new company created by the sale is named Boise Paper Holdings, L.L.C.

Boise Paper Holdings, L.L.C. is headquartered in downtown [[Boise, Idaho]]. The company is run by Alexander Toeldte, formerly Boise Cascade&amp;apos;s executive vice president in charge of the paper, packaging and newsprint businesses.

The company is not affiliated with the [[Canada|Canadian]] paper company [[Cascades (company)|Cascades]].
