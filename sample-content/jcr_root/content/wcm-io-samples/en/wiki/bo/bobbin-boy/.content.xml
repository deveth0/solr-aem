[[File:Tony Soccha, a young bobbin boy, been working there a year. Chicopee, Mass. - NARA - 523488.jpg|thumb|A bobbin boy in 1911]]
A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;bobbin boy&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a boy who worked in a [[textile mill]] in the 18th and early 19th centuries. He would bring [[bobbin]]s to the women at the looms when they called for them, and collected the full bobbins of spun [[cotton]] or [[wool]] thread.  They also would be expected to fix minor problems with the [[machines]].  Average [[Salary|pay]] was about $1.00 a week, with days often beginning at 5:30 am and ending around 7:30 pm six days a week. One example of rising from this job to great heights in America was young Andrew Carnegie, who at age 13 worked as a bobbin boy in 1848.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Carnegie&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=RekoAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;amp;dq=Carnegie+knows+the+presid... Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie] p. 34&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
