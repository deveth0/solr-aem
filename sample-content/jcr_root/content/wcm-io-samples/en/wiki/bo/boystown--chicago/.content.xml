&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boystown&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the name of a district within [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]] situated within the [[neighborhood]] of [[Lakeview, Chicago|Lakeview]].&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Keating2008&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|author=Ann Durkin Keating|title=Chicago Neighborhoods and Suburbs: Chicago: The Unique Guidebook to Chicago&amp;apos;s Hidden Sites, Sounds &amp;amp; Tastes|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=klitA4MCY98C&amp;amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=1 August 2012|date=1 May 2002|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-493-1|pages=50â€“52}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;ZimmermanDunford2008&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite book|author1=Karla Zimmerman|author2=Lisa Dunford|author3=Nate Cavalieri|title=Chicago: City Guide|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TDd6Vfsz6XAC&amp;amp;pg=PA81|accessdate=1 August 2012|date=20 May 2008|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-767-7|pages=81}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The district&amp;apos;s informal boundaries are Irving Park Road on the north, Broadway on the east, Wellington Avenue on the south, and Sheffield Avenue on the west. Boystown lies just south of the Wrigleyville district, another popular district within the Lakeview neighborhood. Boystown has carved a niche all its own within the urban fabric of Chicago. It&amp;apos;s Chicago&amp;apos;s main [[Gay village|gay neighborhood]] home to [[LGBT]] organizations such as Equality Illinois and The Center on Halsted and is home to the annual Gay Pride Parade.

Boystown is known for its colorful, lively nightlife and inviting atmosphere. Bars close at either 2 or 4 a.m. on weekdays and Sundays (depending on the bar), and many are open until 5 a.m. Saturday night/Sunday morning. Boystown also includes some of Chicago&amp;apos;s Off-Loop Theater, specialty restaurants, greystone and brownstone walk-up buildings and other historic architecture, trendy fashion outlets, wine boutiques, chain stores and independent shops. Many of these stores and businesses line the streets of Halsted, Belmont, Broadway, Clark and Sheffield.

Public transportation in Boystown is provided by the CTA&amp;apos;s rapid transit train line with stations at [[Belmont (CTA Red Line)|Belmont]], [[Addison (CTA Red Line)|Addison]], and [[Sheridan (CTA station)|Sheridan]] on the Red Line, and [[Belmont (CTA Brown Line)|Belmont]] and [[Wellington (CTA station)|Wellington]] on the Brown Line. Numerous CTA bus routes also serve the district, as well as taxicabs.

North Halsted Street is the main street of this bustling district. City planners have designated North Halsted an official pedestrian and bike route following a 1998 community project that resulted in the erection of 11 pairs of rainbow-colored abstract Art Deco pylons along the strip. Alderman [[Thomas M. Tunney]] represents the 44th Ward on the [[Chicago City Council|city council]]; Boystown is a part of this ward.
