&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Boston Lyric Opera (BLO)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an American opera company based in Boston, Massachusetts, founded in 1976.
==Company history==
Recounted in Cowden, pp. 234 - 238

==Productions==
Each season, BLO produces three mainstage productions at the Citi Performing Arts Center Shubert Theatre in Boston and a fully staged, one-hour English language version of a popular opera for school children and families at venues throughout New England.  BLO receives partial funding from a grant from the Massachusetts Cultural Council.  BLO regularly invests in co-productions with other U.S. companies including [[New York City Opera]], the [[Opera Theatre of St. Louis]], [[Houston Grand Opera]], and [[Glimmerglass Opera]].

BLO&amp;apos;s community work has included participation in the &amp;quot;Egypt in Boston&amp;quot; thematic season that celebrated Egypt at several of Boston’s leading cultural institutions in 1999–2000.  In the summer of 2002, BLO produced &amp;quot;Carmen on the Common&amp;quot;, a community-outreach initiative of a summer-long education series which culminated in two free, fully staged outdoor performances of Bizet&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Carmen (opera)|Carmen]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on [[Boston Common]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news | author=Richard Dyer | title=Lyric Opera to bring free performances of &amp;apos;Aida&amp;apos; to the Common | url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/03/22/lyric_opera_to_bring_free_performances_of_aida_to_the_common/ | work=Boston Globe | date=2005-03-22 | accessdate=2008-11-10}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;  Similar plans were scheduled for Verdi&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Aida]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in the 2005–2006 season, but were cancelled because of insufficient financial support.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite news | author=Geoff Edgers | title=Donor shortage halts plan for free &amp;apos;Aida&amp;apos; | url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/12/20/donor_shortage_halts_plan_for_free_aida/ | work=Boston Globe | date=2005-12-20 | accessdate=2008-11-10}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
