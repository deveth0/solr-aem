&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ahmed Boughèra El Ouafi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-ar|أحمد بوغيرا العوافي}}) (October 15, 1898 &amp;amp;ndash; October 18, 1959) born in [[Setif]] was a [[France|French]] [[athletics (sport)|athlete]] during the time [[Algeria]] was part of [[France]]. In 1928, he won the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medal in the [[marathon (sports)|marathon]].

==Biography==
El Ouafi was born near the town of [[Sétif]], joining the [[France|French]] military regiment there later (at the time, Algeria was French territory). One of his superior officers noticed El Ouafi&amp;apos;s outstanding athletic abilities, and decided to send him to a military sports competition in France. He made a good impression there, and was allowed to enter qualification for the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in Paris in the marathon event.

Boughèra El Ouafi managed to qualify, and completed his first Olympic marathon, running for France, in seventh position. This good result allowed him to prepare more extensively for the [[1928 Summer Olympics|next Games]], held in [[Amsterdam]]. In the 1928 competition, he ran behind the leaders for the first three quarters of the race, overtaking them some 5 km before the end. He was never caught by any of the other runners, and finished first, 26 seconds ahead of second-placed [[Manuel Plaza]] from [[Chile]].

After his surprise victory, El Ouafi toured the [[United States]]. However, the money he earned with this trip disqualified him as an amateur, causing him to leave the sport, and he opened a cafe in [[Paris]]. El Ouafi remained forgotten until 1956, when another Algerian, [[Alain Mimoun]], also won the Olympic marathon. Reporters went to seek out the other Algerian who had won 28 years earlier, and found him a pauper.

El Ouafi was killed while in a café, three days after his 61st birthday, by members of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] after he had refused to support them.
