&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bong Load Custom Records&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[independent record label]] based in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] which was founded by producers [[Tom Rothrock]], [[Rob Schnapf]] and partner Bradshaw Lambert. One of their biggest signings was [[Beck]] in 1991. Other notable bands from the original Bong Load Custom Records include [[Fu Manchu (band)|Fu Manchu]], [[Wool (band)|Wool]], [[Kyuss]], [[Dog Society]], [[The Obsessed]], [[Fatso Jetson]] and Los Angeles Bands [[Lutefisk]] and [[Project K]]. In 2007, Rothrock relaunched the label with a series of his own solo recordings of instrumental releases.

In 1998, Beck released the album &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Mutations (Beck album)|Mutations]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; on the [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] label, which led to a series of lawsuits between Beck, Bong Load and Geffen which were settled in 1999.

Much of the Bong Load Record catalog was released in small quantities. Several bands have very rare releases that are much sought after and command high prices at auctions.
