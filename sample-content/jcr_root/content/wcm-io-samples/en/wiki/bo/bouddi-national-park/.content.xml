&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bouddi National Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is located on the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], 46&amp;amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Sydney]].&amp;lt;ref name=DistfromSyd&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/distancedraw2?rec1=39923&amp;amp;placename=bouddi&amp;amp;placetype=0&amp;amp;state=0&amp;amp;place1=SYDNEY&amp;amp;place1long=151.209595&amp;amp;place1lat=-33.873199|title=Great Circle Distance between SYDNEY and BOUDDI NATIONAL PARK|accessdate=11 August 2011|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|work=Geosciences Australia website}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; A section of the national park extends into the sea creating fully protected land, shore and marine habitats. The Park contains one of the last temperate rainforests on the Central Coast, [[Fletchers Glen]].

Bouddi National Park was originally known as &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bouddi Natural Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. It received its name at the second meeting of the park trust held on 5 July 1936. Other names considered were &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Maitland Bay Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Cape Three Points Reserve&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Gerrinbombi Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The reason for the choice was that &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bouddi&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the authenticated aboriginal name of the most conspicuous feature of the district and appears on maps as early as 1828. Bouddi is the Aboriginal word for the heart.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Bennett p17&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The trust had been founded the year earlier to manage the reserve and had representation from the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;NSW Federation of Bushwalking Clubs&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and [[Erina Shire Council]].

In 1967, the park (by then totalling about 1310 acres) was dedicated as a national park under the newly passed legislation and was renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bouddi State Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Its management became the responsibility of the [[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service]], and soon afterwards the trust was reconstituted as an advisory committee. On 1 January 1974, the National Parks and Wildlife Act dispensed with the category of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;State&amp;apos;&amp;apos; parks and Bouddi was renamed &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bouddi National Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Pratt p4&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
