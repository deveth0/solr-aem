&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, {{ussc|210|339|1908}}, was a  [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision concerning the scope of rights accorded owners of a [[copyright]].  This was a [[case of first impression]] concerning whether the [[copyright law]]s permit an owner to control a purchaser&amp;apos;s subsequent sale of a copyrighted work.  The court stated the issue as:
: &amp;quot;Does the sole right to vend (named in 4952) secure to the owner of the copyright the right, after a sale of the book to a purchaser, to restrict future sales of the book at retail, to the right to sell it at a certain price per copy, because of a notice in the book that a sale at a different price will be treated as an infringement, which notice has been brought home to one undertaking to sell for less than the named sum?&amp;quot;

The case centered around the publisher setting additional terms not specifically stated in the statute and claiming that the work was licensed and not sold.  The Court&amp;apos;s ruling established what came to be known as the &amp;quot;[[first-sale doctrine]]&amp;quot;, which was later codified as § 109(a) of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]].

==Facts==
[[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] sold a copyrighted novel, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Castaway&amp;apos;&amp;apos; by [[Hallie Erminie Rives]], with  the notice, &amp;quot;The price of this book at retail is $1 net. No dealer is licensed to sell it at a lower price, and a sale at a lower price will be treated as an infringement of the copyright&amp;quot; printed immediately below the copyright notice.  The defendants, [[Macy&amp;apos;s|R.H. Macy &amp;amp; Co.]], purchased large lots of books at wholesale and sold copies of the book at retail at the price of 89 cents a copy.

==Holding==
The court held first that the copyright statutes protect an owner&amp;apos;s right to &amp;quot;multiply and sell&amp;quot; the work on their own terms.  The [[statutory right]] to sell, however, did not also create a right to limit resale.

The court did not hold that a [[contract]] or [[license]] imposed on the first sale could not create an obligation.  In this case, there was no contract between the owner and the original purchaser, and there was not [[privity of contract]] between the owner and any third party.
