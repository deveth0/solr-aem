&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xiaochangliang&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|s=小长梁|t=小長梁|p=xiǎochángliáng}}) is the site of some of the earliest [[paleolithic]] remains in [[East Asia]], located in the Nihewan Basin in [[Yangyuan County]], [[Hebei]], [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China|China]], most famous for the [[stone tools]] discovered there.

==Stone Tools==
The tool forms discovered include [[Scraper (archaeology)|side and end scrapers]], notches, [[burins]], and disc cores. Although it is generally more difficult to date Asian sites than [[African]] sites because Asian sites typically lack volcanic materials that can be dated isotropically, the age of the tools has been [[stratigraphy|magnetostratigraphically]] dated as 1.36 million years. This method hinges upon dated reversals in the earth&amp;apos;s magnetic field.

==Research==
The site was first discovered by the US geologist [[George Barbour (geologist)|George Barbour]] in 1923.  Barbour invited [[France|French]] archaeologists [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] and [[Pere Licent]].  In 1935 de Chardin found a stone (flint) tool and deternimined the age of the site to be over a million years - it was the oldest artefact then known. Many scientists, including de Chardin, debated whether this tool might not be naturally formed.

The discovery by [[Pei Wenzhong]] of [[Peking Man]] hundreds of kilometers to the south (followed by wars and revolution) distracted the attention of the world&amp;apos;s scientific community.  However, from 1972-1978 more than 2000 pieces of stone tools were discovered, together with some bone tools, which confirmed Xiaochangliang (or [[Nihewan]]) as a paleolithic site.

In 1982, [[Wei Qi]], then 44, found a huge hominid settlement at [[Donggutuo Village]].  He took samples to Pei, whose Peking Man was not half as old. &amp;quot;He said nothing,&amp;quot; said Wei. &amp;quot;But I guess he had accepted it.&amp;quot;  Pei died of a heart attack a few days later.
