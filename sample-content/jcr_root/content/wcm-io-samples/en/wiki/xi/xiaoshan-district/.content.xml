&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xiaoshan District&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|s=萧山区|t=蕭山區|p=Xiāoshān Qū}}), a district of the city of [[Hangzhou]], located in [[Zhejiang]] province in [[China]]. Xiaoshan was formerly a city in its own right, across the [[Qiantang River]] from the older parts of Hangzhou, but was absorbed in recent years by its much larger neighbor and made into an administrative district of Hangzhou.

Hangzhou&amp;apos;s international airport, [[Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport]], is located here. The area is also at the center of one of China&amp;apos;s local real estate booms, as the  demand for newer, more upscale housing by China&amp;apos;s growing middle and upper classes has led to an explosion in construction of new high-rise residential towers and Western-style condominium developments in Xiaoshan. It is also the site of [[Hangzhou Xiaoshan Sports Centre]].
