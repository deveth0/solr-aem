The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ximenez-Fatio House&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a historic property used as a [[boarding house]] in the [[Florida Territory]] period. The museum is located at 20 Aviles Street in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], [[Florida]]. It is owned and operated by the [[National Society of the Colonial Dames of America]] in the State of Florida. On July 25, 1973, it was added to the [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The Ximenez-Fatio House Museum is one of St. Augustine&amp;apos;s oldest historic properties.  The museum complex is located on Aviles Street, America&amp;apos;s first platted thoroughfare, in the center of the city&amp;apos;s oldest community, the Old Town area south of the Plaza. The property includes a ca. 1798 &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[coquina]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; stone House, the region&amp;apos;s only detached coquina kitchen building, and a reconstructed ca. 1802 wash house.

The house stands as one of the best preserved of the three dozen colonial buildings remaining in St. Augustine.  The historic grounds of the museum date to St. Augustine&amp;apos;s original town plan of 1572.  Meticulous restoration and furnishings of period decorative arts and historical objects provide the setting for authentic portrayals of territorial life and early statehood in St. Augustine. The museum interprets the property&amp;apos;s role as a [[boarding house]], representing one of the few socially acceptable business ventures for a 19th-century woman.

The museum is open to the public Tuesday through Saturday 11:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M.  Tour groups are welcome and the facilities are available for private events.
