{{Unreferenced|date=December 2008}}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xiong Qinglai&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|t=熊慶來|s=熊庆来|p=Xióng Qìnglái|w=&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hsiung Ch&amp;apos;ing-lai&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}, October 20, 1893—February 3, 1969), [[courtesy name]] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Youzhi&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (迪之), was a [[China|Chinese]] [[mathematician]] from [[Yunnan]]. He was the first person to introduce modern mathematics into China, and served as an influential president of [[Yunnan University]] from 1937 through 1947. A Chinese stamp was issued in his honour.

==Biography==
Xiong studied in Europe for eight years (1913 to 1921) before returning to China to teach. During that time, Chinese university-level mathematics was only comparable to Western secondary-school mathematics level. In 1921, he established the Department of Mathematics of [[National Southeastern University]] (Later renamed [[National Central University]] and [[Nanjing University]]), beginning undertook the task of writing more than ten textbooks on [[geometry]], [[calculus]], [[differential equations]], [[mechanics]], etc. It was the first endeavor in history to introduce modern mathematics in Chinese textbooks. In 1926, Xiong became a professor of mathematics at [[Tsinghua University]], where he influenced the path of [[Hua Luogeng]], who later became another prominent mathematician.
