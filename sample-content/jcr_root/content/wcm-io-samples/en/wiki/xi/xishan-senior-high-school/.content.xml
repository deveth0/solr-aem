== History ==
Jiangsu Xishan Senior High School was founded in 1907 by Mr. Zhongmo Kuang, a well reputed local entrepreneur. Mr Kuang started his career in cotton yarning and expanded his business into real state and finance. He founded Kuang’s Senior High School in his home town, the Yong’s Villa, which was the predecessor of Jiangsu Xishan Senior High School. Kuang’s Senior High provided local teenagers both traditional confusianism education and modern science like math and physics.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{citation|url=http://blog.readanovel.com/article/htm/tid_940130.html|date=2007-10-10|title=百年学府省锡中：无锡基础教育界一颗闪耀的明珠|last=雪儿翩翩}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

During the World War 2, Mr. Kuang’s major possession, the Penglai Market in Shanghai downtown, was destroyed by Japanese army, and the Kuang’s Senior High was forced to close down until 1952, 3 years after the China Civil War. In 1952, the local Wuxi government wanted to rebuild Kuang’s Senior High School, both the campus and the great reputation of the Kuang’s education. The Kuang’s Senior High School was renamed as the Senior High of Wuxi County. In 1996, it is renamed again as Jiangsu Xishan Senior High School, and became a public high school run by the Jiangsu Province Government.

Now, Jiangsu Xishan Senior High School has 3 campuses, Yanqiao Campus (main campus), Yang’s Villa Campus (old campus), Dongting Campus. In the main campus, there are 3 classroom buildings, 1 lab building, 1 library building, 1 administration building, 1 art building, 1 gym, 1 ground track field, 32 basketball courts, 10 dorm buildings, 2 student cafeterias.
