&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xiang Chong&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a fictional character in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Water Margin]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, one of the [[Four Great Classical Novels]] of [[Chinese literature]]. He ranks 64th of the 108 Liangshan heroes and 28th of the 72 Earthly Fiends. He is nicknamed &amp;quot;Eight-armed Nezha&amp;quot;.

==Background==
Xiang Chong wears a steel helmet and carries a shield with a beast&amp;apos;s head engraved on it. He wields an iron [[Qiang (spear)|spear]] and 24 flying daggers for hurling at enemies. He excels in martial arts and can hit a target a hundred steps away accurately with his daggers. He also walks at a lightning speed. He is nicknamed &amp;quot;Eight-armed [[Nezha (deity)|Nezha]]&amp;quot; after the warrior deity.

==Joining Liangshan==
Xiang Chong is from [[Pei County]], [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]. He is a close friend of [[Fan Rui]] and [[Li Gun]]. The three of them form an army of 3,000 bandits under their command on the nearby Mount Mangdang. They proclaim that they will conquer [[Mount Liang|Liangshan Marsh]] one day, provoking the outlaws from Liangshan to attack them. [[Shi Jin]] volunteers to lead the vanguard army and he faces Xiang Chong in combat but is defeated by Xiang.

The next day, [[Gongsun Sheng]] deploys the Liangshan troops in the [[Eight Trigrams Formation]] to counter Fan Rui. Fan Rui uses magic to darken the sky and conjure a sandstorm to throw the enemy into confusion. Meanwhile, Xiang Chong and Li Gun lead their men to attack and break the enemy formation. Gongsun Sheng defeats Fan Rui in a battle of magic and both Xiang Chong and Li Gun are lost in the formation and captured. [[Song Jiang]] treats the captives with respect and succeed in persuading them to join the Liangshan cause of &amp;quot;delivering justice on Heaven&amp;apos;s behalf&amp;quot;. Xiang Chong and Li Gun are touched and they return to Mount Mangdang and succeed in persuading Fan Rui to join Liangshan as well.

==Campaigns and death==
Xiang Chong becomes one of the leaders of the Liangshan infantry after the Grand Assembly. He follows the heroes on their campaigns against the [[Liao Dynasty|Liao]] invaders and rebel forces after they have been granted amnesty by the [[Emperor Huizong of Song|emperor]]. During the [[Fang La]] campaign, Xiang Chong is assigned to attack the enemy city of Muzhou. He faces the enemy general [[Zheng Biao]] in battle. Zheng Biao uses his [[lasso]] to trip Xiang Chong and Xiang is killed by enemy soldiers after he is down.
