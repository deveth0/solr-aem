&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xia Yan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (夏衍)(30 October 1900 - 6 February 1995) was a Chinese playwright and screenwriter.

Xia entered Zhejiang Industrial School (浙江甲種工業學校, a technical school of [[Zhejiang University]]) in 1915 [http://www.zju.edu.cn/~piclib/fazhan/tuku/rw02.htm].

Amongst the dozens of plays and screenplays penned by Xia Yen, the most renowned works include &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Under the Eaves of Shanghai&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1937) and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Fascist Bacillus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1944). He rose to the position of vice-minister for culture by the 1960s but later spent eight years in prison following the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Today the Xia Yan Film Literature Awards are named in his honour.
