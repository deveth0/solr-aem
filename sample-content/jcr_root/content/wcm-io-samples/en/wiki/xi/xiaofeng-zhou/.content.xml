        text="&lt;p&gt;Dr. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xiaofeng Zhou,&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Associate Professor, Center for [[Molecular Biology]] of Oral Diseases, [[University of Illinois at Chicago College of Dentistry]], is an internationally known [[oral cancer]] researcher.

His primary research interest is to utilize [[molecular genetics]] and bioninformatics technologies to develop novel diagnostic tools and to gain a better understanding of human diseases such as head and neck/oral cancer. His  research is focused on the genetic mapping of disease genes and/or consistent genomic alterations that are associated with the development and progression of oral cancer.

Dr. Zhou previously had been an Assistant Professor of Oral Biology at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) School of Dentistry, and also was a member of UCLA’s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center and the university’s Dental Research Institute. He holds a BS in [[biochemistry]] and [[microbiology]] from [[Hangzhou University]] in China; a PhD in biochemistry and a postdoctorate training in human genetics from [[Boston University]]; and an MS in [[software engineering]] from [[Brandeis University]].

Dr. Zhou has published more than 40 journal articles, review articles, and book chapters, and holds three [[National Institutes of Health]] grant research projects.

Dr. Zhou is also a Visiting Professor at Sun Yat-sen University, China.
