        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;XIX Corps&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[corps]] of the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].  It spent most of its service in [[Louisiana]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]], though several units fought in [[Virginia]]&amp;apos;s [[Shenandoah Valley]].

XIX Corps was created on December 14, 1862, and assigned to [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Nathaniel P. Banks]], the commander of the [[Department of the Gulf]].  The corps comprised all Union troops then occupying Louisiana and [[east Texas]].  It originally consisted of four [[division (military)|divisions]], numbering 36,000 men.

==Port Hudson==
In April 1863, the corps was involved in the actions at [[Battle of Fort Bisland | Fort Bisland]] and [[Battle of Irish Bend | Irish Bend]]. It operated the [[Siege of Port Hudson]] from April 27&amp;amp;ndash;July 9, 1863, the fall of which, along with that of [[Siege of Vicksburg | Vicksburg, Mississippi]], closed off the [[Mississippi River]] to Confederate shipping.  XIX Corps also gained measure of distinction for being the first Federal unit to use a large number of [[U.S. Colored Troops|colored troops]] in action, particularly against Port Hudson, with Banks giving them due credit for their valiant contributions to the siege.

==Red River Campaign==
In spring of 1864, the corps took part in Banks&amp;apos; disastrous [[Red River Campaign]], under the command of [[William B. Franklin]], who was wounded at [[Battle of Mansfield | Mansfield]].  After its conspicuous role in the failure, two divisions under [[William H. Emory]] were sent to Virginia to join [[Phillip Sheridan]]&amp;apos;s operations in the Shenandoah Valley against [[Jubal Early]] (see [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]). These troops took part in all of the major engagements of Sheridan&amp;apos;s campaign, most notably at [[Battle of Opequon | Opequon]], where they lost some 2,000 men killed or wounded (mostly in [[Cuvier Grover]]&amp;apos;s division).

==Georgia==
After this, the corps was sent [[Savannah, Georgia]], where it remained until the end of the war. The XIX Corps was officially disbanded on March 26, 1865, but the corps took part in the [[Grand Review]] in Washington, and some of its units remained in Savannah and Louisiana until 1866.
