&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xingu peoples&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are [[indigenous peoples of Brazil]] living near the [[Xingu River]]. They have many cultural similarities despite their different ethnologies. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xingu&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; people represent fifteen tribes and all four of Brazil&amp;apos;s indigenous language groups, but they share similar belief systems, rituals and ceremonies.

==Precolumbian history==
The Upper Xingu region was heavily populated prior to European and African contact. Densely populated settlements developed from 1200 to 1600 CE.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Hackenberger, Michael J. et al. [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/301/5640/1710.abstract?siteid=sci&amp;amp;ijkey=LJeCeuYlCQLBY&amp;amp;keytype=ref &amp;quot;Amazonia 1492: Pristine Forest or Cultural Parkland?&amp;quot;] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Science Magazine.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 25 July 2003 (retrieved 25 June 2011)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Ancient roads and bridges linked communities were often surrounded by ditches or moats. The villages were pre-planned and featured circular plazas. Archaeologists have unearthed 19 villages so far.&amp;lt;ref name=wren&amp;gt;Wren, Kathleen. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3077413/ &amp;quot;Lost cities of the Amazon revealed.&amp;quot;] &amp;apos;&amp;apos;MSNBC: Science Mysteries.&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (retrieved 25 June 2011)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

==Post-contact history==
[[Kuikuro]] oral history says European [[slaver]]s arrived in the Xingu region around 1750. Xinuguano population was estimated in the tens of thousands but was dramatically reduced by diseases and slavery by Europeans.&amp;lt;ref name=wren/&amp;gt; In the centuries since the penetration of the Europeans into South America, the Xingu fled from different regions to escape modernization and cultural assimilation. Nonetheless settlers made it up as far as the upper run of the Rio Xingu. By the end of the 19th century, about 3,000 natives lived at the Alto Xingu, where their current political status has kept them protected against European intruders. By the mid twentieth century this number had been reduced by foreign epidemic diseases such as flu, measles, smallpox and malaria to less than 1,000. Only an estimated 500 Xingu peoples were alive in the 1950s.&amp;lt;ref name=wren/&amp;gt;

The Brazilian [[Villas-Bôas brothers]] visited the area beginning in 1946 and pushed for creating the [[Xingu National Park|Parque Indígena do Xingu]] which was established in 1961. The number of Xingu living here in 32 settlements has risen again to today over 3000 inhabitants, half of them younger than 15 years.

The Xingu living in this region have similar habits and social systems, despite different languages. Specifically, they consist of the following peoples: the [[Aweti]], [[Kalapalo]], [[Kamaiurá]], [[Kayapó]], [[Kuikuro]], [[Matipu]], [[Mehinako]], [[Nahukuá]], [[Suyá]], [[Trumai people|Trumai]], [[Wauja]] and [[Yawalapiti]].
