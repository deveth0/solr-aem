&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xia Nai&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hsia Nai&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; {{zh|c=夏鼐|p=Xià Nài|w=Hsia Nai}}; (1910–1985) was born in [[Wenzhou]], southern [[Zhejiang]], [[China]]) was a Chinese archaeologist.  He majored in economic history at the elite [[Tsinghua University]] in Beijing (BA, 1934), winning a scholarship to study abroad.  He went to [[University College London]] and studied Egyptology earning a doctorate that was finally awarded to him in 1946.  In the meantime, he had returned to China joining the staff of the Central Museum and then in 1944 joining the Department of Archaeology of the Institute of History and Philology, Academia Sinica (1943-1949), becoming acting director in 1948.  When the Institute moved to Taiwan in 1949, Xia stayed behind in China, teaching at [[Zhejiang University]] for a year before joining  the Chinese Academy of Sciences, eventually becoming director of its Institute of Archaeology (1962-1982). Before his death, he was First Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Thanks to his contributions to Chinese and world archaeology, he was one of the most honoured Chinese scholars in academe, receiving memberships from the British Academy (1974), the Swedish Royal Academy of Letters, History, and Antiquities (1983), and the U.S. Academy of Sciences (1984), among others.
