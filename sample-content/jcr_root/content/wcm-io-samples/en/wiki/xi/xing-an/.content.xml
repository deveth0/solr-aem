&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xing&amp;apos;an&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|t=興安省|p=Xīng&amp;apos;ān shěng}}) or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hsingan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; refers to a former province, which once occupied western [[Heilongjiang]] and part of northwest [[Jilin]] provinces of China. The name is related to that of the [[Greater Khingan]] Mountains. Another name used for this land was &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Barga&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which is also the name used for the eastern part of the province, the Barga district.

==Administration==
The capital of Hsingan was the town of [[Hailar, China|Hailar]] (or Hulun), on the [[China Eastern Railway]] line near the [[Russia]]n border. Hsingan was divided into various sub-prefectures, similar in form to other Manchukuo provinces. The second city of importance was [[Manzhouli]].

== History ==

Hsingan &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[anto (country subdivision)|anto]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (province) was first created in 1932 as an administrative sub-division of the Japanese-controlled Empire of [[Manchukuo]]. From 1939 to 1943, the province was divided into four parts, labeled &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hsingan North&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hsingan East&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hsingan South&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hsingan West&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. These four provinces were reunited into a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Xing&amp;apos;an Consolidated Province&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (興安総省) in 1943. Hsingan at {{convert|148000|sqmi|km2}} encompassed nearly one third of the land area of Manchukuo.

The population of Hsingan, estimated at 965,000 in 1935, was predominantly ethnically [[Mongol]], and Hsingan was therefore administered by a local Mongol prince (under supervision of a Japanese [[Resident Commissioner|resident]] supervisor).

Hsingan was the site of a number of clashes in the [[Soviet-Japanese Border Wars]], most notably the [[Nomonhan Incident]] where Japanese [[Kwantung Army]] and [[Manchukuo Imperial Army]] forces were defeated by the [[Soviet Red Army]] in 1939.

After the annexation of Manchukuo by the [[Republic of China]] after the end of [[World War II]], the [[Kuomintang]] continued to recognize the area as Hsingan Province, with the capital in [[Hailar, China|Hailar]]. However, under the administration of the [[People&amp;apos;s Republic of China]] from 1949, the area was annexed to the [[Inner Mongolia|Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]], and is now referred to as the [[Hulunbuir]] [[Prefecture-level city]]. The population is now estimated to be over 80% ethnic [[Han Chinese]].

==Economy==
Under the Manchukuo period, Hsingan was primarily an agricultural area, with food grains, particularly wheat, soy and corn, as well as cattle, sheep, horse and other livestock. The primary economic asset of Hsingan was its extensive [[coal]] deposits, primarily at Chalai Nor hill, 25 kilometers from the frontier station of [[Manchouli]], where 290,000 metric tonnes were extracted annually. Hsingan was also a trade zone between Manchukuo, the [[Soviet Union]], and Soviet-dominated [[Mongolia]].
