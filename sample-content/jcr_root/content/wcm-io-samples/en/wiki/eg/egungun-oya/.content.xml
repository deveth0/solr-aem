In [[Yoruba mythology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Egungun-oya&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a goddess of [[divination]]. &amp;quot;[[Egungun]]&amp;quot; refers to the collective spirits of the ancestral dead; the [[Orisha]] &amp;quot;[[Oya]]&amp;quot; is seen as the mother of the Egun.

In [[Egba]] and [[Egbado]] area, as well as many parts of [[Yorubaland]], Odun Egungun festivals are held in communities to commemorate the ancestors. Egungun masquerade are performed during these annual or biennial ceremonies as well as during specific funeral rites throughout the year. The masquerade is a multifaceted ceremony which includes the making of offerings as well as the honoring of ancestors for past and future aid.

Egungun performances organized for funerary purposes mark the death of important individuals. In this context, the [[African tribal masks|masks]] reflect a creative response to death as a time of crisis involving mourning and loss. Elaborate performances serve to commemorate the dead through the remembrance of their past life while simultaneously reinforcing the relationship between the living and the recently deceased ancestor.

Among the broad range of themes incorporated in the Egungun masks are representations of numerous societal and cultural stereotypes as well as acrobatic images in which dancers turn their clothing inside out, in part to suggest the power and distance of the ancestral world. Entertaining satirical masks depicting animals and humans are performed during the masquerade and often serve as a social commentary on the life of the community.
