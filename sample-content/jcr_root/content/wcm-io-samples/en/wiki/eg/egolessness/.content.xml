In [[psychology]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;egolessness&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is an [[emotional]] state where one feels no [[ego, super-ego, and id|ego]] (or [[self (psychology)|self]]); of having no distinct [[being]] apart from the world around oneself. From the view of Western [[psychoanalysis]] and therapy, the state of &amp;quot;oneness&amp;quot; can be either positive or negative depending on the person, and in the context in which these feelings occur in each person.

The described feeling of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;oneness&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (of being inextricably woven to the fabric of one&amp;apos;s surroundings or environment) is thought to be akin to egolessness. Lifestyles of [[communal]] ownership (no individual property) and the &amp;quot;[[vow of poverty]]&amp;quot; in many monastic traditions may also be intended to make selflessness easier to maintain; that its practitioners may continuously remain in a meditative state of mind.

In some forms of [[meditation]] in [[Asia]]n [[Religion in Asia|religion]]s, egolessness is a mental state that is sought after. While at the basic levels, meditation is geared toward [[relaxation technique|relaxation]], the practice of advanced meditators may be aimed toward the purpose of dividing one from their awareness of &amp;quot;self,&amp;quot; to a certain degree, and for a certain time. The ritual and religious treatment of meditation functions so that the individual learns to take the practice with seriousness; learning to gradually control their degree of relaxation such that undesired and harmful schisms do not occur to the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]].

Note that the term &amp;quot;selflessness&amp;quot; is similar in literal meaning (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;ego&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the [[Latin]] word for &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;) but differs in nuance and usage. One would describe a set of acts as &amp;quot;selfless&amp;quot; ([[wikt:altruistic|altruistic]]) when they are not selfish—when they benefit others more than oneself. One would say that a person is &amp;quot;egoless&amp;quot; when he or she feels or acts in a way that suggests that the self is irrelevant (regardless of whether the act or attitude had any benefit to self or others). In other words, &amp;quot;selfless&amp;quot; is the opposite of &amp;quot;selfish&amp;quot; while &amp;quot;egoless&amp;quot; is [[orthogonal]] to both. The closest antonyms to &amp;quot;egolessness&amp;quot; are &amp;quot;[[egotism]]&amp;quot; (a heightened sense of self-worth or one&amp;apos;s own importance) or possibly [[solipsism]].

The writer [[Aleister Crowley]] distinguished between two main types of egolessness, for which he used the [[Sanskrit]] terms [[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]] (which means &amp;quot;meditation&amp;quot;) and [[Samadhi]] (which he associated with the Nothing, or in Hebrew &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ain&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). He wrote the following about the relative difficulties of attaining them:

&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Now we do know this, that if thought is kept single and steady, Dhyana results. We do not know whether an intensification of this is sufficient to cause Samadhi, or whether some other circumstances are required. One is science, the other empiricism.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/aba/aba1.html Book 4] –Hermetic.com&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Despite this, Crowley recommended a complex system of practices from Eastern and Western sources to help people attain Samadhi.

Ego loss is commonly experienced by those under the influence of [[psychedelic drugs]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}
