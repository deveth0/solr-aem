&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Egmont National Park&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is located south of [[New Plymouth]], close to the west coast of the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]].  It is named after the mountain which dominates its environs, which itself was named by [[Captain Cook]] after [[John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont]], the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]  who promoted Cook&amp;apos;s first voyage. Taranaki has been the [[Māori language|Māori]] name for the mountain for many centuries, and the mountain itself now has two alternative official names, &amp;quot;Mount Taranaki&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Mount Egmont&amp;quot;.

The park, established in 1900, is dominated by the dormant [[volcano]] of [[Mount Taranaki]]. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://gns.cri.nz/content/download/6149/33766/file/QuickFacts%20%20MtTaranaki.pdf | title= Volcano Fact Sheet: Mount Taranaki / Egmont Volcano | publisher = GNS Science | date = 2010 |accessdate= 2012-01-10}} &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The park receives massive annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] which is essentially [[orographic]] in origin as moist westerlies moving inland from the Tasman hit Mount Taranaki and the adjacent Pouakai and Kaitake ranges and are thus forced to rise. Since the area has high annual rainfall and mild coastal climate there is a lush [[rainforest]] covering the foothills- this forest is nationally significant for the total absence of beech trees (genus [[Nothofagus]]).

==Ecology==
A rich [[Metrosideros robusta|Northern rātā]]/[[Rimu]]/[[Broadleaf]] forest is present, although the entire park [[ecosystem]] displays distinct patterns of vegetative [[zonation]] - the former two large species of tree are common at lower elevations whereas [[Kamahi]] tends to dominate the stunted high altitude forest. In these [[old growth]] forests the [[Crown Fern]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Blechnum discolor]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, is a dominant understory plant species. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=95431 | title= Crown Fern: Blechnum discolor | author = C. Michael Hogan | date = 2009 |accessdate= 2012-01-10}} &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

The character of the plant communities continues to change with increasing altitude, to [[subalpine]] and alpine [[shrubland]]s at high elevations, which are in stark contrast to the surrounding pasture farmlands. Notable among the geographical features of the park is its clear radial [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage pattern]], which can be discerned in the satellite picture at right.

The Ahukawakawa swamp is a rare high-altitude (920m) sphagnum moss wetland located between Mt Taranaki and the Pouakai range. It contains many endemic species adapted to acid soils and low temperatures.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/taranaki-region/4/3|title=Ahukawakawa Swamp}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
