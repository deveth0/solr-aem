&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Egilsay&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is one of the [[Orkney Islands]] in [[Scotland]], lying east of [[Rousay]].  The [[island]] is largely [[Farmland (farming)|farmland]] and is known for its [[corncrake]]s.

==St. Magnus Church==
Extremely unusual for the [[Northern Isles]], it has been suggested that Egilsay may have a partly Gaelic name.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Anderson, Joseph 1893&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;Smith&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; While at first sight, it appears to be Egil&amp;apos;s island, &amp;quot;Egil&amp;quot; being a Norse personal name, the Gaelic &amp;apos;&amp;apos;eaglais&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Celtic &amp;quot;eccles&amp;quot;) meaning church, may be part of the root, as the island is dominated by a church of pre-Norse foundation. The island of [[Kili Holm]] just to the north, may represent &amp;apos;&amp;apos;cille&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a monastic cell.

The church itself has a highly unusual [[Irish style round tower]], which itself is extremely rare in Scotland, and is unique in Orkney (though other examples are known to have existed in the past). The building is roofless and the tower has been slightly truncated, but it is otherwise complete.  It is maintained by [[Historic Scotland]] as an [[Ancient Monument]] and Category A [[listed building]].

Egilsay was the place where [[Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney|Saint Magnus]] was killed in 1117 by an axe blow to the head. While the church is dedicated to him, the foundation may be far older. For hundreds of years the story of St. Magnus, part of the [[Orkneyinga saga]], was considered just a legend until a skull with a large crack in it, such as it had been stricken by an axe, was found in the walls of [[St. Magnus Cathedral]] in Kirkwall.

==Transport==
[[Orkney Ferries]] sail from the island to [[Tingwall, Orkney|Tingwall]] on the [[Orkney Mainland]] via [[Wyre, Orkney|Wyre]] and Rousay.
