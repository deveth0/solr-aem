        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;The XY Notrump&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; [[Bridge convention|convention]] is a bidding convention in [[contract bridge]].

== Using the convention ==
After opener&amp;apos;s one of a suit (X), partner&amp;apos;s one of a suit response (Y) and opener&amp;apos;s 1NT rebid (a very common sequence), 2{{Clubs}} from opener&amp;apos;s partner forces 2{{Diams}} from opener. Holding a weak hand with diamonds, one can now pass. Other bids are invitational, describing also the nature of the hand. A 2{{Diams}} response to 1NT, however, is game forcing with any hand. Responder may also jump to 3 of any suit (except 3{{Clubs}}, which is signoff) to show a slammish hand with good suit(s).

== Examples ==
For example, on the sequence 1{{Clubs}}-1{{Spades}} (with our without opponent&amp;apos;s interfering);1NT-2{{Clubs}};2{{Diams}},2{{Hearts}} will show an invitational hand with minimum five spades and four hearts, 2{{Spades}} an invitational hand with minimum five spades (in which case one does not have four hearts) or possibly six spades with or without four hearts. 2NT will show a balanced invitational hand, 3{{Clubs}} typically an unbalanced invitational hand with club support. However, when one instead forces game with 2{{Diams}}, opener will immediately start describing his own hand. He may, on basis of the aforementioned auction, with 2{{Diams}} being the only difference, bid 2{{Hearts}} holding four hearts, 2{{Spades}} holding three card spade support, etc. Further bids are primarily natural.

== Advantages ==
XY Notrump gives very good control finding both games and slams, as the final &amp;quot;mission&amp;quot; of the sequence is established at a relatively early stage of bidding.

Playing, as very common in combination with XY no trump, the [[Walsh convention]] or even [[Transfer Walsh]], one still has the chance of stopping in 2{{Diams}} on weak hands, often impossible using for example [[Stayman convention#Checkback Stayman|Checkback Stayman]].

== Variations ==
A popular expanded version of XY Notrump is the so-called &amp;quot;XYZ&amp;quot; [http://bridgehands.com/X/XYZ_Convention.htm], meaning the principles of regular XY Notrump is valid even after a one of a suit (X) - one of a suit (Y); one of a suit (or notrump) (Z) auction. It replaces such a method as [[Fourth suit forcing]].

== Notes ==
* [http://bridgehands.com/X/XYZ_Convention.htm A publication on the XYZ variation of the XY Notrump convention]
* [http://org.ntnu.no/mareritt/boasys04.pdf A system publication based on Baard Olav Aasan methods, concerning particularly Transfer Walsh and XY no trump (in Norwegian)]
