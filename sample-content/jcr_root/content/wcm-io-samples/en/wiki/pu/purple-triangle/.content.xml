The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;purple triangle&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[Nazi concentration camp badges|concentration camp badge]] used by the [[Nazi party|Nazis]] to identify &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Bibelforscher&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (the German name for [[Jehovah&amp;apos;s Witnesses]] and other [[Bible Student movement|Bible Students]] congregations) in Nazi Germany. A small number of Adventists, Baptists and pacifists (less than one percent) were also identified by the badge.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Johannes S. Wrobel, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Jehovah’s Witnesses in National Socialist Concentration Camps, 1933 – 45&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Religion, State &amp;amp; Society, Vol. 34, No. 2, June 2006, pp. 89-125 &amp;quot;The concentration camp prisoner category ‘Bible Student’ at times apparently included a few members from small Bible Student splinter groups, as well as adherents of other religious groups which played only a secondary role during the time of the National Socialist regime, such as Adventists, Baptists and the New Apostolic community (Garbe 1999, pp. 82, 406; Zeiger, 2001, p. 72). Since their numbers in the camps were quite small compared with the total number of Jehovah’s Witness prisoners, I shall not consider them separately in this article. Historian Antje Zeiger (2001, p. 88) writes about Sachsenhausen camp: ‘In May 1938, every tenth prisoner was a Jehovah’s Witness. Less than one percent of the Witnesses included other religious nonconformists (Adventists, Baptists, pacifists), who were placed in the same prisoner classification.’&amp;quot;.)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Nazism]] opposed unorthodox-Christian religious minorities (along with [[Jews]]), but made the Bible Students the object of particularly intense persecution, including such extensive incarceration that a distinct badge was assigned to them.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|author=MoreOrLess |url=http://www.cesnur.org/2006/sd_chryssides.htm |title=Bibelforscher |publisher=Cesnur.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaustrevealed.org/_domain/holocaustrevealed.org/badges.htm |title=Holocaust Revealed |publisher=Holocaust Revealed |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
