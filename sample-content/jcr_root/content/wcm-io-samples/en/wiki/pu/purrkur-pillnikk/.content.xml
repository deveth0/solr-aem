&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Purrkur Pillnikk&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;Sleepy Chess-Player&amp;apos;) was a  [[Rock music|rock]] band from late [[Punk rock|punk]] era in [[Iceland]]. The band existed for 18 months (1981–1982) and were very active as they released at least two LPs, one live-album and two EPs. The distinguishable character of the band were Einar Örn&amp;apos;s howling and off-key singing and his lyrics that most often described very day-to-day things but with a lot of interwoven angst. Members of the band later found themselves in [[KUKL (band)|KUKL]], or in 1986 in [[The Sugarcubes]].

The members were: [[Ásgeir R. Bragason]], [[Bragi Ólafsson]], [[Einar Örn Benediktsson]] and [[Friðrik Erlingsson]]. The three latter ones formed [[Bad Taste (record label)|Smekkleysa/Bad Taste]] publishing house in [[Reykjavík]] with friends and were also members of The Sugarcubes.

Their records were: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Tilf&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a 7&amp;quot; EP containing 10 songs and lasting about 12 minutes in total; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ehgji en&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, an LP containing 17 songs; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Googooplex&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a double 45RPM album containing 13 songs; &amp;apos;&amp;apos;No Time to Think&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, a 7&amp;quot; EP containing 4 songs; and the posthumous live LP &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Maskínan&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, containing 17 songs including several not on the other records, most notably a 5-song suite entitled &amp;quot;Orð fyrir dauða&amp;quot; (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Words before death&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) specifically written for their swansong concert at the [[Melarokk]] festival in August 1982. They also had a track on the [[ROIR Records]] compilation World Class Punk.

The band toured Britain with [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]] in 1982. Some of those dates are listed below:

Monday 3 May - [[Band on the Wall]]&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
Tuesday 4 May - Band on the Wall&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
Wednesday 5 May - [http://www.bandonthewall.org/history.htm Band on the Wall]

Recently, popular Icelandic dance outfit [[GusGus]] released a song entitled &amp;quot;If you don&amp;apos;t jump&amp;quot; which samples Purrkur Pillnikk&amp;apos;s signature song, &amp;quot;Augum úti&amp;quot;.
