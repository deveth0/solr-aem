        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Publius Claudius Pulcher&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (d 249 BC/246 BC) (of the [[Claudius (gens)|Claudii family]]) was a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] general. His father was [[Gaius Claudius]]. He was the brother of the famous Roman politician [[Appius Claudius Caudex]] (consul in 264 BC). He was the first of the [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii]] to be given the [[cognomen]] &amp;quot;Pulcher&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;handsome&amp;quot;).

He was curule [[aedile]] in 253 BC and [[consul]] in 249. As consul he was given command of the Roman fleet during the [[First Punic War]]. He lost the [[Battle of Drepana]] against the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] after ignoring a bad omen when the sacred chickens refused to eat. According to [[Valerius Maximus]], [[Suetonius]][http://bcs.fltr.ucl.ac.be/suet/TIB/texte.html#2] and [[Cicero]], Claudius threw them into the sea, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;ut biberent, quando esse nollent&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (&amp;quot;so that they might drink, since they refused to eat&amp;quot;). He was recalled to [[Rome]] and ordered to appoint a [[Roman dictator|dictator]]; his nomination of his subordinate Marcus Claudius Glicia was overruled. He was tried for incompetence and impiety and was fined, and died soon afterwards, possibly by [[suicide]].

He was the father of [[Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul 212 BC)|Appius Claudius Pulcher]], consul in 212 BC
