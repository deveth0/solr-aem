&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Pu Songling&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{zh|t=蒲松齡|s=蒲松龄|p=Pú Sōnglíng|w=&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;P&amp;apos;u Sung-ling&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;}}, June 5, 1640—February 25, 1715) was a [[Qing Dynasty]] [[Chinese people|Chinese]] writer, best known as the author of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;.

==Biography==
Pu was born into a poor landlord-merchant family from [[Zichuan District|Zichuan]] (淄川, now [[Zibo|Zibo, Shandong]]). At the age of nineteen, he received the gongsheng degree in the [[Chinese examination system|civil service examination]], but it was not until he was seventy-one that he received the xiucai degree.

He spent most of his life working as a private tutor, and collecting the stories that were later published in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. Some critics attribute the [[Vernacular Chinese]] novel &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Xingshi Yinyuan Zhuan]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; to him.
