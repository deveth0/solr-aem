In [[heraldry]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;purpure&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]], more or less the equivalent of the colour &amp;quot;[[purple]]&amp;quot;, and is one of the five main or most usually used &amp;apos;&amp;apos;colours&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (as opposed to &amp;apos;&amp;apos;metals&amp;apos;&amp;apos;).  It may be portrayed in [[engraving]]s by a series of parallel lines at a 45-degree angle running from upper right to lower left from the point of view of an observer, or else indicated by the abbreviation &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;purp.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

Purpure has existed since the earliest periods, for example in the purpure lion of the arms of [[Kingdom of León|León]]; at that time, it was painted in a greyer shade. However, it has never been as common as the other colours, and this has led to some controversy as to whether it should be counted among the five common colours.  In French heraldry, the colour is usually excluded from the common colours as well as considered &amp;quot;ambiguous&amp;quot; (could be either &amp;apos;&amp;apos;colour&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;metal&amp;apos;&amp;apos;), and {{citation needed span|text=Finnish heraldry restricts its use to certain additaments.|date=June 2013}}

There is at least one instance of it being blazoned as &amp;quot;Imperial Purple&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;{{cite web|last=John|first=Cilia La Corte|title=Sperver|url=http://www.dictionaryofheraldry.com/Sperver.htm|publisher=John Cilia La Corte|accessdate=1 January 2012}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Purpure is said to represent the following:

* Of jewels, the [[amethyst]]
* Of heavenly bodies, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]
** (The planet Mercury is further associated with the element mercury or &amp;quot;quicksilver&amp;quot; in traditional [[Classical_planets_in_western_alchemy|alchemical/occultistic lore]])
