&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Puurs&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{IPA-nl|ˈpyːrs}}) is a [[Municipalities of Belgium|municipality]] located in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] province of [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]]. It is located in the [[Flanders|Flemish Region]]. The municipality comprises the towns of [[Breendonk]], [[Liezele]], [[Kalfort]], [[Ruisbroek]] (old spelling: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Ruysbroeck&amp;apos;&amp;apos;) and Puurs proper. There is also the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Kalfort]]. On January 1, 2006 Puurs had a total population of 16,029. The total area is {{convert|33.41|km²|0|abbr=on}} which gives a [[population density]] of 480 inhabitants per km².

Puurs sits about 5 meters above main sea level. Its geography shows only minor elevation differences (so it&amp;apos;s basically flat).

Puurs is mainly rural, with some low intensity industry development in the North alongside the N16 motorway. However, because of its proximity to the cities of Antwerp and Brussels (both within a 25&amp;amp;nbsp;km radius) and its excellent accessibility, Puurs is developing increasingly into a residential town.

==History==
Signs of habitation dating back to the [[Iron Age]], as well as early Roman and [[Merovingian]] times, have been found in Puurs.

Arguably, the [[Benedictine]] abbeys of Saint-Cornelimunster of Aachen were the lords of Puurs in the 10th century A.D. In 1278 the municipality was acquired by the Abbey of Sint-Bernard&amp;apos;s upon [[Scheldt]], whose property it would remain until the end of the 18th century.

==Points of interest==
=== Saint-Peter Church ===
Puurs&amp;apos; Saint-Peter Church is quite large and is hence sometimes referred to as the region&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;cathedral&amp;quot;. It was built in the 15th century, on the remains of a roman-style church. The baroque-style bell tower was added in the late 17th century. The classical center piece was completed in 1744.

===Asparagus===
The lands of Kalfort are widely renowned for producing the most delicious [[asparagus]], and at the beginning of summer a festival is held in honour of this &amp;quot;white gold&amp;quot;.

===Beer===
The internationally sold [[Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat|Duvel]] beer is brewed in [[Breendonk]], by the Duvel-Moortgat brewery. Each year in August, a 100&amp;amp;nbsp;km long foot march called the [[Dodentocht]] (Death March) passes at the breweries, and participants and spectators can enjoy Duvel beer for free.

===Nazi Prison Camp===
[[Fort Breendonk]] was used by the Nazis as a political prison camp. It is kept in its WWII state and is open for visiting. Fort Breendonk and its twin sister Fort Liezele (which now serves as a municipal recreational area) were initially built by the Belgian military just before WWI, as part of a string of fortresses (the [[Réduit national]]) designed to protect the approaches to [[Antwerp]]. Since 1976, the site of the fort has been part of the municipality of [[Willebroek]].

===Railroad===
The [[Dendermonde-Puurs Steam Railway]] is a [[heritage railway|heritage railroad]] that links up Puurs and [[Dendermonde]]. The maintenance road that runs alongside serves as a bicycle track. Bikers can leave the track in [[Sint-Amands]] and follow the scenic route up North on the banks of the river [[Scheldt]].
