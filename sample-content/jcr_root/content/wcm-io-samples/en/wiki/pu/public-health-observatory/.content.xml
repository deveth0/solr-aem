        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;public health observatory&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (PHO) is a [[public health]] and
[[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] project.  It uses the word [[observatory]], from [[astronomy]], to emphasize a degree of detachment and objectivity in [[measuring well-being]].

[[Public health]], [[environmental health]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[recreation]], [[outdoor education]], [[exercise]] and other concerns are explored by most public health observatories.

The London Health Observatory has pioneered methods in measuring [[social capital]] and how this affects [[healing]] and [[health]] in general.

There is a network of public health observatories, one in each of the nine regions in England; there are also health observatories in [http://www.publichealthwalesobservatory.wales.nhs.uk/ Wales], [http://www.scotpho.org.uk/ Scotland] and [http://www.inispho.org/ Ireland]. The [http://www.noo.org.uk National Obesity Observatory] (NOO) and the [http://www.chimat.org.uk Child and Maternal Health Observatory] (ChiMat) are funded by the Department of Health to provide objective specialist expertise in their respective areas. There is also an  [http://www.injuryobservatory.net/ Injury Observatory for Britain and Ireland] (IOBI) and a [http://www.nepho.org.uk/mho/ Mental Health Observatory].

The [http://www.apho.org.uk/ Association of Public Health Observatories] (APHO) represents the entire network of public health observatories across the UK and Ireland.
