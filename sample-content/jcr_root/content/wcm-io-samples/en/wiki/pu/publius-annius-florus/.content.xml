&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Publius Annius Florus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[poet]] and [[rhetoric]]ian, identified by some authorities with the historian [[Florus]].

The introduction to a dialogue called &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Virgilius orator an poeta&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is extant, in which the author (whose name is given as Publius Annius Florus) states that he was born in [[Africa]], and at an early age took part in the literary contests on the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]] instituted by [[Domitian]]. Having been refused a prize owing to the prejudice against African provincials, he left Rome in disgust, and after travelling for some time set up at [[Tarragona|Tarraco]] as a teacher of rhetoric.

Here he was persuaded by an acquaintance to return to Rome, for it is generally agreed that he is the Florus who wrote the well-known lines quoted together with [[Hadrian]]&amp;apos;s answer by [[Aelius Spartianus]] (&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hadrian&amp;apos;&amp;apos; I 6). Twenty-six trochaic tetrameters, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De qualitate vitae&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and five graceful hexameters, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De rosis&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, are also attributed to him.

Florus is important as being the first in order of a number of 2nd century African writers who exercised a considerable influence on [[Latin]] literature, and also the first of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Neoteric|poetae neoterici]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;novelli&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (new-fashioned poets) of Hadrian&amp;apos;s reign, whose special characteristic was the use of lighter and graceful metres (anapaestic and iambic dimeters), which had hitherto found little favour.

The little poems will be found in [[E. Bahrens]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Poëtae Latini minores&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1879–1883); for an unlikely identification of Florus with the author of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Pervigilium Veneris]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; see [[E. H. O. Müller]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;De P. Anino Floro poéta et de Pervigilio Veneris&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1855), and, for the poet&amp;apos;s relations with Hadrian, [[Franz Eyssenhardt]], &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Hadrian und Florus&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (1882); see also [[Friedrich Marx]] in Pauly-Wissowa&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Realencyclopädie&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, i. pt. 2 (1894).
