        text="&lt;p&gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Snare technique&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is the technique used to play a [[snare drum]].

It is studied:

* As an end to itself by [[snare drum]]mers.
* As a way of developing stick control skill by [[drum kit|kit drummers]] and players of other [[auxiliary percussion]] instruments.

==Grips==
{{main|grip (percussion)}}
There are two categories of grips used in snare technique: [[matched grip]], in which both hands hold the sticks in an overhand grip, and [[traditional grip]], in which one hand uses an overhand grip and the other an underhand grip. Traditional grip is almost exclusively used on [[snare drum]], and concert [[bass drum]], while matched grip is used on all percussion instruments. Traditional grip is also primarily used in drum corps style marching environments, such as [[Drum Corps International]].

==Rudiments==
{{main|drum rudiment}}

Snare drum technique is learned mainly by learning specific sequences of drumstick strokes, each of them known as a [[drum rudiment]] and most of them short. Examples of rudiments are the [[paradiddle]] and the [[drum roll]].
