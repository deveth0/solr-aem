&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aesacus&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Aisakos&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; ({{lang-grc|Αἴσακος}}), in [[Greek mythology]], was a son of King [[Priam]] of [[Troy]]. Aesacus sorrowed for the death of his wife or would-be lover, a daughter of the river [[Cebren]], and was transformed into a bird.

The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; makes Aesacus son of Priam&amp;apos;s first wife [[Arisbe (daughter of Merops)|Arisbe]], daughter of [[Merops (mythology)|Merops]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; 3.12.5.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Apollodorus and [[Tzetzes]] also make Aesacus a seer who has learned the interpretation of dreams from his grandfather Merops.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Tzetzes. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Scholiast on Lycophron&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 224.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; For them Aesacus is the interpreter of [[Hecuba|Hecabe]]&amp;apos;s dream when Hecabe gives birth to [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]. In Apollodorus the deceased daughter of Cebren for whom Aesacus mourns is his wife named Asterope.

In [[Ovid]]&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Metamorphoses&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, Aesacus is an illegitimate son of King Priam secretly born to the nymph Alexirhoe, daughter of the river [[Granicus]]. Aesacus avoids [[Troy|Ilium]], preferring the countryside. One day he catches sight of the nymph Hesperia, daughter of the river [[Cebren]], falls in love, and pursues her. However, as Hesperia flees a venomous snake strikes her and she dies. Aesacus, unable to bear living any longer, leaps from a tall cliff into the sea but as he plunges he is changed into a bird by [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]]. Aesacus still attempts to dive into the depth yet continues still to live in the form of a diving bird.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Ovid. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Metamorphoses&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, 11.749-759.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
