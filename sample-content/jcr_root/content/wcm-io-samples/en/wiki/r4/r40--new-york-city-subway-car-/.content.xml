The &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;R40&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a [[New York City Subway]] car built between 1967 and 1968 by the [[St. Louis Car Company]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], serving the [[B Division (New York City Subway)|B]] ([[Independent Subway System|IND]]/[[Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation|BMT]]) Division.

==About==
The R40 fleet was numbered 4150–4349; cars 4250–4349 were originally numbered as 4350–4449 until 1970 (cars 4150–4249 retained their original numbers). These cars were unique for their 10° slanted end, designed by the firm of [[Raymond Loewy and Associates]].

The first incomplete pair of R40s (cars 4350 and 4351) came onto TA property in November 1967 for promoting the Transportation Bond issue on Election Day. On March 23, 1968, the R40 fleet entered service on the {{NYCS|F}} train.

The [[New York City Transit Authority]] found great dangers along with other hazards with the slanted end design posed with the lack of handholds for riders walking between cars, thus the danger of the passenger falling onto the track, and other flaws. Within months, the cars were retrofitted with large grab rails with pantograph gates, which effectively destroyed Loewy&amp;apos;s design, but allowed passengers to safely travel between cars.

Between 1987 and 1989, the R40s were rebuilt by [[Sumitomo Group|Sumitomo]] in [[Elmira Heights, New York]] and retrofitted with [[air conditioning]] and a new interior design.

In January 2008, pair 4192-4193 were displayed in the [[New York Transit Museum]];&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;NYCSubway1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?79128 |title=Showing Image 79128 |publisher=Nycsubway.org |date=2007-12-28 |accessdate=2009-08-19}}&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; this pair was later reefed. As of November 2009, pair 4280-4281 were designated to be preserved instead.

The [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160]] order has replaced all of the R40 fleet. The last pair (4256-4257) made its final trip on June 12, 2009 on the {{NYCS|A}} service with a consist of [[R40A (New York City Subway car)|R40A]] slants, which were retired the same day. Pair 4162-4163 have been assigned to school training and is at the [[East New York Yard]]. Pairs 4162-4163 and 4442-4443 are school cars.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/R-40_--_R-40M_(St._Louis_Car)&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;
