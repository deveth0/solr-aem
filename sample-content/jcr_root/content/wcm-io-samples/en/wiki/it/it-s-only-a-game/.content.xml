&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;It&amp;apos;s Only a Game&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; was a sports-and-game-oriented comics panel by [[Charles M. Schulz]], creator of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Peanuts]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which ran from 1957 to 1959.

Schulz and cartoonist [[Jim Sasseville]] (who also assisted Schulz on &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peanuts&amp;apos;&amp;apos; stories for various comic books) produced this strip which appeared in newspapers four times a week, including Sundays.  Despite the resemblance to the children in &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peanuts&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, most of the characters in these cartoons were adults.  The comic, unlike most other sports comics, focused on many amateur sports, like golf and ping pong.

The strip was modestly successful, but given the growing popularity of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Peanuts&amp;apos;&amp;apos; and the resulting demands on his time, Schulz canceled the strip after 63 weeks.
