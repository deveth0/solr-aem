{{nihongo|&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Itami&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;|伊丹市|Itami-shi}} is a [[cities of Japan|city]] located in [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], [[Japan]].

As of 2008, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 194,488 and a [[population density]] of 7,790 persons per km². The total area is 24.97&amp;amp;nbsp;km².

The center of Itami became a wealthy town by the middle of [[Sengoku]] period. It was named Itami-go (town of Itami) and known as the only Japanese town within a castle (usually Japanese castles were located far from domestic areas). Itami-go was a part of Castle Arioka which Araki Murashige ruled under [[Oda Nobunaga]]. After the uprising and defeat of Araki, the castle was torn down.

Today&amp;apos;s city was established on 10 November 1940. Great portions of the city were damaged in the [[Great Hanshin Awaji earthquake]] of 1995, but were quickly rebuilt.

Most of [[Osaka International Airport]] is located in Itami (hence the common name &amp;quot;Itami Airport&amp;quot;): it is [[Osaka]]&amp;apos;s primary domestic airport, although all international flights and many domestic flights shifted to [[Kansai International Airport]] in 1994. Despite the airport&amp;apos;s association with Itami, the terminal complex in truth sits in the neighboring city of [[Toyonaka, Osaka|Toyonaka]], and the Itami city center is connected to the airport only by a long [[tunnel]] that passes beneath the runway and tarmac.

The city is also famous for Koyaike Park, which features a large model of the [[Japan]]ese archipelago set in a circular pond. The park is a frequent sight for passengers on flights into Itami Airport. Moreover, Itami is one of the important [[sake]]-brewing cities in Japan. Some historians claimed Itami was the place where seishu, clear sake, was invented.

On January 20, 2009, a 69-year-old man injured in a traffic accident in Itami died after paramedics spent more than an hour negotiating with 14 hospitals before one admitted him.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;man_died&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090204/ap_on_re_as/as_japan_medical_care_denied Injured man dies after rejection by 14 hospitals], Yahoo News / Associated Press.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;

Itami sits on the [[Hankyu Railway]] [[Hankyu Itami Line|Itami Line]] and the [[JR Takarazuka Line]] ([[Fukuchiyama Line]]).

Sister city is [[Hasselt]], [[Belgium]].
