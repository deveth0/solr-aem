[[Image:Amphitheatre Italica, Spain.jpg|thumb|The Roman amphitheatre at Italica seated 25,000]]
The city of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Italica&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (Spanish: &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Itálica&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; north of modern day [[Santiponce]], 9&amp;amp;nbsp;km NW of [[Seville]], Spain) was founded in 206 BC by the Roman general [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus]] in order to settle Roman soldiers wounded in the [[Battle of Ilipa]], where the Carthaginian army was defeated during the [[Second Punic War]]. The name Italica bound the colonia to their Italian origins.

==History==
[[Image:SevillaMusArqS17 01.JPG|thumb|right|The 2nd-century Venus of Italica, found in 1940 near the theatre (Museo Arqueológico, Seville)]]
Italica was the birthplace of the Roman emperor [[Trajan]]. [[Hadrian]] was generous to his settled town, which he made a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;; he added temples, including a &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Trajaneum&amp;apos;&amp;apos; venerating Trajan, and rebuilt public buildings. Italica’s amphitheater seated 25,000 spectators—half as many as the [[Flavian Amphitheatre]] in Rome— and was the third largest in the Roman Empire. The city&amp;apos;s Roman population at the time is estimated to have been only 8000. The games and theatrical performances funded by the local aristocracy, who filled the positions of magistrate, were a means of establishing status: the size of the amphitheater shows that the local elite was maintaining status that extended far beyond Italica itself.

The modern town of Santiponce overlies the &amp;quot;old city&amp;quot; of Republican times founded by Scipio and the pre-Roman Iberian city. The well-preserved city of ruins seen today is the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;nova urbs&amp;apos;&amp;apos; magnificently laid out under Hadrian&amp;apos;s patronage.

A shift of the [[Guadalquivir]] River bed, probably due to [[siltation]]— a widespread problem in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] that followed [[deforestation|removal of the forest cover]]—left Italica isolated, high and dry. The city started to dwindle as early as the 3rd century. Later [[Seville]] grew nearby, and no modern city covered most of Italica&amp;apos;s foundations. The result is an unusually well-preserved Roman city of [[Hispania Baetica]], and unexpected riches in the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;Museo Arqueologico&amp;apos;&amp;apos; of Seville, with its famous marble colossus of Trajan. In Italica, cobbled Roman streets are visible, and mosaic floors still &amp;apos;&amp;apos;in situ&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. The excavation of Italica began in 1781 and continues.

==Modern day==
Following extensive excavations and the building of visitor facilities, Italica is now a popular destination for [[tourism|tourists]].

The ruins of the city also host an annual [[cross country running]] competition every January: the [[Cross Internacional de Itálica]]. The mass race and children&amp;apos;s competitions attract hundreds of participants each year. The senior international competition has featured numerous [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships|world champions]] and (with [[IAAF]] permit meeting status) it is one of the world&amp;apos;s foremost annual cross country competitions.&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;[http://www.crossinternacionaldeitalica.es/interior.php?idi=es&amp;amp;apdo=presentacion Presentación] {{es icon}}.
