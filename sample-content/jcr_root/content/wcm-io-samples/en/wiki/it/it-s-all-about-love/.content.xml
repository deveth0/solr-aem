&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;It&amp;apos;s All About Love&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a 2003 [[Romance film|romance]]-[[Drama film|drama]] film written and directed by [[Thomas Vinterberg]]. Its narrative can be classified as [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic science fiction|apocalyptic science fiction]], but Vinterberg prefers to call it &amp;quot;a dream&amp;quot;.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Unlike the director&amp;apos;s earlier Danish-language films, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;It&amp;apos;s All About Love&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is entirely in English and stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Claire Danes]] and [[Sean Penn]]. The production was led by Denmark&amp;apos;s [[Nimbus Film]], but the film was largely an international co-production, with involvement of companies from nine different countries in total. It was very poorly received by film critics.

==Cast==
* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as John
* [[Claire Danes]] as Elena
* [[Sean Penn]] as Marciello
* [[Douglas Henshall]] as Michael
* [[Alun Armstrong (actor)|Alun Armstrong]] as David
* [[Margo Martindale]] as Betsy
* [[Mark Strong]] as Arthur
* [[Geoffrey Hutchings]] as Mr. Morrison

==Production==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
The film was written, directed, and produced by [[Thomas Vinterberg]] over a period of five years. It was produced through [[Nimbus Film]].

At a certain point during production Vinterberg called up [[Ingmar Bergman]] and asked him to come and help him finish the film, as he felt he could not complete it himself. Vinterberg recalled that:

:He roared with laughter and said I had to be out of my mind. There was nothing he was less interested in. And he also said I was an idiot that had not decided fast enough what to do after &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[The Celebration]] (Festen)&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, which he, by the way, called a masterpiece. It was a very contended conversation.

(From an interview in [[Berlingske Tidende]].)

==Reception==
The film was not very successful, and critics mostly panned it.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;RT&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Rotten Tomatoes [http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/its_all_about_love/ rating]: 14% positive. For individual reviews, see box on the right.&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; [[Richard Roeper]] called the film &amp;quot;like [[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick]] with a talent-ectomy&amp;quot; and Jack Matthews of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[New York Daily News]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos; declared that &amp;quot;Surely, Vinterberg was high on some inert gas when he embarked on it&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;RT&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; Dennis Lim of the &amp;apos;&amp;apos;[[Village Voice]]&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, however found something to like in the film:
:&amp;apos;&amp;apos;It&amp;apos;s All About Love&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is, by any measure, a colossal folly – ridiculed at its [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] &amp;apos;03 premier, supposedly disowned by its stars (rumor has it Claire Danes burst into tears upon seeing the end result) and jettisoned by original distributor [[Focus Features|Focus]]. But this $10 million Danish-British-French-U.S.-Japanese-Swedish-Norwegian-German-Dutch co-production is a film maudit for the ages &amp;amp;mdash; rapturous and inexplicable in equal measure.&amp;lt;ref name=&amp;quot;VV&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
