&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Zrenjanin City Hall&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is located at the Trg Slobode (Liberty Square) in [[Zrenjanin]], [[Serbia]]. It is a seat of the [[Zrenjanin]] municipality.

== History ==

Present-day [[Zrenjanin]] (formerly known as Veliki Bečkerek / Nagybecskerek / Großbetschkerek / Becicherecul Mare) was a seat of [[Torontál|Torontaliensis]] county from 1779. A great fire in 1807 destroyed almost every building in the city, including old county building. Construction works for a new building started in 1816 and were finished in 1820 under project of architect [[Joseph Fischer, architct|Joseph Fischer]]. After 70 years, county building was re-constructed under projects of two renowned architects from [[Budapest]]: [[Gyula Pártos]] and [[Ödön Lechner]].

The county building was added by right and left wings, modernised facade in [[Neobaroque]], new balcony, [[Zsolnay]] roof tile patterns and several other things like electrical lightning and telephone line. At that time, it was the most modern building in southern part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

Main stairs are decorated by three stained glasses, depicting personifications of &amp;quot;Justice&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Wisdom&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Power&amp;quot;. They were damaged during storm in the summer 2003, and repaired aftermath.

== Today ==

Zrenjanin City Hall is today a seat of Zrenjanin municipality authorities and [[Central Banat District]]. It is one of the most recognisable symbols of Zrenjanin, depicted on many postcards for 100 years.

== City park ==

In the building&amp;apos;s backyard there is a City park - created in 1887 after re-construction of the City Hall. It is decorated by fountain with a stork, many sculptures and mural depicting old Bečkerek fortress. It is opened for public during summer.
