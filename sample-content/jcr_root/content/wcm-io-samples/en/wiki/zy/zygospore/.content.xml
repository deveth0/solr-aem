        text="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;zygospore&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; is a [[diploid]] reproductive stage in the life cycle of many [[fungi]] and [[protist]]s.  Zygospores are created by the nuclear fusion of [[haploid]] cells.  In fungi, zygospores are termed [[chlamydospore]]s and are formed after the fusion of [[hyphae]] of different mating types. In many [[eukaryotic]] [[algae]], including many species of the [[Chlorophyta]], zygospores are formed by the fusion of [[unicellular]] gametes of different mating types.

A zygospore remains dormant while it waits for environmental cues, such as light, moisture, heat, or chemicals secreted by [[plant]]s. When the environment is favorable, the zygospore germinates, meiosis occurs, and haploid vegetative cells are released.

In fungi, a [[sporangium]] is produced at the end of a sporangiophore that sheds [[spore]]s. A fungus that forms zygospores is called a [[zygomycete]], indicating that the [[class (biology)|class]] is characterized by this evolutionary development.
